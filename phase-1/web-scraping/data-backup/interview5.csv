2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think DA personally, I think he's an offensive wizard in my opinion just because he's shown us on film -- like showing us what's going to happen next game, and when we go and execute what he's showing us, it works out for us every time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We struggled with the Miami Heat's zone a couple games and he was showing us what to get into, what to do. Then Christian had that big game, all off cuts and just following what DA was saying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So I think offensively there's not much better that I've seen as far as offense, and that's why I think we have one of the best offenses historically. I think that's a big reason why."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We love him over here, and if he didn't leave to go get a head coaching job, that's good for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, they had MPJ, Mal, Jok, Paul Millsap. We had dogs on this team already. It was kind of just like I felt like the missing piece a little bit. When I got traded here, I feel like we were on our way to a championship that year, and then a couple injuries happened and we don't get it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"But now I feel like we're here, and the team is put together, the pieces all fit, and now you can see the puzzle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think as a young basketball player, this is what you -- this is like the pinnacle of what you want to get to. I think any championship, whether it's high school, college, they all mean a lot, but to win a championship against the best players in the world, we've already played against some of the best players in the world in this playoff run on our way to be here, so to get this trophy, it's like a big thing you check off the list."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,Like this is probably the biggest thing you could check off the list as a basketball player. I think we all kind of feel that way.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Well, just not breaking down on defense. I think in the one game where they shot a lot of threes and made a lot of threes, we had far too many breakdowns. I think if we execute the defensive game plan, we'll be fine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"For me, appreciate Gallo. For me, the first person that reached out was Klay, in the X-ray room. That meant a lot to me. That helped me a lot. Understand that from the get-go, it's going to be a long journey. Just seeing his face in that moment, and you could tell he was still recovering from his injury and he was still hurt mentally. It just helped me a lot get through, knowing I'm going to be in a dark time. It's not going to be a cakewalk."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"Basically, a lot of guys did. It's hard for me to single out a few. But Gallo was one, all my old teammates."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'm just happy to be in this position, knowing that everything I did to rehab was solid."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it's the realization, I think is one of the biggest things. Everybody talks about, don't want to miss an opportunity, or when you miss an opportunity, you're like, damn, that was a good opportunity for me to have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just think, thinking about all the things I've done growing up, all the things I wanted to do growing up, being here is one of them. So I don't want to miss the opportunity. So like I said, knowing is not enough. It's good to know it and realize it, but you have to go out there and motivate yourself to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"For me, just keeping that mindset. All martial arts, not just basketball, all martial arts stuff helped me with life and navigate that way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's long before we made it here that I thought this was going to happen. I had a belief of being in the playoffs before, having the experience, seeing the team and the chemistry grow, having the same core my whole career, that's when I saw it. That's when I believed it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"To be here just kind of rounds it out and shows that when we are given the right circumstances and everybody healthy, God willing, we can do it. I think when we're playing our best basketball, we are a very hard team to stop. I just see us playing like that for the majority of the time. Sticking together, even when we go through rough stretches, we're still in a good place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,I've personally had that belief for a very long time. No new confidence for me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, their shooters are moving on every drive. Duncan is flying off both ways off Bam. Strus is not shooting well, but he's getting some good looks. So we can't keep giving these shooters good looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"We know they are going to make shots, but as long as we keep our discipline and don't give them the open stuff, I think we are in a good spot. We gave them a couple easy layups, easy dunks last game. We take those away, we take away a lot of life they have and kind of just shut down their offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,We're staying home with shooters and allowing AG to play one-on-one with Jimmy a lot. The same thing with Jok. It feels like we are planning to take away the three and they are still get something good looks.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"So I think we are just keeping our awareness up on drives and those hesitation situations, offensive rebounds, finding the shooters, getting back in transition. Just taking the easy ones away and knowing that if they are going to hit shots, it's going to be over a contested hand."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. Maybe one day in practice laughter, but no."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's very smart with his tactics. The way they front him or deny him. We don't really fight the pressure we both get. Just seeing him make quick decisions, if the pass is open, there's no hesitation. Even if he turns it over sometimes, he takes what the defense is giving him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"Jokic is holding the ball for half a second longer and figuring it ou. He's been doing that for so long at all levels. He won his first MVP and his numbers were better than the second MVP, and his numbers are better during now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, yeah, I think there's more to come, actually, from Jok. I think we haven't seen a side of Jok that we are going to see where he can be just pure dominance all the way, the whole game, even more than he has been."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. I'd just say patience is key. Nothing happens overnight. I think we have done a great job, not just as a team but as an organization, sticking together, keeping each other up, motivating each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"We have got Stan and Josh in the locker rooms, win or loss, which means a lot. Just seeing everybody's faces. I still get messages from Tim. I get messages from Monte. Everybody is part of the journey and understands what we are about. It's just nice to see us be a big family and understand what it takes to win. But yeah, it's been a journey, a lot of fun. We have got more work to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"You know, they do a great job of just sticking to the system, whatever it is they do, whether it's defensively, offensively. You can definitely tell and have the feel of how much chemistry they have playing with each other, how well-coached they are, and no matter how things are going throughout the game, they just stick to what they do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"That's a credit to them, just how well they continue to do it and how well mentally they are prepared no matter how the game is going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, it's definitely a different scout for sure. You get a different feel. For me personally I get a different feel out there, kind of being a little bit more of a priority, closing out, knowing where you're at, knowing when it's time to cut and those type of things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Like I said, that's part of them sticking to the system. They've done a great job of having a game plan and sticking to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"But that's what it's all about getting to this point of the season. They're going to make things difficult, and it's going to be our job to do the same on the other end. We've got to continue to find ways to find cracks whenever we can, and I think we do a great job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,We'll have a great prep today and find better ways to be more effective on both ends.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, you've got to find that balance between being aggressive but not forcing anything, as well. Like we were just talking about, I've kind of been in that role where you kind of take what is given, and they've done a great job of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"The opportunities I've had have been a lot lower because of how they defend and what their system looks like. It might be a series in a game where I have to be more assertive and be more creative and find ways to get my attempts up because I think, like you said, last series my attempts were pretty high, probably the highest they've ever been in my career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"I think whenever I get -- have my attempts that high, I typically can be a pretty effective and efficient."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,I've definitely got to be more assertive but also within the offense. I'm a role guy. I've got to take what's given. But for sure I definitely need to find ways to be more assertive in that aspect for sure.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I think that, like you said, naturally everybody looks to the stars to get us past that game and get us to the next one, but we're a group of guys who depend and lean on each other, and that's what makes our team so great and our stars so great, that they're so unselfish."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"The trust factor they have in the other guys like us on the team, it pumps confidence into us, and they understand how important and key of a piece that we can be to get us to the next game, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"I think it's a collective thing to where we all understand we all need to elevate our games, and while also, like you said, the stars being the stars, and the role players gotta be stars in their roles."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I definitely get fuel while being disrespected. I felt like if someone doesn't believe I can do something, I typically find the best way possible to do it. That definitely gets my juices flying, like you said, especially airballing like 3 feet from the basket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"I'm not Steph or nothing like that, but I don't think I'm airballing three feet from the rim. Yeah, we've got to find ways to continue to be aggressive and have those internal battles all the time to keep things going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, we're definitely getting great looks. They're doing a great job of taking some things away from us. But I think we'll have adjustments to find ways to get our guys going. That's their job, is to take away certain things, big muscle things for us. That's been in their favor. We've got to take advantage of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"We're a great enough offensive team to where if you take something away, something has gotta give. We'll definitely find ways to be more impactful on that end for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, first off, it's real. That's been part of his upbringing through his father, Roger. Martial arts, the meditation, the visualization. That's allowed Jamal to get to this stage and perform at the level he's performing at. It's allowed him to recover from an injury that had him miss the last two postseasons."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The most important aspect of all of that for me is it's genuine, it's real. Jamal believes in it and he practices it. That allows him to go out and use it to help his game, help his body and help his mind. Whatever is going to put him in the right frame of mind, I'm all for because we all see what he's doing out there on the biggest stage of the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've long said that Jamal is not just a scorer. That's been my challenge to him. That should be an affront to him, that people just look at him as a scorer, because ever since he became a starting point guard, he is charged with the responsibility of running this team, making every one of his teammates better, on top of being an aggressive scorer looking for his shot, on top of being a rebounder at his size and physicality, as well as being an engaged defender."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The challenge is always for you to be an All-Star and All-NBA player, and for you to be the guy that is, along with Nikola, putting this team on your back, it requires commitment and effort all across the board."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know that he's capable of making his teammates better. He's shown that in the past. I think it's just constantly striving to become the best version of yourself. Jamal is really committed to trying to be the best version. That's allowing him to be a historical player and allowing him to have that in his first four Finals games, whatever it is, is just incredible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,Took off when I left. Thanks for reminding me laughter.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I have not spoken to Steve about those similarities. Obviously, when I was there, I worked for Mark Jackson and worked for, obviously, Bob Myers, was with Larry Riley at that time. But I think that's one of the real cool things about how we have gotten here. Everybody, every individual, more importantly, every team collectively has to pick a path and stay true to it. I feel really fortunate that our journey has been one of patience, one of drafting really well and developing those players, and then adding the right pieces around them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, you add an Aaron Gordon, a KCP, a Bruce Brown, whatever it may be. Everybody does it differently. Some teams want to mortgage their future and go get the surefire player, the All-Star. For us, there's never been a rushed mentality. That starts with the ownership. The Kroenke family has been phenomenal since day one allowing this thing to play itself out and not overreacting to other bumps in the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think there are other teams in this league that are looking at how we have done it, smaller-market teams, how we've done it. I think more teams will try to kind of make this a blueprint."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, it's not for everybody. This was the best course for us, and it's allowed us to get here. But once again, we still have a lot of things that we need to accomplish in order for us to become world champions. We know tomorrow night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I do. But the one word that I think isn't in your Finnish identity maybe that we really, really put a huge level of importance on is communication. If you just look at our series, we lost Game 2 at home and we gave up 17 threes that night. I felt our level of communication was not anywhere where it needed to be. You think about Game 1, they made 13. I think Game 3 they made 11 and Game 4 they made eight threes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yes, you have to trust. That's a big part of our culture. Being courageous is always something that's going to put yourself in a position to be aggressive. You have to have an aggressive mindset to be an effective defensive team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"But if you don't have communication and discipline to go along with that, I think you're going to be missing some really key components. That's allowed us -- I mean, I think in the three wins that we've had against Miami, they are averaging 94 points, and their field goal percentage and three-point percentage are really, really low."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,It's going to have to be even better tomorrow evening.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I would say regarding the team response, I thought it was outstanding. We went down to Miami. Won two games on the road. We did it by playing this great defense. So our guys really bought in and committed to not only playing harder for longer, but also just being a lot more connected and talking our defense and being disciplined. It was two great examples in Game 3 and 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"My biggest concern going into any close-out game is human nature and fighting against that. You're up 3-1. Most teams, when you're up 3-1, they come up for air. They relax and they just kind of take it for granted that, oh, we're going to win this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The neat thing for us is that going back to the bubble, we've been down 3-1. We've come back and won. We know anything is possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's why my message to our team before we came down to the media and open practice was our approach has to be we are down 3-1. They are desperate we have to be more desperate. They are hungry we have to be hungrier. There is no celebrating after Game 4. We have another game that we have to win, and the close-out game is always the hardest game ever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,So I'm looking forward to seeing our approach. We had it in Game 6 against Phoenix and Game 5 against Minnesota and Game 4 against the Lakers. My hope is tomorrow night in front of this incredible crowd and incredible environment that the players understand the opportunity in front of them and take full advantage of them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Stay in the moment and once that jump ball goes up tomorrow night, our players, every possession, every moment of that game can't be, ""We have to win this game."" We have to stay true to ourselves, trust what's gotten us to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The message after Game 4 in Miami was, everybody is yelling, ""Just one more win."" Hey, let's just win the first quarter tomorrow night. Take it in small bites. Take it in small bites. And if you do that possession by possession, quarter by quarter, hopefully when 48 minutes are over, you've done what you needed to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"But this team has been through a lot. The last two years, no Jamal Murray last season, no Michael Porter. To get back healthy and add some key pieces, this is a team that has been tested before and I think is really built for this moment. Our guys are excited for that opportunity tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think eight years with Nikola, and that was -- in our culture of being a work team, a selfless team and a trust team, that was day one when I got here. And then slowly but surely, culture is not a thing that you achieve and you cross it off your list. Culture is a thing that you have to work on each and every day, or if not, that culture is going to go away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"It just so happens that the two-time MVP and a great player in Nikola kind of embodies everything. To your point, when you have a guy that has had the success that Nikola has had, being your hardest worker and being as selfless as he is and trusting as much as he does, well, that allows everybody else to kind of fall in line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,So it's a real luxury as a head coach to have a player that kind of embodies everything that we are trying to do on a daily basis.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"There was no stress level. In that series against Phoenix, we won two games at home. They won two games at home. We realized that we were playing against a team that most people had picked to come out of the Western Conference. Understandably so, with the talent level that they had. So I can't say that they were stressed coming home to Game 5. We knew we had a terrific home-court advantage and our fans would show up and we'd play a lot better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think now when you go back to Phoenix and Game 6 and a chance to close it out, I didn't expect to be up 30 at halftime. But it just kind of speaks to our guys understanding that in the close-out game, we did not rely upon having Game 7 in our pocket to go home and play in front of our fans. We don't rely upon having three games to close out Miami. When you start relying upon things like that, you get yourself into trouble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that's why I say, tomorrow's game, we're down 3-1. This is a must-win for us, and hopefully, if that's the mentality our guys can go out there and play with, we'll put ourselves in a great position."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, honestly, even if we didn't have that team come back from down 3-0, I think we still believe. The one thing about it I'm sure you see the spirit around our guys, we believe in ourselves. We believe in what we can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, we know we're down. Unfortunately, we're down 3-1. But all we've got to do is take it one possession at a time, one minute at a time, one second at a time, and just continue to do what we do, believe in that game plan, understand what the game plan is, and just be positive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"At the end of the day, we've got a chance to go out there and play basketball. You've still got to go out there and put the ball in the hole and go out there and have fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think the turnovers hurt us last game a lot. I think getting shots on goal is always big for us as a group, and that's been throughout the whole year for our team is getting shots on goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we've just got to stay confident, and I think we are very confident in what we do and how we've gotten here and are each other's -- you know, all our teammates."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I think we know what we can do offensively. We just haven't done it. We feel like we know we can do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Kind of the same thing, right? You've got to always adapt, always adjust. It's always about understanding what's going on in the world. But at the same time, staying true to yourself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"We always say you stay true to yourself, how you write your articles, how you write your papers or whatever you write, how I play, how I work on my game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I know it's a funny thing to say I'm 37 years old and 17 years and the guys joke with me and they be like, oh, you listen to Gladys Knight, and stuff like that. They don't know who Gladys Knight is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"But they keep me young. I know that my mind, I can pass along the knowledge to them as much as I can. Udonis is up there with me, Kevin is up there with me. These guys keep me young, and the staying power is just believing in what you do and continuing to work, never being satisfied with, oh, yeah, I had a great career, da, da, da, but I still feel like I can do more, I can give more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I'm playing in my second NBA Finals, a chance to win another ring. That just motivates me more. That motivates me more, and it continues to keep me young and it continues to have me -- like, yo, I need to do something to get better. I need to do this, I need to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Also, yeah, I want to continue to help our league. Our league is important. We create generational wealth for our families, all the guys that come through this league. We have an opportunity to make a lot of money and provide for our families and do a game that we love, give back to our communities."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"For me, I just like to continue to pass along the information, but I'm still motivated to compete at the highest level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I'm not going to give Denver no type of tips, but I think from that 2019 thing, I think my team was just completely focused on the task at hand. I mean, it's different. We were on the road, so we knew what it was. We understood the situation. We understood the type of firepower those guys had. We knew exactly, hey, this could be a seven-game series, but we've got to stay focused on the task at hand."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"For us, going into tomorrow, we know the task at hand and we know what we can do and we know what we're capable of, so we've got to stay focused on that and being with each other no matter what."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, we would love to have that. We would love to have one of those games where they both do 50 points and we climb on their back. We understand it's all about them. We got to support them. At the end of the day, we got to give them as much help as we possibly can. Get them good looks. Get them the ball in situations that they can be successful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"The one thing about those two guys, they're going to be ready to play tomorrow. They're going to be ready to go tomorrow. For us, we've got to find a way to make sure we help them be successful. That's what it's about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"We can help them, they can get 50 and all that stuff, but we've still got to help them get 50 and be in the right spots and get them the ball in a successful place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"It's enjoyable, period. Honestly, yeah, like after games you're a little bit more sore or this or that, but the grind is so enjoyable. Like I said, I've got a great locker room. We've got a great locker room, great group of guys, great coaching staff, a group of guys that like being around each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"That's part of it. You build a bond of brotherhood for each other. You build a bond that is kind of unbreakable. You go back and say, oh, man, in 2000 whatever, we got this, and you've got a group of guys that have earned the opportunity to be here and have fought and clawed to have the opportunity to be here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"That's why the grind is so enjoyable for me is because I didn't have the best year health-wise and numbers-wise, but we're here with the opportunity to play basketball and I'm here with the opportunity to see these guys be successful and make shots and be on the biggest stage and help them want to get here again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"The grind is very much enjoyable. It's a little bit different some days, but it's always love."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Naturally when your back is up against the wall you start to look for answers, solutions. But we're a team that as you know has been super resilient. We understand that it's every possession, it's one game. I know that's something that is cliche and everybody says but again, we feel like if we come out, have a good start tomorrow, play extremely hard and give ourselves a chance and take it back to Miami, that is right where we want to be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"But again, tomorrow is one of those things where a close-out game is the hardest game of the series, always. Game 5 is always, always a tough game in the series if you can push it there. We just have to come out to our game, stick to our schemes both offensively and defensively. There are some things that have been glaring for us. We'll go out there and get the job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Since I've been here, been very vocal with the team, UD as well, having that championship pedigree and having been there before. But certainly Kyle having been up 3-1 and us being down 3-1 with the Cavs in 2016, we definitely have different viewpoints and things to give vocally to the team. So weve just been consistently in the guys ears to not let up and stay in the saddle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"She might have. She might have. Just, definitely need to get some rest now and get some sleep. Everybody is happy and healthy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Was able to make it in for our film session. Got a little bit of sleep, so today will be good to get up and down, get acclimated here and get some treatments, get some rest and be ready to roll."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"It's certainly been special. We don't feel like we have ever been a normal eight seed, getting in the second Play-In game and beating Chicago and just letting the chips fall. We've been a very resilient team, a team that is consistently giving effort, consistently giving endless support to each other. Our locker room has been amazing. Coaching staff has been amazing. Organization has been incredibly supportive. So any time you have that, you give yourself a chance to do some special things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Denver uses a great word about, I think they use it in terms of their offense but we certainly have applied it to who we are as a group and that's just be fluid, I love that word and not only how we play on offense but away from the court or going through this, we are very intentional and we are getting down to business, and we know the job at hand and the task at hand but at the same time we are fluid, we are loose, and you know, that is going to help us play in a moment like this when the lights are the brightest, to just play free and play that fluid style of basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I always say, he came to visit me a couple times back home in Serbia and he came to visit me even when I play with the national team in Lithuania -- was it Lithuania? Yeah, so he came around a couple times. My whole family just getting to know him. We got together. We did a couple fun things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"For the relationship, for the whole eight years, we have grown so much, not just on the court. He's a good guy. He always likes to visit me and we always appreciate him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,I really don't know. Probably it's good. I think it's good when you have a good relationship with your coach laughter. So I think it was good.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it means a lot, especially in the Playoffs. You can see the plays before. You can talk to it and know what's coming. Even in the first game, from the first game, you can see how we are as a team better in communication and maybe reading the plays and knowing when to help and when not to help."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we are growing even now in the Finals. Every game, we are better and better. I think that's probably the first and most important thing in defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"We are going to approach it as a must-win game. I know it's a big opportunity, and I think everybody knows. By reflection of the practice today, how everybody was locked in, I think we are going to be ready for tomorrow. Vets are there to do their job and keep us not relaxed, keep us tight. They are doing a really good job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think vets in this league are really important for our team, for whatever team. You need to have good vets."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I played with Monte a long time. Then when Jamal got hurt, we had really good connection on the court, I was always good with him on the court. Even my family, he was always around. He's a guy who I really like as a friend. Really funny guy. You can talk to him about anything. I like Monte."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Wilson Chandler texted me. I saw Mike Miller in Miami. Jameer Nelson texted me a couple -- I think when we get in the Finals. A bunch of guys, but those are the guys I can remember. All my Serbian comrades -- I'm going to say like that -- they all reach out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I love it. He's a great guy and I really appreciate him. He's here for a long, long time. I'm going to say ten years from a G League coach to a head coach in the NBA. It's a lot of respect for him and for his work. I think he deserves it. He's been seeing a lot. He's been through a lot. I think he deserves everything. I think he's going to do a great, great job there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, he is the second Serbian coach, being as NBA head coach. Igor Kokoskov first, he is second. The NBA is growing and people in the front office, I'm trying to see, maybe some other guys are willing to step up, and they are going to do a good job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, there is always Felipe who has been with me since day one. Jason Miller, a trainer, who was literally with me through everything, every injury, every pain. Sparky, who is working with me, came to Serbia a bunch of times. Sparky is always in the background."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,I'm just happy that I have the same guys around me the whole time. I'm going to do my best to keep them as much as possible around me because I like to stick with my people who have been with me from the beginning.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,I think it's not going to be emotional. It's going to be a job that we need to do to be done. I think we are ready. I think we are going to be locked in and ready to go. It's just going to be a game that we need to win.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, my role just overall is just always to be ready, and just when my number is called throughout this series, so I'm just going to continue to stay ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Obviously minutes have decreased, which it is what it is. I'm just trying to do what's best for the team and hopefully we can win, so I'm just ready when my number is called."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, they're big vets in this league. They've been through it all, won championships, so they know what it takes to get there and they know what it takes to come back from down 3-1."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"We're definitely going to look to them for a lot of advice because they've been in this situation before. It's big having them in the locker room. Them two OGs have won championships, Spo has won championships, so we have a lot of good leadership in the room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Just take it one game at a time. Just the main focus right now is getting back to the 305 and just go from there. It's not easy to be in the situation the Nuggets are in, up 3-1, because they're playing back at home for Game 5, so we're just going to take it one game at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"That's a great question. That this series is over. It's the first to four, not three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"He's definitely up there. His personality is humble, thoughtful. He's overall a great human being, very down to earth. So he's definitely up there in that top tier of favorite teammates for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"Oh, as a player, he's still up there in that top tier of teammates. I've played with a lot of legends in my time, and he's definitely up there skill-wise, IQ, ability with what he's able to do on the floor. He cracks the top 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, I already knew he could play defense. I think the media kind of just ran with this theory that he's not a good defensive player based on probably I guess he's not blocking shots I guess. I'm not even sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"But he has elite hands. You seen that last game, the way he's able to impact as far as his hands. His IQ of knowing where to be. Being in the right spaces. Obviously his rebounding is top tier. He's somebody who can rebound at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"We've always been like that. We're out here just shooting. We go through what we need to go through upstairs. That's the mental preparation where we're locked in, we're focused."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"But up here we're just getting shots in, getting ready to do media. I think we understand what we have to do tomorrow in order to close this thing out, and I think everybody is focused."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"No. We understand it's one more win. Before anything else happens, we understand that 48 minutes is what it's going to take for us to win a championship. We're focused on that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"That just shows the type of person he is. I think just the big stage, people are starting to realize how he is. Now the media are coming from everywhere. Everybody is getting an up close and personal look at who he truly is and his personality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"I've always seen it. Now it's you guys' turn. Just the local media, I don't think anybody paid attention to it. Now, bigger scale, biggest stage, everybody is focusing on more than just the basketball aspect of what Nikola brings. I've always seen that side of him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"Grace of God, man. I've just been coming in, doing my work, coming in every day, preparing myself to go to battle for my teammates. I've been blessed enough to have this opportunity to play 16 years, 15 years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I can't take no credit for that. I'm just out here doing my job on this side and trying to prepare myself each night to be there for my team.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"It's all about just being positive, I think. I think it's having that positive mindset every day, of the everyday grind of repetition and routine, having fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"I think that's what it's all about. I've had great teammates this year, alongside Ish, DJ. We have fun with the whole process of getting to this point, and I think it makes it joyful to wake up every day and do this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"It can get repetitive. It can get stressful because there are some bad days if you don't play well, you might not feel well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"But if you don't have a positive outlook on the bigger picture, the everyday grind, like I said, I think that is what makes it worthwhile coming in here every day and just having fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. Like I've always been saying, just because of the crowd, we get to come into the arena, get to feel that energy from the crowd."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"My family will be here. My kids will be able to experience it, as well. I'm looking forward to just that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I am. Still don't know the gender yet, but we'll find out, I guess, after tomorrow's game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah. We could be too excited or it could not go the way we want it. Tomorrow for us, it's just to be relaxed, composed, but take in the moment, enjoy it. Also just come out and play basketball how we've been playing this whole playoff and this series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Our mindset from the beginning of the Playoffs was to win a championship, and we know we're one game away. I'm always telling my teammates, don't get on the one-yard line and fumble the ball. We're here. Like I keep saying, just enjoy the moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We're going to come out and play as hard as we can, like we're down 3-1. That's the mindset we have. Continue to play great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It would be great. We could do something special for this organization and for this town and this city by winning their first championship. I'm excited for the game tomorrow, and I know my teammates are excited. We've just got to continue to get better and play as hard as we know we can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Second effort. We'll have to scramble sometimes throughout the game. But that second effort that we give to run them off that three-point line or get a contest or get a miss goes good in our favor, and that's what works for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,We're locked in. Our mindset is still we've got one game left. Job is not done. We're going to come in with a mindset to win tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But also got to have fun and enjoy this moment. This is the time where we can enjoy each other while we're on the basketball court, talk about anything besides basketball, but also being focused. We're out here just having fun with each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Just be aware, put body on body, load and just pay attention, honestly. But that's not the only time that there are cuts or offensive rebounds. We have to know where everybody is on the floor and do a better job of stopping individuals from getting cuts. It sounds really easy, but it's actually not because they have been doing it all year long. But gotta pay attention, be aware."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think so. I have to do a better job of getting guys open, whether it be off the screen or off my attacks, to make sure our shooters get the shots they normally get."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"All the film that we watch, we've got to find ways to do it. It's not easy. It's definitely not easy when you're in the Finals. They are paying attention to us as much as we are paying attention to them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"But we've got to be able to do it if we want to win. We do want to win, so we'll figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's at an all-time high because it always has been all year, it always will be, the belief that we have in one another. It stems from the amount of time that we spend with one another and how we actually enjoy being around one another. And we know what each other is capable of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"We didn't come this far to stop playing now, no matter what the odds are, the analytics. When we get out there, we've just got to compete. We've got to win one, and then we've got to win another one and then we've got to win another one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Same thing everybody has been saying Ain't nobody got to four yet. So keep playing. Stay in the fight. Knowing that if we get this one, we're on our way to do something special. So we've got to win three before they win one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Not long. There's nothing that you can do about it once you lose a game. You can get better and learn. You go into the next one and make sure you win, which is what we must do. The next three are legit must-wins, or we came this far for no reason. Let go of Game 4, 3, 2 and 1 and focus on the one that is next."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Absolutely nothing. I think I was a different player then. The team looked a lot different then. I don't even think about it. I think the group of guys that we have now, if that's what the game says you need to do, then maybe that's what happens."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I honestly don't think about 2020, 2021, none of that. We're in this time right now. So I have to be the best version of myself now, along with everybody else on this roster."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Not at all. At the beginning of this year, we talked about winning a championship, competing to get to this point. So that's always the goal. It's always a goal with the Heat. It's about winning. It's not about individual anything. It's about holding that trophy collectively as a unit, to be the best team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's where we're at. All the odds, 8 seed, dadadadada, nah, none of that matters. It's just two really good basketball teams. One has to get one win, and one has to get three. Let's just hope that the other that has to get three, gets three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, we can't be worried about that. We know we're playing against a great team. Obviously, they've been doubted the whole year and they made it this far for a reason. We've got to be focused, bring energy and still know our personnel extremely well and just be focused on winning the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"I think about it when it's time. I don't think about it 247. When I'm home, just chill with my dog. My family is in town."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"But when it's time to lock in, I'll lock in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, just like Jok, he's making the game extremely easy for us. He's penetrating the defense. They're putting two on him and he's finding the open man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"If they're going to do that, everybody else on the floor has to do their part. So look for him to do that every game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, P-Wat is going to be extremely good. He's putting in the work. He's coming in early. He's putting weight on. He's working on his three-point shot. But when he gets his chance, he's going to thrive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I don't think it's just us scoring the ball. It's our defense. We've held them in the 90s the last few games and that's why we've won the game. So it's been the defensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"I mean, I guess. I was just trying to be aggressive no matter who was in front of me. Duncan just happened to be the player there. He tries hard on defense. No disrespect to him. We've definitely had our matchups when we were younger back in New England. But it was just whoever was in front of me, attack."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"I was thinking about what color shirts they were going to be wearing earlier today when I first walked in the arena. But it's going to be crazy. It's going to be loud. The fans are going to be here probably early. But I can't wait. I feed off their energy, so hopefully it's going to be a big night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, it's just another game. You have to approach it like we have approached all the games in the Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"That's the crazy part about the Finals. I think that there's so many games that everybody has the same routine, and you've just got to approach it like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Obviously it's a big opportunity and you can't miss out on opportunities like this, so to close it out at home in front of our fans would mean a lot to us, and we know it would mean a lot to them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,This is an opportunity. We're not going to let them down. We're going to come out here and play our game and enjoy the moment.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, it would mean the world to us and to them. I think that's one of the biggest parts about this, is we get to come home -- obviously we dropped Game 2, but we get to come home and play in front of our fans and have a chance to close it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"It's a big opportunity. Any closeout games are really big opportunities, and just to be able to do it in Denver would mean the world to us. We're going to come out with the same approach, the same hungry mentality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"That's the biggest part, just don't have a letdown game. Just come out and be humble, be hungry, and finish the job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Man, he's great. I think I said earlier, you couldn't have found a guy that fits more perfectly alongside the guys we have. He came in here, he sits down and plays defense every single night, all 82 regular-season games, and he's been one of the best defenders in the Playoffs. Really good dude."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Obviously loves Denver. Just a good, fun dude to be around, and he fits perfectly with our roster. We're grateful for him and what he's done for us, and he's taught me a lot along the process. We're grateful for BB, and we've got one more game hopefully where he plays really well like he did last game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think I don't have it too bad. I think a lot of people want to talk to Nikola and Jamal, obviously. I don't have it too bad, but you've got to be grateful for this, obviously. Just to be in this position and have people that want to talk to you and want to hear from you is obviously a blessing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I don't have it too bad, and I'm just fortunate to be here and grateful to be in this position."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, it's huge. Like I said, you get a chance to close out in front of fans that haven't had this moment before. We're going to go out there, we're going to approach it like every other game, but we're hungry."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You've got to stay humble and be ready for the opportunity. You don't get many chances to close out the NBA Finals in five games, so that's the goal. That's what we're focused on. We're going to come here, we're going to play really hard, give great effort, and we know the fans will show up and do what they've done all year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,We're going to come out here and try to close it out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"Going back to the first day of training camp, that feels so long ago. I do remember everybody getting intense because it's competition. I feel like that's what brings out the best in us. We just start competing. Emotions start flaring and you get to the moment of truth. It's competition, bottom line. For us, it's competition. We leave it at competition, and that's what it is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"The difference y'all don't see is the will I feel like he plays with when he gets in the playoffs. Everybody expect it to be skill, talent, finesse. He brings a different element. It's rugged, it in the mud and it's winning basketball still."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"Everybody looks at one side and says, oh, we like the way they play, it's finesse, it's this, that and the third. He brings an element of no, we are in the mud, we are going to grind this out and, at the end of the day, we are still going to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,I know what it feels like to be in that position. I know what it feels like to be in that situation. We have had guys be down 3-1 in our locker room and them share their experiences and their stories.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"For us, man, it's the first to four. That's the mentality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"K-Love has been a great asset to our team, just not only on the court but off the court. Him sharing his stories, especially down 3-1, he talks about how they go into the locker room and have a conversation and they go out and will wins. It starts with just getting one, and then you go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"You build trust, connection, brotherhood. It goes down the list. But it all ends up us being connected and as one. I feel like when you have that much connection with somebody in the moments of truth, you all can be honest with one another that this needs to be done, this needs to happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"I think their offense is all unpredictable. He's a great passer, so everybody is live when he catches the ball. I don't think it's just the pick-and-roll. I think it's when anybody is sitting there, you're thinking they are not cutting, they are cutting. When you think a guy is not open, he might be open. So I feel like that's the biggest challenge that we have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"Obviously, when you have a special moment like that, you're obviously very happy no matter what situation you're in. To see the joy on his face for him having his baby, obviously, his wife is healthy and everybody is healthy throughout, that's the blessing that you get. That's the blessing he probably needed. That's great news for all of us that we probably needed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,Very unique because he brings a different style of game and different type of pace to the game. You can't scout it. It is what it is. The biggest thing for us is making him take and make difficult shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,He just started this process while we were in Denver. So it's one thing to be able to go through all of this. It's another thing to be cleared to play an NBA Finals game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Taking it one step at a time, and we are all really encouraged by the progress."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Laughter I'll start with that one. My two sons are just starting to get into soccer, football laughter. So hopefully we can get a ticket and hopefully I can take them to some games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In terms of mental toughness, yeah, that's like a muscle. First you want to get the type of guys that are built for this, and then you work at it constantly through the regular season and the playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And we had enough practice at that during the regular season, a lot of tough times and I thought the guys really handled it the right way in terms of letting that be something that made us stronger collectively, learn from those lessons."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And then, you know, during the playoffs, it's always about that. It's how you respond to things that you don't necessarily anticipate or things that you thought would go differently. That's so much of the playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And with this group, you know, the one thing I've definitely taken from them is they have a competitive will that's as strong as any group I've been around."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"You know, find a way to win. This is -- this is great competition. You know, I say that over and over, but this is what you want the Finals to be like."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Our guys, when I say they have a competitive will, they love to compete. They love big challenges. They love to have everything out there in front of everybody to see between the four lines, and you play for it. You compete for it, and you decide it between those four lines."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And this is a very compelling series. I think it's great for the fans out there because you're seeing some great, competitive basketball that doesn't necessarily fit into the conventional box, certainly their two guys and their team, and a thousand percent our guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's not the conventional way. But, you know, it can be done differently when it's about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. I thought we got off to a great start the other night, and that didn't necessarily translate as the game went on. They started to impose their competitive will on the game, and the game was more on their terms, more -- the tenor of the game was really more in their favor, and that's typically what happens when you're in the center of the ring, toe-to-toe. It's who can get who to blink who can get who to have to adjust who can get the game on their terms, and they were able to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But you know, we are fully capable of doing that as well tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It felt like we had opportunities offensively to score. Some strange things happened on some of these possessions, or just misses in the paint or some untimely miscues that led to turnovers. It's not as if they are scoring 130 on us. Just the context of when they would score or a breakdown that just kind of kept things at bay."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Every time we felt like we got it to six or eight, they were able to push it to 12. That was certainly a frustrating part of the game. Brown was a big part of -- some of his random drives and plays in the middle of the paint when you're expecting it to be Murray or somebody else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's been a little bit different each game. Tonight it was probably those quick hands, either stripping us when we had advantages on drives, the kick balls that Jokic does very well, deflected passes or just some miscues. It's not like we had 25 turnovers. But whatever the turnovers were -- 16 15 or 16 -- they just led to scores that were deflating going the other way when it felt like we had an advantage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So it's probably a combination of some of those timely against-us turnovers and then some makeable shots that we didn't make during those stretches when the game was in the balance, when it felt like it was four, six, eight, during those moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'll have to go back and track that, but that's where I felt like probably the advantages were missed the most during those moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's tough to say because Jokic was in foul trouble so they went to other things. Jokic shot some threes. That changes the dynamic a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"For the most part, I thought that that part of the game was okay. It's the Gordon dunks or cuts Porter had a couple cuts and then Brown, when Jokic was out, those drives and plays that were kind of just random plays, attacking plays, which he is fully capable of doing. Those were probably the most costly things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Everybody is already talking -- sorry to cut you off. Everybody is already talking about it. I've been in those games, Game 5. Those are not the easiest games, at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"All we're focused on -- I told the guys, feel whatever you want to feel tonight. It's fine. You probably shouldn't sleep tonight any amount of time. I don't think anybody will. We have an incredibly competitive group. We've done everything the hard way, and that's the way it's going to have to be done right now, again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,All we are going to focus on is getting this thing back to the 305. Get this thing back to Miami. And things can shift very quickly.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's going to be a gnarly game in Denver that is built for the competitors that we have in our locker room. By the time we are getting on that plane, all we're thinking about is get this thing back to Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We get an opportunity to play a super competitive game in a great environment. That's going to be an awesome environment. Our guys are built for that. They love that, and particularly, I'm sure, everything in the next, whatever, what do we have, three days in between. Yeah, we understand what the narrative will be, but that's the way it is with our team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It doesn't matter about confidence or not confidence or how we feel or what our mood is. Our guys love to compete. Our guys love to compete. We get another opportunity to compete and take this thing one step at a time. Get this thing back to the 305. We do that, all right snapping fingers. That's how quickly things can change."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Obviously, we have some things to figure out, but we have an extra day to do that. The mindset, you don't have to question that. That's what everybody is already thinking about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's going to be inspiring plays. You stack inspiring play after inspiring play. Right when I took him out, because that's when he was going to come out, it was about four and change, that was one of the most impressive multiple-effort rebounds. It reminded me, that's something Dennis Rodman would do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Then we are going to stack a bunch more of those kind of plays in Game 5. Our guys love this kind of deal with the stakes and the context of everything. We're not even going to think about what's after that. All we're focused on is getting this thing back to Miami.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I felt like the size was more of a factor in Game 1. I think there was miscues, lack of communication or rotations tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Now, he is fully capable of doing what he is able to do. He's big, he's athletic, he's a great finisher and he has a real good synergy, all that stuff. So you have to respect that, and then conquer it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Tonight, there are some more relief points that I think we could have handled better. That doesn't guarantee that we would have been able to get the stop. But my instinct says, before I got to the film, that it felt like more of those kind of things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, right now, disappointed as a group, and that's all right. We've got tonight to feel that, and then just becomes shifting that mindset."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Like you said, this is what this year's been all about for this group, so definitely not going to hang our heads or quit. That's not an option. It's not going to happen. So we'll band together and get on this flight tomorrow and find a way to figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"We'll watch it. Don't want to react, knee-jerk react to whatever it was right now. Obviously some of the cuts, some of the transition. We had some untimely turnovers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Some of it, like myself, is just keeping the ball in front. They have got some guys that were more aggressive tonight, so we've got to have solutions for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, they are helping a little bit less on drives, it seems. Scrambling. Definitely give some credit to them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"For us, it's going to be about being detailed and running good offense, which we are capable of doing. But yeah, as the series goes on, both teams are going to make adjustments. Not necessarily surprised by that. But they are a good team. They have got a good scheme, and it's on us to continue to try to figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Obviously it attracts a lot of attention, whatever action he is in. So when you garner that sort of attention and focus, people flying at you, he is good at creating advantages, putting two on the ball and finding somebody open. A lot of times it's on that short roll. He got some skips tonight as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,They are good cutting off the ball. It's going to require a lot of discipline. He's obviously scored the ball but also passed the ball well in this series. We've just got to continue to try to make it difficult on him.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Defensively for them, they switch a lot and try to blow stuff up to their guys, get them the ball, try to get them the ball. In theory, I guess it's a faster, more physical group. Offensively, player movement, ball movement."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, they are both intelligent players, always processing the game, trying to find spots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"For us defensively, we've tried to do some different things to slow them down. We've had some success in pockets. But like I said, they are great players. It's not like you're going to wipe them out entirely. They're so much the focal point of what they do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It's just going to continue on us to continue to obviously have a competitive will and spirit defending them. But then also, like you said, mixing it up and trying to do different things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I thought we had some big-time efforts on both ends of the floor, particularly defensively on both Murray and Jokic. I thought guys just flying around, doing everything they can. Caleb, in particular, Jimmy, Bam."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"So the effort is there, absolutely. That's something obviously you can control. So just continuing to build off that and just get a little more detailed with the execution on both ends."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"We believed and we knew how good we were for a few years now. So we're just focused, dialed in, and ready to do this thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"We're just ready to win a championship. We have the tools to do it. It's been on our minds for a while. We're just locked in. I don't think you've got to overthink it. We're just dialed in, ready to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"I mean, that's why we got him. That's why we got him. He's a dog. He's strong. He's physical. He's tough. He's chill. He brings everybody together off the court, and he's a selfless player. He's been solid this whole Playoffs, this whole season, the whole time he's been here. He's been great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,He just wants to win. We all want to win. I think we're all helping each other try to accomplish our goals.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, tonight it just felt like they were blitzing every pick-and-roll, just basically trying to limit my shot attempts, and I just wasn't fighting it. We've got a squad. We've got a lot of guys that can come and impact the game, a lot of guys playing with confidence, so I'm not going to fight it. Make an easy pass, and that's why I've got four other guys out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,My guys did a great job. Jeff hit a big three. AG was doing his thing all night. Bruce was hooping. We've got a lot of guys that can come in the game and hoop. You don't have to fight it. I'm not on a team where I've got to force it or hold the ball too long. I'll gladly give up if we're winning games.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"If Jok goes out, we got five other guys on the court. If I go out, same thing. Everybody is just playing for each other. Game is slowing down. I'm just picking my spots, when to pull up, when to pass, when to drive and get in the teeth of the defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"I felt like I impacted the game, and I really didn't shoot well. I had a lot of late-shot-clock, four-seconds-left, gotta-get-it-up shots. I'm going to live with those if everybody else is hooping. If I've got to take those for us to get shots every other time, then cool."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Everybody else stepped up and we had a lot of fun playing together. It was a team game and some guys played good for good stretches and some guys didn't and they'd pick it back up. Everyone that got in the game tonight hooped. All our vets gave us good energy on the bench and told us to stay locked in. Like I said, it was a great team effort today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he's energy. It's hard to bring that kind of defensive energy every night. He's running corner to corner on offense and guarding their best players, guarding pick-and-rolls, fighting over screens. He brings an energy. When we see him get into guys and into the ball like that, it just picks everybody else's intensity up. He's been doing that all season. Bruce too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, team game. Guys were just locked in, just trying to focus on getting the W tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, last series was up and down, guys were flying. Shots were going up against Phoenix, guys were going up and down. This game was more of execution, no turnovers, rebound, get stops and stay together, and Jok has been just doing a great job of communicating what he's seeing and what we've got to do out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. I wasn't even -- I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. Just whoever is out there is out there. It's not the first time he's sat down in the game before. So guys were just stepping up, making shots, playing the right way and having fun. Everybody came in the game and impacted it in a positive way. Yeah, everybody just stayed calm and played basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Oh, yeah. I imagined being here when I was very young. Just having fun and making the most of the moment. Yeah, it's been a long time. I think not just for me but for everybody -- most guys that play basketball, this is where you want to be. I think we're all just locked in and trying to get this done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, like I said, it's a different series. I don't know what LA scored every game, but the game felt a lot more up and down. This one feels -- like we're getting stops but they're getting back, as well. Coming down, I'm getting to the rim, getting chased down. We've got to slow down, execute. Lowry is doing a good job of calling what we're doing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"But we're all on a string. Everybody is rotating for each other. Even if we make a mistake, somebody is there to step up, and if that person makes a mistake, somebody else is there. Even if we don't get the stop, we're all in the right mindset. I think we're doing a good job of just playing for each other on both ends of the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, it's definitely something that we talked about as coaches going into this series, and even with the players and the importance of understanding that you have to be ready and willing and able to defend all 24 seconds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Kind of reminds me of San Antonio back in the day. They would be like the league leaders in their field goal percentage in the last five, six seconds of the shot clock."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"So they want a slower pace, if you will, and they really exhaust the entire shot clock. That's where your defense is really tested because that first rotation, that second rotation and then having the effort and discipline to continue to do that through the entirety of the clock. Something that our guys have done a really good job of, in my opinion."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's going to come down to our ability to guard the three-point line. To me, that's where the series will be won or lost. Can we take the three-point shot? The one game that we did not do that, obviously, Game 2, they made 17 threes. That opens up everything else for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, great memory, great recall. We lose Game 1, and then halftime we are down in Game 2 and Jamal has not played well to that point in time. The backstory to that was I don't think Denver had won in San Antonio in like a decade. So now we are looking at potentially going down to San Antonio 0-2. I think there were a lot of people clamoring for a change, which is what people do. They panic. Right now, people want Michael Porter out of the lineup. Michael Porter is not coming out of the lineup, man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"And that moment with Jamal Murray five years ago, our first play -- and I just remember grabbing him as the third quarter was getting ready to start, telling him I loved him and I believed in him and just go out and play his game. He won us that series in the second half, because now we go down to San Antonio 1-1, end up stealing that game in San Antonio and wind up beginning Game 7 on our home floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's when I think you saw that Jamal was built for this. No matter what was going on and the adversity he may have been facing, he is going to find a way to rise and show out on the biggest stage. He has done that ever since."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is a must-win for us. This is the Finals. This can't be human nature, ""We came down, got one game, we can relax."""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Each game, each possession, each quarter are way too important. As I told our players, when we got on that plane to come down here, it wasn't just to get one win. Our mindset is to go out there and take it tonight. It's been our mindset for Minnesota, Phoenix, Lakers and now Miami. Go out and take it, because they are not going to give it to us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,This is going to be a hard-fought game. We expect them to come out with great energy. Forget matching that. We have to exceed it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"He is 26 years old, man. This is the Finals. Whatever they throw at him, we are ready for. Our guys are ready, willing and able to go out there and do whatever it takes to get this win. And if that requires Jamal playing 44 minutes once again, so be it. We'll read the game as it plays itself out, but I know Jamal is definitely ready for that challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I don't think we are big-time favorites. We've never had that mindset. Throughout these playoffs, we've been the underdog quite a few times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"You're in the NBA Finals. They are here for a reason. We are here for a reason. I think you can see in the first three games, two really good teams, a lot of talent, a lot of fight. We don't expect any of this to be easy, nor do they. And that's the way it should be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"So yeah, I don't buy into the whole big-time favorites. That's from your perspective, not from ours."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, you go back to that third year when we lost to Minnesota in game 82, which was, in essence, the play-in tournament before the play-in tournament was put into play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"The thing that jumped out, we lost that game in overtime, but Nikola and Jamal, a third-year player, a second-year player, they were out there playing at a high level. That showed me and that showed our front office and, more importantly, I can remember Josh Kroenke coming up to me after that game and being excited about what the future held because of how well those guys played with the stakes that were obviously going on during that game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that was really early on, but even prior to that, Jamal, Nikola showed that they had a chance to become what they are today. I'm just thankful that we as an organization have given that the time that is required to get to this stage. Most places, that does not happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Zero discussion about making any changes. Again, Michael Porter is a big part of our team. We would not be in this position if it wasn't for him. We are not just Nikola and Jamal. We are a basketball team, and Michael being a big part of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"As far as him kind of getting back into his groove, I talked to him today about understanding that we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for all the contributions and growth that you've shown us throughout this year being healthy. Go out there and play, be aggressive, shoot the ball with confidence and, remember, you're not a specialist. We don't bring in specialists. Those are guys that are not suited for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"We want guys that if you're not making shots, you're doing something else to help your team running the floor, rebounding, contesting, whatever it may be. Michael has that within him. I have no doubt that -- and I mean this I have zero doubt in my mind that Michael Porter is going to have a big game and help us win a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,We have a terrific coaching staff. I'm really fortunate to have the guys on my staff.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"But at the same time, I think you have to give credit where credit is due. Nikola is just a different player. From day one, what stood out to me was the skill level, the ball handling, the ball passing, the soft touch. He is a guy that works on his craft. He not just a guy that shows up and does that. The amount of time that he puts into his game I don't think is documented enough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, Nikola is gifted with his IQ, his intelligence, his vision, but as you also point out, his ability to finish around the basket with a variety of shots with both hands."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think all the players in that locker room look at him, and especially when we hit adversity, and he is always calm. I think he has a great way about him. Never gets too high, never gets too low and really just kind of stays the course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"For him, like he'll tell you, it is basketball. It's not life-and-death. Keeping it in perspective. But with that being said, at this stage, we understand that we have a chance to do something special, and he leads that charge. I think just his calmness when things are roughest really kind of settles down the guys around him, because they look to him for his words but also his body language and his positivity. That does a lot for our group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys stepped up. We were up 13 going into the fourth quarter, they start off 8-O and that coincides with Nikola picking up his fifth foul. So they came out aggressively. They have us on our heels, and usually in the regular season when Nikola went out, things kind of went haywire."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I can say not just tonight but throughout these Playoffs, however many games we've played now, the non-Nikola minutes have gone really well. We called a timeout, we ran a play, ATO, Jamal knocks it down. Really well executed. The unit that was out there, Jamal, Bruce, Jeff, Aaron, and then KCP or Christian, they defended. The fourth quarter we held that team to 22 points, 39 from the field. We outscored them the second half 53-44."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"And then Bruce Brown in the fourth quarter was amazing. He had I think 21 points, 11 of those were in the fourth quarter. They were giving Jamal so much attention that let's get Jamal off the ball, let Bruce make some plays. He was aggressive, got to the basket, made shots, and tonight was an impressive performance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought Aaron Gordon was huge all night long. He brought his hardhat tonight and was just a warrior on both ends for us. Nikola, he had another great game. And one of the best stats of the night was Jamal Murray had 12 assists, no turnovers. In a game where he was getting blitzed and bodies thrown at him all night long, did not have one turnover, and that's just remarkable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Truly a team win. We're not satisfied. We're going home. We know we have a lot of work to do, and we're going to take it one quarter at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, to your points, 27 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, making threes, getting to the foul line, guarding at a high level. Aaron did it all for us tonight. He really did. We've seen that now in four games in the Finals where Aaron has had moments where he has carried us offensively. He made threes tonight, obviously, which is always a good thing, but I couldn't be more proud of Aaron Gordon and his impact across the board tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, just understand that we haven't done anything. I told our guys, the first thing I said, we're not celebrating. It's a good win. We've done our job. But we're not celebrating like we've done anything yet. We know we're going to have to go home and turn off the TV, the radio, don't read the papers, don't listen to everybody telling you how great you are because we haven't done a damn thing yet. We have to win another game to be World Champions, and we're going to do that by simply taking it one quarter at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"We stay true to our identity, we'll give ourselves a great chance to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think Jamal regardless of what's going on, he's going to step up. He's going to find a way to impact the game, and the most impressive thing for me was he had 15 points tonight, and he was 5-of-17 from the field. But 12 assists and zero turnovers, and just kind of, all right, they're putting two on me, let me make the right play. He did not get bored with making the right play. He did not say, I'm going to save us and try to carry the team. He just read the defense, made the right play, and trusted. That's a big part of our culture is trusting one another."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought Jamal's trusting his teammates tonight was just at such a high level. I'm really proud of his performance, and again, it wasn't just Nikola and Jamal. We're getting really, really big contributions from a lot of players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I'll say, I think that's two games in a row, and even the first game that we won, our defense has been playing at a high level. I've got to give our guys so much credit for being locked in, being disciplined. That's three wins now where our defense has held them under 100 points, and the three-point line once again was a huge part of that. Only eight made threes for them tonight, and our guys are locked in. We're focused."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I can't speak for Joker. What I do know is this This is four rounds now, Minnesota, Phoenix, Lakers, and now Miami, where our bench overall has done a really nice job. You know all season long, it was like oh, the non-Nikola minutes, kind of a crapshoot. You're watching the game like this sometimes shielding eyes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"The Playoffs, our guys have -- we cut our rotation down. We're limiting who we're playing. But the guys that are out there, they're competing, and they're defending. Maybe our offense may not be as beautiful as it is with Nikola, but the five guys that are out there are defending, and that's the key to that group playing well and being able to get back in the game after they started with an 8-0 run themselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys stepped up, and got to give a huge shout-out to the 18,000 fans at Ball Arena tonight. I remember when I first got to Denver, we couldn't get 18,000 people in that building when we were there, and the fact that there's 18,000 people at Ball Arena tonight supporting this team, a lot of love for those fans. Appreciate the support."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Can I say that I envisioned him scoring 11 points in the fourth quarter on the road in Game 4 of the Finals? I can't say that. But I did envision him being a ball handler, a playmaker. I watched him for the years that I've coached against him, I watched him in the playoff last year against Boston, saw his impact of guarding guys like Tatum and Brown, but his ability to facilitate, play with the ball, play off the ball, make shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"And the one thing I know about Bruce, I know he went to college down here, but he's not afraid. We got a lot of guys that have a quiet toughness about them, and Bruce Brown is definitely one that embodies that Boston toughness that he brings to the table every night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, and Billy Kennedy was at one of those games, so he was laughing at me. We looked at each other like, not again. Thankfully it wasn't a long delay."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think right after that, I hope the woman is okay. I think they wheeled a lady out tonight, so I hope she's -- I'm not sure what happened there. Hopefully it wasn't a Nuggets fan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"As far as Nikola and the ankle, he's tough, and I could tell that he was fine. He just had to kind of keep it loose and don't allow it to get stiff. But he's resilient, and he's tough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"I thought it was there. At the end of the day, they just made more plays than we did. Brown had a huge impact on the game, Gordon as well. We felt getting Jokic in foul trouble was to our advantage, but we just couldnt get over the top."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"We gave ourselves a chance. We got within striking distance. But on both sides of the ball, they just made more plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"They are a very good team. They are here for a reason. They have a number of guys on the team that can play both sides of the ball, make big impacts. It was Braun last game. They had a couple guys this game who hit shots. Even Green hit that shot in the corner."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,Just a number of guys making good plays on that side as well as on the defensive side. We just have to regroup and try to push the series back here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"Just like we say here, stay in the saddle. We know that anything can happen. Has been done before. In a Conference Final and Final, I have been part of it before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"You really just have to take it one possession at a time. Forget the game. Its just one possession, one quarter, half to half. Just get it done by any means necessary and figure the rest out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't know what I was saying. Probably to get us in some action, just don't have empty possession. To be honest, I don't even remember what I was yelling. In the moment of the game, probably I saw something that I don't know now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, it's still one win. We need to win one more. I like that we didn't relax. We didn't get comfortable. We were still desperate. We still want it. That's what makes me happy, that guys didn't relax."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I'm just happy that every year we've grown as a team and every year we were getting better, and now we are in this situation. We will stick to the guys that we draft or whatever, and of course we add some really good players that accept our culture or our style of play, and I think that's why we are in this situation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, my journey is -- I don't think it's that interesting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course. I think that's where you see the growth, and like you said, maturity in his game. I think he was amazing today. Yes, of course he was shooting 5-for-17. Of course, some nights you miss, some nights you make. But he's our leader, and we are following him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not a big -- 23, 12 and 4? Fourth ever to 23, 10 and 4? I mean, I don't know. Nice. It's good. I really don't know what to say."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, we believe in each other and that's the most important thing. Like I said, we didn't relax, and that's what I liked the most."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That team did something amazing, and we know that they are capable for making history. We respect them. I respect them a lot. We as a group are going to give them the respect that they deserve, and we're going to play -- like the first game of the series, it's a must-win for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes. Actually he texted me, for real. Yes, he texted me. For real. He didn't lie. Yes, he's amazing, of course, in his sport and he's making history every time. Probably he's going to go as one of the best ever, if not the best ever. He has a nice opportunity to win another one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's just an amazing sport and having him as a countryman that he represents us in the world, I think it's a great honor, and I think the people of Serbia are really happy that we have him as our countryman."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't think so that he went to Belgrade, to be honest. I think he stayed in Miami. Maybe he likes Miami more. Yes, he's my good friend, a good friend, and I'm happy that -- last game was Vucevic, too. So I have a couple friends in the stands."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Maybe Mike can answer this question, not me. You know, he's playing a different role, and that's why he sacrificed himself and that's why he's a great teammate, and that's why he won us the game today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think if you sacrifice yourself for something bigger than yourself, the team, whatever, he sacrifices himself, and that's why I think the one upstairs gave him the game today, gave him the game that he had. He was our best player on the floor, and guarding the best player every night, that's a tough job, and maybe he's not going to get a lot of credit, but we know what he's doing for our team, and we're really thankful for him and we appreciate him a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course. He had an amazing night, and he was really aggressive in the fourth quarter, and that's what -- him and Aaron were really, really good. They were amazing. When he did a step-back three, I almost -- I wanted to punch him, but when he made it, I was so happy. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's the same as Aaron he's learning, and he is accepting, and that's what the best thing is about him. He was really good tonight, aggressive, attacking, and not being scared of the moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I've always said I believe in my teammates, and Aaron was the best player probably in his team back in Orlando or one of the best. He had a completely different role. Like I said, he sacrificed himself. That's telling a lot about him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"As long as we win, I'm good, whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I mean, in the Playoffs you start winning when you're winning on the road. That's what DJ and Jeff has told us, and they are right. Of course every round we won on the road, and I think that's stunning about us, too. We are not scared of the moment. We believe in each other, and especially on the road you need to trust each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"The only way is together, and that's how we won the games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I think I'm playing the same way basketball. Maybe experience, maybe knowing. I really don't know. I mean, I'm playing the same way basketball the last 15 years probably. Maybe I'm shooting more, maybe I'm scoring more maybe. But I think in a global -- I think ""experience"" is the word probably."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, most definitely. Joker is such an incredible passer, such a floor general out there. He has such a high IQ and such a basketball knowledge for the game. He sees plays steps ahead. So he's reading the defense before he even catches the ball or he's reading the defense before the play is even initiated."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I'm just playing in that dunker, and it's putting that low man in a difficult position. Do you step up? He has such a lethal floater in the middle of the lane, that do you try and take away the floater or do you try and take away the lob. If you take away the lob, you've got shooters in the corner. You've got KP and MPJ. So it's putting the defense in a pickle. Jok just makes the right play every time, and that's how it's been from the start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I mean, that's just how this team is built. We have guys that can step up night in and night out. Sometimes it's not going to be your night, and sometimes it is going to be your night. This team does a good job finding the people that are kind of in a rhythm and kind of going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Just to keep shooting. Try not to force it but to continue to shoot your shot. But Mike is a great player, and he's going to find ways to involve himself in the game, so he did a good job attacking the basket and finding cuts and making plays all over the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,I'm not worried about Mike. Mike is going to make shots as long as he keeps shooting. So that's all we're doing is just encouraging him to shoot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"As far as making shots, I'm just taking the ones that they're giving me, taking the open ones."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"No, not really. It's just gamesmanship. That's part of the game. When you make a three in the corner with the opposition's bench, you can have a little fun with them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I mean, that's the MO. That's the MO. Just throw it up, I'll go get it, anywhere around it. They're making really good passes, really smart plays and putting the ball on the money, making it easy for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, we have counters and counters to our counters. If Mal is being overplayed or working too hard, I can kind of offload some of that ball-handling responsibility and kind of get him some ones, some easy looks within the rhythm of the offense. So he's not having to work so hard, having to bring the ball up 94 feet, be guarded and then doubled."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Just trying to make it easier for him, having him play a little bit off the ball. Yeah, so he's not working so hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"The difference between -- I mean, we always want to get stops and get out and run. I don't think we try and do anything too differently. We don't post as much. We play more five out, more pick-and-roll when Jokic is out. I think that's probably the majority of it. When Joker is in the game, we're going to go through him in the post."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Even when he's in the game, we still run the chase action, we still run high pick-and-roll action, and we do that when Jok is not in the game. It's more on the defensive end. We're able to switch 1 through 5, hopefully get stops and then get out and run. Our defense is our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"We take a lot of pride in it. We know we have a very potent, high-powered offense, and offensive players with Joker, Jamal, Mike, KCP, Brucy B. Going down the list, we have guys that can put the ball in a bucket in a multitude of ways. So we know what's going to win us games is defense, and we've got guys that love to play defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Joker doesn't get enough credit for his defense. He's spectacular with his hands and with his coverage, and KCP is the same way. Incredible just ball awareness, understanding where to be and how to strip down. It's awesome out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Well, it's pretty good, right? So far, so good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I felt like I was going to be a defender for this team, a defenseman for this team. I knew they could score. MPJ, one of the best shooters on earth. You've got a two-time MVP in Joker that can do everything on offense. You've got Jamal Murray that can go for 50 on any given night. I knew I was coming in to play defense and make their job easy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"That's what I like to do. I like to play defense. That's my niche. That's how I came into the league, defensive-minded."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"As far as the offensive side, it was just get in where I fit in, find cuts, find openings, find transition buckets, try and get easy ones, and then just -- really just get in where I fit in. That was really it. I really liked it, man. It was one of the teams where defenses were just like -- they have to pay attention to so much out there that I was kind of like able to cut unnoticed sometimes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"It's really rare. It's a blessing. It's awesome to play with these guys. These guys are so unselfish. They're so passionate about basketball, and they understand that you've got to keep energy in the ball, and if you play the right way, everything will work out the way it's supposed to. We can win. Everybody gets love when you win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, it was nice just knowing that I could be myself, and that was enough. I didn't have to be any more or any less. Yeah, that was cool. I get to just do what the team asks of me, and sometimes it's score, sometimes it's rebound, sometimes it's defend the best player, sometimes it's make plays. It could be something different on any given night, but every night I get to just be myself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Well, it's been fun. It's been a very -- it's been a learning experience. Now I get to learn with a great coaching staff, with great players around me, through a great organization. I've been able to pick it up pretty quickly, but I've always been a versatile player. I've always hung my hat on versatility and being able to do whatever it takes to win, regardless of what it may be, and it's just nice having a team like this and having a coaching staff like this that believes in you and trusts in your work."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I think we do. Especially when we've got like MPJ cutting, they're expecting him just to be out spotting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I feel like we have a counter for pretty much everything. When we're clicking, we're gelling offensively and defensively, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Well, he was just telling me to help Jamal out because Jamal was getting blitzed for the pick-and-roll. He just told me just don't leave him stranded, flash when he gets blitzed. They're smart, really smart. We were able to kind of alleviate some of the pressure on Mal a little bit, but for the most part Jamal was making the right play every time. He's so unselfish. He was a point God today. He had 12 assists, no turnovers. He didn't fight it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"He could have. He could have tried and forced it, but he didn't. He played the right way. He took what the game was giving him. Man, he really played a great game because they were trying whatever they could to stop him, trying to do whatever they could to stop him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It was great. We wanted to come in and try to not only get one game, but get both of them. And we did exactly what we wanted to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Game plan was just to communicate, make sure we get to the right spots down the stretch. Game 3, we knew we had a lot of slippages, and tonight we wanted to correct them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I felt we would have still come out with the W the way we were playing throughout the game. But Bruce was amazing, getting to the rack, pull-up three, an and-one and also knocking down those free throws. He was big for us making those points in the fourth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Oh, yes. I always tell AG, man, continue to play his game. When youre shooting threes, no up, no in, so make sure you get that ball up so it can go in. He did that tonight. We were so proud of him to continue to be confident and shoot the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We're excited, but the jobs not done. Weve got one more. Were just going to take it back home and try to close it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just the excitement. Like you said, coming into the locker room knowing we're up 3-1. Here we can enjoy the moment. But weve got one more to get back in Denver."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"Same thing it's always been, it's one game at a time. Now we are in a must-win situation every single game, which we're capable of. Some correctible things we've got to do, but it's not impossible. We've got to go out there and do it. We've got three to get."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we were up a little higher, trying to make sure that we showed bodies on there coming off the pick-and-roll. A couple of their cuts were kind of, you know, just random and kind of just landed in their lap."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"But, you know, I think we just got to find a way to kind of keep the ball in front of us. It happened tonight. They got good cuts tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"No doubt. We don't have any of that. We don't have no quit. We are going to continually fight, starting tomorrow, to get better. And then we are going into Monday and do what we said we were going to do this entire time and win. We have to. We have no other choice. Otherwise, we did all this for no reason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,The guys know. We know. We've got something to do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,It's always a make-or-miss game. It's a make-or-miss league. I missed some shots. That's just part of it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I don't think missing shots for our team will ever make us win or lose a game. I think we had some lapses, and not getting back the cuts to offensive rebounds, those are the areas that we can control that we do have to fix. Whether I'm missing shots or somebody else is missing shots, those are the areas we have to be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think so. I think we really do believe in one another and ourselves as individuals. We've done some hard things all year long in this playoff run as well, and now it's like the hardest of the hard. But like we always say, you know, the things that you want is on the other side of hard is, I don't know what."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"So that's where we're at. That's our reality, so we've got to go out and win three straight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, I won't do it. I got too much faith in my guys. Their shots will fall. They have been the reason behind us winning so many games, and I'm not letting that faith in them waver. I won't do it. I'm going to continue to play basketball the right way, pump confidence in those guys, and we are going to always live with the result."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"Go ahead, Kyle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we understand we have to thrive and we've got to win. I think it heightens our intensity. You know, I think it's win-or-go-home right now, and our intensity has been really high, but when you get into these situations, you have to really be focused on every second, literally every second."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"I think just be ready to play. Gabe's been unbelievable this whole playoff run, this last couple months. Gabe is a tremendous basketball player. Our league is a make-or-miss league, and you have a guy in Jimmy Butler who is going to continue to pump confidence into him. I'm going to pump confidence into him. He's going to come out and have a great game in Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"We are all going to get some rest, recover, and get on that plane tomorrow with the mission in mind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it's been great. It just shows the work I've put in each offseason. Remember, when I first came in the league, I couldn't shoot. I wasn't confident shooting the ball at all. I was a mutt guy. They left me wide open and let me shoot. So that took a toll on my confidence, but it put a chip on my shoulder."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"So I just got in the gym and worked, and now it's showing on the biggest stage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, AG was being extremely aggressive. They were switching a smaller defender on him or in transition he had a smaller defender on him. Every time we want him to be aggressive. He will make plays for us. He'll make the right play every time, and tonight was his time to score, and he was hitting threes, so that was huge for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, so I'd seen -- I was just reading the defense. Jimmy's strength, strong side corner, so if I drove, it was going to be a tough shot. The shot clock was already low."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"But yeah, that's been my go-to move if I want a shot off the dribble my whole life. Once I seen him back up a little bit, I went for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, they shoot the ball extremely well, especially Duncan, Strus, Gabe, K-Love and Caleb. So really just try to fan out when Jimmy is under the basket but still give help. But yeah, try to get them off the line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, if they're going to send two to Jamal and then leave Jok open in the pocket, somebody has to step up. So basically it's a 3-on-2. So someone is going to be open. Usually since we have great shooters on this team, it's someone under the basket. So we just try to capitalize."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"I would say -- they kept going on runs to end the quarters. They were playing extremely well at the end of the quarters, so we had to fix that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it's great. I don't know if it's happened before or maybe it has. But it's great. We were focused. We were locked in. They won one on our floor, so now we've got to be focused for Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, we've just been extremely focused in practice, walk-throughs, shootarounds. Everybody has been locked in, going kind of game speed, just going through their plays. So we knew exactly what we needed to do, and we locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, not a lot of time but we've played without Jok. He sat out a few games earlier in the year, and then we knew they were going to try to get the ball out of Jamal's hands. For me, I knew it was my time to be aggressive and try to make plays, get to the rim. And if I don't have a shot, find my teammate."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"No. I'm not thinking about it too much. I know coming into the league what I could do. It was just a team had to give me a chance, and Dwane Casey did. I started my rookie year, did very well. So I thank him for that, but now doing it on this stage, it's amazing. I'll think about it when we're done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,Our whole season hasn't been easy. We just seem like we just -- we won't quit. And I feel like that's what he means. We just will not quit.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Spo definitely made it an emphasis to attack the rim, to really get to the rim, me and Jimmy, everybody included, really get downhill and make things happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"For them -- where is it? perusing stats. I feel like they got a lot of rim attacks off of minor mistakes, lack of communication and certain skirmishes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Keep going. That's the biggest thing for me. Keep forcing that, keep getting to the line, see the ball go in and live with the result."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"That's how you do it. You take it one game at a time. We've seen a team come back from 3-0 firsthand. So we just have to believe, and one game at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Amongst us? A lot of people pissed off. But biggest thing is, first to four. That's the biggest thing, first to four. We take it one game at a time and we figure this thing out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like the first thing is getting downhill, and then you live with those results. If our shooters are open, kick it out to our shooters and then make shots. Then get back on defense and make them take tough shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Watch film. Figure it out. It's a lot of stuff going on in the game. They got a lot of responsibility, and I'm proud of them taking it to the chin. They are going to keep fighting and they are going to keep trying to figure it out, and I believe in them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Obviously having those turnovers can't help us win. Biggest thing for me is watch film, figure out how can I be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Not really. That's pretty much their system, the way they guard. They usually pull guys into the paint, make things difficult. They're a really good team for a reason. They force you to play a certain way. We just got to be a little more intentional."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,I'd say the message is pretty similar. We're not going to get too high or too low. Things are going to be difficult. We just got to continue to stay the course.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I'd say so, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I wasn't really surprised. I think I heard whispers about it a couple years ago, a few years ago. You hear a lot of things. Often, they don't always come to fruition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think it was a great move on his part. From what I saw about the deal, it looks like it was a no-brainer deal, decision to make. I'm happy for him and his family. Hopefully they bring some good soccer to Inter Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I mean, Jokic is a pretty good screener. He typically makes contact with the primary defender pretty well. Jamal can score in a number of ways. He puts pressure on guys immensely."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,They're a dynamic duo. We got to bring our best effort.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I feel like it's the first team to get four wins. Whether we're behind or tied or ahead, we're going to stay pretty even-keeled and keep that in mind. It's the first team to four. That's all that matters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think either one could work. What we did could work, if we followed our game plan a little bit. I think we strayed. We lost our focus a bit on what we could be better on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Like you mentioned, they picked up their effort. They were good defensively, solid offensively. They're a very good team and they're going to force us to play well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,We're looking forward to the competition in Game 4.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,"To be honest, I don't really watch it that much. I don't know a lot about soccer. I know who Messi is. Pretty cool to have him in our city. Can't wait to meet him, if he comes to a game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,I don't know. I think we got good looks again. But it wasn't about shooting. It was everything else. They just beat us in every aspect of the game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,"They just beat us in every aspect. Loose balls, rebounds. They just out-played us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,"Some good sleep, rest. Been doing this all year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's been fun developing a relationship with him. We were fortunate enough to be able to spend a whole afternoon during training camp, see how they operate. Then in the afternoon, we ended up just talking shop. That's fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Obviously, he has been to a lot of our games. We've been texting back and forth. We share very similar thoughts about finding strength in adversity and using those as lessons to help you grow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, this is just part of the process. You have to go through stages. First part of it was just shooting, then movement, then contact versus coaches and then the next level of contact in practice. He has not been cleared for a game, and he is still not cleared yet."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, like a lot of these games, there are certain things that you like, and you think that you can continue to do those things. I liked our aggressive attacking mentality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Then there are things that we feel like we have to do better. This is great competition. Those two guys can manipulate your defense in different ways.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"One of the biggest strengths we have is our competitive spirit, nature, just to overcome whatever, even if players play well or a team plays well, that we figure out how to get the win at the end. We were not able to do that. You do have to credit them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Like I said after the game, the film also substantiated that, those areas, ball in the air, ball on the floor, 5050 balls, the physicality parts of the game, for the most part they are winning those. Clearly the rebounding differential was probably the most glaring sign."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"His spirits are great because he is able to work out. Where he was five weeks ago, he wasn't able to shoot and do things that he wanted to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,But he is a competitor. He wants to be out there. He was really excited at the beginning of this playoff run for the opportunity that we felt that we had with this team. But there's sometimes things that you can't control.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Right now he is not cleared to take that next step. He has checked every box so far, but he is not at that next step yet to clear for an NBA Finals game. But he is doing everything he needs to do to take these next steps."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, whatever you do, you just can't do it all the time. There's no absolutes when you get to this level. It's the highest level of competition. You're getting the highest level of execution. Understanding what they're trying to get to, and we try to get them out of their comfort zones as much as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The first half, they really got to that two-man action quite a bit. They were getting a lot of traction, so they didn't need to go to any other part of their playbook. Second half, we did a little bit better with it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Game 4 could be different. They may go to a different part of their menu. Whatever it is, we have to find a way to get the job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know if he'll be on the report because I don't follow that. I think if you have a hangnail, you have to put that on the report. He slipped at the end. But he already did his shooting and his workout, so he is fine. He'll be ready to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,All the experiences are different. You want to be fully present for the team and what is happening right now.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I've said this during this playoff run The more experience you have, the more perspective you have about how difficult this really is. These are extremely difficult challenges. You end up being even more grateful for the opportunities to compete at the highest level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,That's what we all want. This is the stage that you want to be able to compete and have everything decided between those four lines and find out how your team stacks up.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But it is tough. It's tough going through the gauntlet of three rounds to get to this level. Then when you get to this level, it should be what it is. It's the highest level of competition. Our guys thrive in that. They love it. Even after games like last night, our guys love to compete and put it all out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, there was a couple of those, but also the force he was playing with on cuts and drives and in transition. Those were X-factor points, for sure. Now he has had two games where he has been able to have an impact. Throughout the rotation, we have to make sure that we're getting positive minutes and winning more skirmishes than not. Last night, we lost the majority of those skirmishes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, obviously give a lot of credit to them, but I think also just raising our level, sense of urgency, and just attention to detail and focus and just overall commitment to the overall goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"We've already met and talked about it, and we feel good about it moving forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, you kind of said it. This is a game and situation where the urgency should be and will be at an all-time high, especially on this stage, especially here with being down now 2-1. It's a great opportunity for us, and I think we're all just ready to wrap our minds around it and pour everything we have into it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Oh, I mean, that's not something you just turn on once the Finals come. I think all of us, we've been talking about this for a while, especially with -- first off, the guys that have played in this city for multiple years, myself included, but then also really the last month and a half of the year, regular season for us, we were treating them all like playoff games because they were, given where we were in the standings."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"We have a lot of practice with kind of editing our lives and really locking in on what's most important. Obviously when you make it to the Finals everybody gets a text from all the people, Hey, can I come visit you, this, that and the other, and you've really got to delineate between the people that are going to breathe life into you, because you want to have some people around and share it with them because that's what this is about, but at the same time, be able to build that barrier and also spend time and be selfish about putting everything you have into this effort that we have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I mean, yeah, obviously a beautiful city. One of my favorite things is just how international it is, the different cultural influences, and that shows in terms of food and different experiences, like all that sort of stuff. Really enjoy that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And I'm a pretty active person, so I like to get out, play other sports, mix it up, tennis, golf, get out on the water if I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, all that's for the offseason. We're not thinking about that right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, you know, I think it's a group effort. Good offense is a function of just being connected as a group. We've had stretches where we've been really, really good, and we expect to get back to that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"For us as individuals, it's just about being persistent and continuing to be aggressive and confident and hunting for our shots, and when they present themselves, take advantage of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I think it goes both ways. I think we just developed a relationship of trust on the court where he understands what I'm trying to get to, and during rehab, just always reassuring me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Not just rehab but even during games if I'm not shooting well, just always reassuring me and keeping me positive, looking on the bright side and not letting me get into my own head sometimes about what's going on in the midst of the games or the midst of rehabs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,He has always helped me out and kept me in a positive mood or done enough to reassure me. So I appreciate that a lot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, the best word is free flowing. If something is not there, we don't go to it. If it's there, we go to it. If we plan on doing something and they do something different, we adjust on the fly. We call a lot of audibles. Each possession we're talking about what they just did, how we can counter it. There's so many different counters that we can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"We don't fight it. I think that's the biggest thing. Whatever we're doing, whatever the defense is doing, we're not fighting it. We're just reacting and playing and flowing right into our offense and not being stagnant."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a lot of fun to play like that, being unselfish and just make reads."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"He was trying to make subs but I was at the free-throw line, so I kind of had to stay in. Yeah, like I said, it's a cool stat. Just want to win a championship. Just trying to win a game. It's not really worth something looking into or playing for. Just trying to win a game and doing everything I can to impact it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. We just go into every game trying to win. We try to win every game. Home or away, try to win every game. We don't plan on losing a game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Whether we're home or away, we're trying to win. Just kind of react off that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Takes the biggest guy out of the paint. You have to guard him. He can obviously shoot it. I think he just does a good job of just picking his spots, pump faking, getting to the lane or shooting an open three, even shooting a contested one just to keep them honest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,That opens things up not just for us for but for him as well. Opens up his moves and his drives and his passing and all that. He is going to continue to play the game and do a good job of picking his spots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, just a love for the game and trying to accomplish something. We both got our mind on winning, and however it takes -- we always say it might not be your night, but if you can set a good screen, if you can play good defense, get a rebound, if you can hustle, if you can make a timely pass or a shot or whatever it is, that's what we're trying to accomplish."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Sometimes it may not be one of our nights, but we can both impact the game and winning. I think that's where the root of it stems from, is just having a common goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, just making it look easy, slowing the game down. Whether the double team is coming from the bottom or the middle, single coverage to an assign, it doesn't matter. He'll figure it out. We'll all adjust to give him the right spacing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,He has been doing it. He is a two-time MVP. He has been doing it for a while where they're not just having one guy on him. To be able to pick teams apart with his passing and scoring and timely passing is really tough to stop.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"We know. As a group, we know what we can do on defense. We're just trying to change the narrative that he doesn't play defense. He's got amazing hands, timing, IQ, rebounding ability, body position, rule of vert. He's got all that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,Sometimes it's not about how high you can jump and what kind of shots you can block. It's about body position and where you are on the court. That's half the job right there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"He is an elite defender in the pick-and-roll. For what he lacks, he makes up for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think the biggest thing about that is just giving them one shot. They've got a lot of scorers and shooters over there, so we can't keep giving them multiple looks, multiple chances. Even when we do play good defense, it's very deflating to watch them get a rebound and get another chance at it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a collective effort on the board. Like I said, all coming from the elbows and chip in, Jokic battling down there every night and then you've got Mike and AG, normally the second- and third-biggest guys out there cleaning stuff up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Sometimes it may not be your rebound, but as long as one of us gets it, the job is done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"He is strong. He is strong. He is seven-foot. He's got amazing touch, IQ, passing. He does a great job of just picking his spots, when to go right away, when to wait for the double, when to put the ball on the floor, when to spin. Yeah, he is a tough cover down there. He is up there with the greats."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,I think it's both. Sometimes I'll ask assistant equipment manager Gene Marquez what color jerseys we're wearing so that helps me envision what I'm trying to portray in my head. Just a little trick where it's a little easier for me to kind of imagine the energy I want to bring in the uniform I'm in.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"I also envision like reactions. Like, if I miss a shot, what is the first thing I'm thinking about like, damn, that was a good shot or just next shot or just get back or don't worry about it or am I homing in on it too long. Little stuff like that, just kind of redefining my mentality within the game so when it happens I'm almost prepared for it and able to adjust that way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a lot of fun. A lot of fun. We're all having fun. Trying to solve this puzzle together. Like I said, we've all been dreaming about getting to this stage. We have vets in the league that haven't made it this far in their 15, 16 years of playing. So we don't want to take this opportunity for granted, knowing that this is not an everyday thing. It takes a lot of work to be here, a lot of years of dedication. We just want to make the most of it for everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"We've just got to go back to the drawing board, figure out what we did, all the mistakes and just come with a new and better effort, especially at home. Try to take advantage of the games we can, and just have more of a will to get it done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, just attention to detail, controlling the things that we can control and sticking to the game plan, no matter how the game is going. Just doing what we do, not getting caught up in what those guys are doing making tough shots. We've got to continue to do the things that put us in this position."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think that they were just applying pressure on the boards. It seemed like every time they missed a shot, somebody else was there. We've got to do a better job of getting those guys off the glass and doing our work early."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, they came in with that edge, knowing that they were going on the road. It was going to be a hostile environment. So kind of similar to us in Game 2 on the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think it took just staying with it, just being confident and just understanding that those opportunities, those moments will come. Just preparing yourself mentally and physically for those opportunities to take advantage of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I think that has been the biggest thing so far. Obviously a ton of help and a ton of credit to my vets and my coaches and stuff to put me in this position and getting me mentally prepared. But yeah, just staying ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"He has meant everything to me. He is on the Mount Rushmore of undrafted guys who have made a living in this league. I'm so fortunate to have someone like him, to be under his wing and take advice from him and just learn from him. It's been an honor, for sure, to be around him and to be able to learn from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,I've had a big-time luxury of having him on the team and being a part of this run.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,We need to be as desperate as we've ever been to get these next three. It's going to be tough. We've just got to want it more than those guys.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"We also love the fact that we're competing against a team like that just because it's going to bring the best out of you, and we're bringing the best out of them. So this is what you play for. You don't get to this point without playing your best ball. You've got to also love and appreciate the level of competition, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"It means everything. You have guys like that continue to make the right plays whether you're making or missing, just having that confidence knowing that the shooters are going to continue to get good looks and they're going to eventually fall."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I've got to do a better job of knocking down shots and being more confident, not passing up shots, because when our shooters are shooting with confidence, good things will typically happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"Just not going anywhere. That's how I view it. There will be a time and place to take advantage of those type of things and have fun when you can. You've also got to get away and do things and find ways to keep your mind sane and fresh, especially being in a position like this. But it's not going anywhere. There will be a time and place for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I just love to be outside. I'm a big fisherman, so I'm trying to find some spots. Y'all got any recommendations, put me on y'all's spots. Other than that, right now I just like to chill, get some sun and get back in the gym."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, as I watched the film, as we watched it as a staff and then with the team, there was nothing about the historical night that it was. We're addressing all the areas where we have to be better. Too many turnovers, too many offensive rebounds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"And so, yeah, it was nothing celebrating the great nights that Nikola and Jamal had more importantly, it's about how can we find a way to come out tomorrow night and get another one here in Miami heading home to Denver for Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think it was evident from early on in his career in Denver, is that really high IQ, sees things before they happen, a step ahead of most people. What you love about him is offensively, no matter what is thrown at him, he has an answer. He has seen everything in his eight years that you could conceivably come up with as a defensive game plan. He doesn't fight it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's one thing I love about Nikola He takes what the game brings. That's what makes him special. He is able to make everyone around him better. He is able to read the game plan, read the floor, read the defense and make the right play seemingly every time. There's not many players that are that heady, especially doing it at the stage that he is doing it on right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,It's really a luxury to have a player that is not only as talented as he is but unselfish and with the IQ that he has.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Very happy with the defensive effort. You look at the numbers across the board, and our guys were so much more locked in, so much more urgent and aggressive in Game 3 than we were in Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, I can't speak for any other coach, like when you lose a game, the first reaction isn't we have to change the game plan. For me, the first reaction is are we executing the game plan correctly. In Game 2, we didn't. That led to countless mistakes, which led to a lot of points for Miami where we could have been a lot better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Last night only 11 made threes. The defense was much better. The communication and discipline was much better. That is what I'm most proud about is the buy-in, commitment, urgency that we had. It will have to be even better tomorrow night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you go back to Game 1, they made 13 threes in that game. I think six were in the fourth quarter. For three quarters, we did a great job of guarding the three. Then that 21-point lead got knocked down to nine because we opened up the three-point line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Game 2 was 17, way too many. So I think a big message for our guys is we want them to try to beat us with tough twos and eliminate the threes as much as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,He is fine. Just a floor burn.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"When you look at Nikola, so many people just use an eye test to debate whether he is a good defender or not. That is just almost unjust, if you will, because you have to get past the eye test. You have to look at all the things that he does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"He has great awareness, great IQ, great anticipation, tremendous hands to break things up. They shot 34 percent in the restricted area last night. Nikola was a big part of that. Nikola contested 21 shots last night. He had two blocks. He is doing a lot for us to get to this stage in the Finals, and then for us to have a great defensive performance last night, his fingerprints were all over that game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, in my conversations with Jamal coming out of Game 2, going into Game 3, just reiterating to him how important he is to this group. Not just a 30-10-10 night, but more than that. He is a leader of this team, and not just vocally but emotionally."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"I felt in Game 2 he was there, but I just didn't feel him like I know I have felt him throughout these Playoffs. Being in the moment and feeling his energy, I think that is a big thing for me, reading somebody, seeing where are they at mentally, where are they at physically. Forget making and missing shots. But I could tell from early on in Game 3 last night that Jamal was fully present in the moment and was ready and willing and able to do whatever it took to lead this team to a big win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"From the opening tip to the final buzzer, I felt Jamal was just that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think so many people are quick to dismiss people. Michael Porter isn't making shots right now, and we know he is a great shooter. We know what he is capable of. But he had seven rebounds last night, and he had some really good defensive possessions and possessions in which he contested shots and was working on that end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"In this business, if you are just a specialist, we're not for you. We don't like specialists. We like basketball players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Michael Porter is not making shots. He has to find a way to help impact winning through being an unselfish player on offense, being a defensive-minded player, being somebody that rebounds the basketball. And his shot is going to fall."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"If he's taking the right shots and we're generating the right shots for him, I want him, I want KCP, two guys that we know are better than they showed in three games, they've got to keep shooting the ball because that is the only way they're going to get out of that slump."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,But we believe in Michael. He is our starting small forward. I have zero doubt he is going to have a very big game coming up here that is going to help us win this championship.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think it is critical. We have a great offense, period. But when Nikola is making threes, that puts so much more pressure on the opposing defense. I think he has one of the best shot fakes in the NBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"And for a big guy, he is great at attacking closeouts. If you're shooting 40-plus from three and now teams are really worried about that and they're running you off the line or closing to touch, he is shot faking or driving that closeout."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"And now you have a 6-10, 6-11 great passer getting downhill that is going to score. He is an uncanny finisher. He is going to find somebody working behind the defense for a lob, or he is going to kick it out and spray for a wide-open three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's not just the three points that he is making, but the pressure and the added layer he is putting against that defense. It's really fun to watch him pick, pop, shoot, oh, we've got to run him off the line, pick, pop, drive to closeout layup, spray or make a play for somebody else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"That is what defines him for me as a truly great player, every night his ability to make every one of his teammates better players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,Who would do something like that? Had to be Bam smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Honestly, we play basketball for a living. If you get too uptight -- that's been our group the whole year. We got great leaders. Jimmy is loose. Bam is loose. Coach, he's going to smile."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"If you get too uptight, you can wind yourself crazy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Yes, we've all thought about the game. We slept badly last night. I'm sure everyone did. We got to just stay in the moment. The moments don't come often. Seventeen years for me, I mean, it's my second Finals. I'm appreciative of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,I think our group is just a group that understands that it's how we are. We don't get uptight. We just go out there and we smile through everything. We just have fun.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Great. Fantastic. I could do 20,000 jumping jacks right now smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I think they made a great adjustment. That's Playoff basketball. Every single game is completely different. Adjustments will be made every single night. At this stage, two teams left, you got to be able to make adjustments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"That's what both teams have done throughout the Playoff run. It's really a chess match. They did a good job of staying home and making us shoot tough twos, stuff like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"But that's good basketball. It's good for them to be able to make that adjustment. Now we got to go and watch the film, figure out what we can do better, how we can adjust, how we can adapt, get some better looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Man, he's getting a lot of money laughter. It's going to be awesome, man. I think the MLS is a great league. I think they understand how to put the product out there. Bringing one of the world's greatest futbol players out there, bringing him here is going to be awesome. He's going to bring a different fan base. He's going to get some more revenue going. It's going to be a great atmosphere when they get that stadium built. The fans are going to enjoy it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it's great for soccer in America, especially down here in Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I'm a Messi fan. Soccer, I mean, it's great to watch. I watch the World Cups. I'm not good at it, so I don't really love it like that. If I was good at it, I'd be like ""yeah, yeah."""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,Not really.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I think every human being is different in general, right? So everyone is not going to be on the same page at all times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I think when you have one common goal, it's a lot easier. We watch the film, we'll be in there together. I think that's the one thing about it is that it's not as difficult."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,Yeah...
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,There you go.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"P5 started today. Y'all, go follow P5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"My all-time starting lineup of Villanova would be, got to go with Ed Pinckney for sure. I'm going to go with Tim Thomas. I'm going to go with Randy Foye. I'm going to go with me. I'm going to go with Mikal Bridges."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Then Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, they'll be my sixth and seventh man. I like that lineup. I'm happy with that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Listen, I ain't got nothing to do with that laughing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Honestly, that's a really good question. Honestly. I think through our athletics, I appreciate the guys who went through a lot of the struggles to even get us to this point where we can make decisions on where we want to be. It's about us being happy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, to be able to turn down one place and go to where you want to be, that's the ultimate goal. That's in life. That's in general, right? That's not just with athletics. That's life in general as a reporter, lawyer, doctor, you want to be able to choose where your happiness lies."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"At the end of the day, it's all about your health, health, happiness, family. That's all that matters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"You want to be able to say you're happy, you're smiling every single day, you're breathing above this earth while you can, and you can provide for your family, friends, for yourself, and be able to do it how you want to do it. That's the ultimate goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"We just have to come out and play better. We know our backs are against the wall. We feel if we play our game, stay true to our concepts, we're going to give ourselves a chance to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"They sent their bigs to the glass. Porter Jr. went to the glass, Gordon on both sides of the ball, then obviously Jokic with his 20-plus. That is tough to overcome when a team outrebounds you like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"As far as the deficit goes, I don't know if in a Finals game we've seen it quite like that before. We have to make that something that we're really focusing on, making sure we're checking bodies, getting in the paint, getting rebounds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,We've seen two really big teams in the first and second round that played traditional bigs at the four and five. Also bigger teams. This team definitely poses a threat and makes it tough on you from that perspective. So we have to do a better job.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"I think it's just that understanding what we're doing on both sides of the ball. Being intentional about our game plan. Understanding our concepts. Understanding what we're doing after timeouts, coming into the half, throughout the quarters, staying true to who we are."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"I think that's part of being intentional, as well, is understanding who we are, what we want to get done, doing things with intention. When that does happen, your impact is always going to work out for the better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"He is so creative. Keeps you on your heels in so many different ways because he can shoot it. I know from especially where the game has gone, fours and fives being really good shooters, the game going to a pace and space, that defending that is very tough. It poses a whole 'nother set of problems."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"It's such a luxury for them to have him being more than capable when he wants to be elite at shooting the ball from the perimeter. He puts the ball down on the floor, gets to his spots. If you're going to double, he picks you apart. He is, again, a special player from that perspective."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"Just who we are on an everyday basis. I think that is something that needs to and will come out tomorrow, is the high-character group that we have and our resiliency and our ability to respond. Those are the things that stick out to me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"I think we had a lot of shots at the rim that were tough, were contested, that we typically make. We'll finish those tomorrow. We'll go out and make an effort. We talked about that intention earlier. Make that very intentional getting to our spots. Playing free, playing a little bit more I guess fluid, if you will, be able to knock down those shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,I thought we had some contested ones on the offensive end that definitely could have dropped for us. We felt like we could have broken the paint and gotten some swing swings and hockey assists with those. Tomorrow we'll knock those down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"Stay in the saddle, stay the course. That's the biggest thing we can do. We have a game plan that is proven can work. Obviously, you guys have seen it all year with how good they have been and well-coached they have been, the Denver Nuggets. We feel like we have a game plan that if we stick true to it, understanding that the room for error is so small."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"If anybody is capable of it, we are. Continue to drill, continue to stay true to our concept, no slip-ups. If we do that, we feel we can give ourselves a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, a bunch of things, to be honest, but good question. Mike, take note Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Depends. If I feel my defender is down the floor, I can set a screen and hold it. If I see that they're going to blitz or show, I can slip out. Or if I see the defender is kind of late, I'm going to slip out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's just an in-moment decision, I think. Sometimes you make a good decision, sometimes you make a mistake. But just probably to change, have a more variable -- I forgot the word, but doesn't matter. Just to have different variation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,Random. Just don't give the same look every time.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, just aggressive movement. When he cuts and is aggressive, one defender is going to take him and that's going to open a lot of space. He was attacking downhill, which helps a lot just to go by the guy or just go aggressive. Yesterday he was amazing. But usually he does the same things. Sometimes he make, sometimes he miss. But generally he is playing really aggressive, and that's really helping us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, definitely it is because we have Jeff, we have Ish, we have DJ, who have been in the league a long time. Okay, Jeff one time was in the Finals. DJ played with a really good team, Ish played with a lot of good players, good teams, and they never made the Finals. It's maybe now or never. I think it's really important to be focused, to give us an opportunity or chance to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think I didn't affect them at all, to be honest. They are really good players. But yes, maybe just try to make him uncomfortable or taking the shot he doesn't want or take it over a contested hand or just to move his hand or move his shot a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,I think don't give an easy one. I think that's my main focus.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"No, I don't feel the same because I only talk about people telling me my stats and I'm trying to say it's a team basketball. I mean, yes, I feel the same way, my friend. I think it's how everything works. In Europe, it's a little bit maybe the team, the winning. Here it's winning, too, but maybe more stats. I don't know. I really don't know. Good question. Mike. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,I really didn't. I don't know.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't think I did. Maybe I did. I don't remember, to be honest. Maybe I said a little bit of something, but I don't remember what, to be honest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it's cool just to see different solutions, how different players think different and how some players are reacting a certain way, how certain players don't react. Especially now, like you remember, so they blitz us a couple times, they steal the ball, then we reacted good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's just kind of bringing a game, like a chess game. They are one move, we are another move. I think this is the time where the players show what they've got."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"For me, it's pretty easy. I just stay at the house. If I'm not playing basketball, working out, I got a daughter, so I spend a lot of time with her, family. I spend time with my family, focusing on what my goals is, not letting distractions to get to my head."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Sometimes I do get on the boat, a yacht, go in the water to get some fresh air, enjoy time out there with friends and family."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Other than that, maybe go to the playground with my daughter every now and then. That's about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,We rent a yacht.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, just me and my family."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, we just going to have to play more harder, play more together, play with more effort. It's a good team, so they're not going to give us anything easy. Everything is going to have to be fought for. We have to play with that same urgency and energy that we played with in Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,He's a good player. We're going to have to lock in on him. Him and Jokic's two-man game is a pretty hard action to stop.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"We got great defensive players, some of the great two-way players in this game, Jimmy and Bam. We're going to figure it out. We got a lot of different bodies with we can throw at Murray as well. We'll be ready for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, it's definitely fun. We have a great connection off the court, so it really translates well to on the court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Like you said, unselfish, we're very connected. It's kind of the same group we had last year. We're all familiar with each other. It's a pretty fun time for everybody being in the Finals. We still got three more wins to go, so we're excited about that and we're going to get that going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,That's a good question.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"Yeah. I mean, I can. Do I want to take credit for that? No. The dinner had nothing to do with it. The guys went out there and we all executed what we needed to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"At my house? No, not there. If we're celebrating that, no. My house would be destroyed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"It's always been. It trickles down from Joker to the last guy on this roster. We all wish for the success of each individual. When they're on the floor, we're cheering. We're giving them all the support they need to go out there and perform. It was evident last night, when you saw Christian go out there and perform like he did and get the praise that he did. It was well deserved."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"But we all support each other. We know that if a guy or the five that are on the floor play well, we play well and we do well. We all support each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"Man, they've been physical. Like, it's the Finals. They came out since Game 1 playing physical. That's the nature of playing in the Finals. It's all or nothing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"At this point in the season, a lot of it's mental because physically the only thing you're doing is pretty much the game. So mentally if you stay strong, if you stay locked in, that's part of the battle right there. The things that Coach has been doing to keep us in that mold mentally have been great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"I'm going to tell you now, I don't know who was on that team. That's no disrespect to the team. I just wasn't aware of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,No. No. I think all our focus has been on the now and trying to accomplish now and the present time and what we have right now and trying to make the best out of that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"No, not at all. Not at all. This team is going to fight, fight until the end. They're going to fight all 48 minutes, every game, every play. You cannot let up. You saw that last game. You saw that Game 1. You see it every game. You've seen it every series they've been in throughout these Playoffs. That's just the Heat culture, Spo, Pat Riley, they have done a great job of implementing what they want their players who walk through that door to be like, to play like. The players, they've done it. So it's our job on our Denver Nuggets team, organization, to come in and to battle, to battle them, to match their effort and energy. I think we've been doing a good job of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Man, I was a little under the weather, so I had to skip that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Just the fact that JG opens his doors to the rest of his brothers and the rest of the organization is just a testament to what we've been doing all year long, looking out for the camaraderie not only on the court but off the court as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"So to come together and break bread with the team, understanding win or lose or draw, you got family, is a very important fundamental piece of being a good team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,Really good. His defense has been really sound all Playoffs long. Really all year his defense has been really sound.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"He's great with his hands, has great feet, great footwork. Like, he led the league in kick balls, so he does have great feet, great hands. Is in the right spot. Does a good job communicating. He's just smart. He's cerebral about his defensive approach. He gets the right space that he needs. Plays with an arm's distance, kind of plays the game within the game, you know what I mean? Makes the defense think about what they have to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"That's all you really want to do as a defender, make the opposition think about what they want to do and it kind of takes them out of rhythm."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"We want to score in transition. In the Playoffs, you want to get easy buckets, as many as you can, because the game gets stymied towards the end of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Throughout the entirety of the game, you want to get out and push. Also, it creates cross matches. If I get out and push, if a point guard takes me, then maybe I can post up then draw a double-team and kick it. Same thing for Joker. It creates cross matches."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I don't think Mike has a bigger critic than himself. I think he's hard on himself. We tell him just to keep shooting. That's the one thing that this team has encouraged since I've been here, is when you get an open shot, shoot it. That doesn't change whether you're making it or missing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Mike is one of the best shooters on planet earth. He has one of the best jumpers that there is, of all time, one of the best jumpers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"We're not worried about that. Mike's going to make shots. While he's not making shots, I just encourage him to get touches. What I mean by touches is, any time you can touch the ball is how you get energy in the ball for yourself, then the balls start going in. Whether it be on offense, trying to get an offensive rebound, a tap-back, a deflection or a steal, a strip. Any time you can touch the ball, just do that and it will start to feel more rhythmic for you. The basket will open up, the balls will start going in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,Really unique. Let's see. Who would I compare them to? I don't know. They're their own guys. Never really liked comparisons.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"They're special in their own ways. Very unique players. So I don't know if I'd compare them with anybody. But, yeah, they're a force to be reckoned with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I've never really cared about personal accomplishments. My first six years in the league, I had six different coaches. Not only was I 19 or 18 coming into the NBA, I was also having to learn a system each and every year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I'm learning a new system, trying to make my way. It's hard. You can't really nuance the game how you would like to nuance the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Now I've been with Mike Malone for two and a half years, I'm understanding what he's looking for, I'm understanding what the team is looking for, the organization, where I can kind of manipulate the game in my own right, where I can play within myself, where I can kind of stretch that, the area of what I can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I've always came in with defensive minded as my niche, then a guy that can make plays and do a multitude of things out there on the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"At the end of the day I'm just out here to help my team win, so however it displays itself in that sense I'm fine with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I'm feeling much better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I do what I love to do. That's what's so great about it. I get to play the dunker. So I work the baseline, catch alley-oops and drop-off passes and get to bang out. It's awesome smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"They're both just downright winners, just gifted at the game of basketball. Talented. Yeah, Joker is redefining the game. You are going to start seeing more and more players that can just do everything, regardless of size."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"He's kind of like breaking that mold, kind of like how Magic Johnson did with the point guard position. He's breaking the mold of the center position of not being only dominant down on the block. Now he's being dominant from 40 feet, out of everywhere on the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"To stay down on pump fakes, so I don't go to shot fakes. Do your best to stay out of foul trouble. Make things difficult for him. To be physical with him. But mostly just stay down on pump fakes and stay out of foul trouble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I believe it. Great team bonding. Just relax, get away from basketball a little bit, even though you talk about basketball, which is fine. Just have all the guys there and like so much respect for Jeff who just invited us to his home, which is a beautiful home, by the way. I loved it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah, just great team bonding, talking, whatever it was, having some wine, great food, just enjoying ourselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I don't know. I haven't sat down with everybody yet. Save that question. I'll get to you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, my words of wisdom is just keep doing what you're doing, keep playing hard, keep going out there and just showing everybody what you can do and earn that respect."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But yeah, he's grown since training camp. He's just continuing to be himself and play his game at his own pace."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah, you're right, no pickup game. It's very impressive, like I've said before, just how composed and like how poised he is in these moments. It's great for us, just being a rookie, young, and being in this moment, he's taking it very well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, there's always pressure. Each game is going to be a lot of pressure no matter where it's coming from. But yeah, you've got to try to -- you don't reach this moment as much as you want to, so you've got to try to enjoy, try to come out with wins by any means. But I feel like just being here, this is an exciting moment. You're playing for a championship, to be crowned world champions. I think that's a great moment in itself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Man, he's amazing. Playing with him -- also playing against him when I was on other teams, his IQ, his level of just playing the game, not much of a vocal leader, but he shows it a lot on the court, and just how professional he is off the court, it's amazing just to watch him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's changing. It's becoming a world -- it's been a worldwide sport, and I'm excited just to see what's next."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Stay in your hotel room. It's all about being professional. We've got something ahead of us that's waiting. We set a goal for training camp, that we wanted to be champions. I feel like that's enough to keep everybody focused and pretty much not do anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different, but here, it's crunch time. We've got two more games if we want to be champions. We've got to be professional and stay locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, just some missed shots. It's part of the game. It'll get better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"But missed shots, made shots, we've just got to win because then nobody is paying attention to it. Which we will do. I will be better because whenever I'm better, we are better as a whole."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"A lot of good. Obviously, he is one of the greatest players to play that beautiful game. I'm so excited for the city of Miami, to be able to have a player of that caliber here. I'm excited for the city of Miami in so many different ways. Obviously us being in the Finals and having an opportunity to do something special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Now that he is here, I think all the footballsoccer fans from all over the world are going to come here and get an opportunity to watch him compete. I'm glad he is here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I grade it 10 out of 10. Nobody on my team can afford it, so they don't want to go there and pay for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"It was very important. Yes, I did grow as a player, but I grew as like a personleader because I just always remember the things he told me more often than anything is everybody doesn't go about things the way that you go about it. But there is an organization out there that does, that being this one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"He just told me everything that the Heat are about was about winning, and he wasn't doing anything that he wasn't supposed to be doing. I'm just saying he had been a legend here, still is, and he was just saying the reason he was who he was was because of the way that they went about things here, and he pointed me in this direction."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Obviously, I expect to win. But what makes me proud is these guys are never out of the fight. They're so joyful because we're in this thing together through good and through bad. I'm proud of my guys for that. I love my guys for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,Tomorrow we're going to come out with a lot more energy. We're going to compete at a high level. We're going to get one at home.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I mean, obviously he has been huge in what we have done all year long. But I think his spirits are really high. He is doing everything that he can to come back and help."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know where he is in that process, but I see him working. I see him smiling. I see him being around the guys, which is good for him and even better for us. We want him out there competing with us. We always have. We always will. But whenever he is ready, he'll be back, and he will be better than ever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Honestly, I can't even tell you the answer to it because he can shoot the ball, put the ball on the floor, pass the ball. You've just got to do everything you can to stay between him and the basket, trace the ball with both hands."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"But he is a hell of a player. He has been very, very dominant everywhere on the floor. You're closing out one of the best players if not the best player in the world. It's a handful for anybody that is closing him out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I wouldn't say that I know him enough, but I have met him before. Will I reach out? Probably not. I know he has probably got a ton of stuff going on anyway. He is coming over here to do something special for this city. I won't reach out. I'm happy that he is here, though. I really am. I know we will link whenever he is here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I mean, he gets me open a lot of the times. Then obviously you have to guard him whenever he is rolling, popping. Then when they get him the ball, he is getting the ball to everybody else andor finishing or getting to the free-throw line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"He has been excellent throughout this entire playoff run, throughout the entire series and throughout the entire season. We need him to continually set screens, get out in transition and do everything that he has been doing to help us win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Keep doing what I'm doing. Look to find my guys open on the perimeter, maybe dribble on the perimeter for some handoffs. Honestly, I can't tell you. I don't know. I've got to go back and watch it. But I know I'm going to find my guys. I have to find my guys if we want to win. So keep attacking and get the ball to my guys so they can get shots on goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Being calm, not rattled, is like the best thing ever, knowing that everything is going to be okay, everything is going to be just fine. As long as you give it your all, you go into it every day knowing that you have an opportunity to do something special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"That is what we're doing here. We're having a lot of fun being and competing with one another. That is what we do. Stay calm, stay collected and go out there and do everything together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think it does too much. I just think you have some really talented basketball players on the roster. You have some really genius coaches on the coaching staff and some super genius individuals in the front office. They get everybody on the same page. They get everybody chasing the same goal. They get everybody to give in to the team, let go of the self and really buy into what we're doing here as a whole. Underdog or not, that's just what it is here, and we love it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I wouldn't change anything. Not one thing. I continue to be who I am. We will continue to be who we are as a group, as a team. We're going to go out here and compete together. We're going to win together. We're going to be who we are. I wouldn't change a thing, though."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"It was good. Puerto Rican food, I'm a big foodie, so any opportunity I get to go be around the city, enjoy food, enjoy really good company with people I don't get to see every day, I'm fortunate to do that. I've got a lot of love for all types of food, but for sure all the food around Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I just think recognizing the attack angle their drivers were going in. Sometimes they're attacking to pass, then sometimes they're attacking to score. Jimmy was killing us in hes hesitation situations in Game 2, finding the shooters. So, we tried to stay home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Definitely was disappointed. But, I mean, that just added a chip on my shoulder to come out and prove what I know I can do in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,Denver was just a perfect fit. Everything obviously fell right in place how we thought it would. So I'm happy to be here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it was great. I mean, not a lot of people like to have people at their crib, especially how nice Jeff's house is smiling. But it was great. The whole team was there. All the coaches were there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,It wasn't even talking about basketball. We were just having a great time being around each other and seeing how nice Jeff's house is smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I think just being a Bostonian. Everybody from Boston loves Boston. Me growing up there, that's all I knew."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I think just the grind of being there, growing up, loving where I'm from, loving the sports, loving everybody I've met being from there. It just speaks for me being from Boston."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Definitely a lot of hoopers from Boston that I looked up to like Shabazz Napier, Wayne Selden, those guys who I've actually watched play. I watched Shabazz play in the BNBL when I was there when I was younger."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Without those guys, I don't think I would be here. I didn't think a kid from where I'm from can make it out. Those guys played a huge role in my success."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, that duo is just almost impossible to stop. They can score whenever they want when they're aggressive. They know each other's tendencies, where they like to get the ball, where they like to shoot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I mean, for any team it's tough to stop them two. The rest of the team, we got to play off them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"No. No, he never told me that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Miami, our offense, anybody can be the 1. Everybody has to have the ball in their hands to make plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I came into the league as a guard. I started playing guard my second year in Detroit. It's just the role in Brooklyn was the only way for me to get on the floor, so I had to do that. I did really well at it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,Now I like being back in my normal position.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I got a couple, a little more than usual obviously. The same people that always text me texted me. The same people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Nikola. I think Nikola and Jamal put me in the right places. Obviously, our team is set up for everybody to succeed, everybody to be in the right spots. I've said it a million times, it's just my job to be in the right spot when my name is called."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think I've been doing it since high school. I don't even mean to, to be honest with you. It just kind of comes out. I can't really control it. Those are the plays I like to make. Jamal actually told me to run through a pass in the first half, be more aggressive. When I made the play, obviously that's just kind of my natural reaction."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, I'm just grateful to be here obviously. This is something I wanted to do my whole life, something I wanted to do since I stepped foot in Denver. I'm grateful to be here. Just really enjoying the opportunity, enjoying the moment, enjoying the basketball games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"He's not big on advice. I mean, that's just not him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like I said, he puts me in the right spots, makes my life a lot easier. Same with Jamal. Me and Jamal talk a lot. Like I said, he was the one that told me in the first half, Hey, could have run through the pass. Be more aggressive. Like I said, put me in the right spot to make that play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They help me and help everybody on the team, put everybody in the right spots, make everybody's life easier. So we appreciate those guys. Obviously, we're going to ride them to a championship for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, I think there's so much attention on Jamal, on Nikola, that guys like me, Mike, AG, Bruce, KCP all look better. They make it so much easier on us. When they do make those plays, it's our job to make their life easier, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,We wouldn't be that open if there wasn't that much attention on them. They make the right play every time. Playing with guys that make the winning play and make the right play every single time on the court is really fun. I think that's what this team is built around. I think we're doing a really good job of it. We got two more games.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think he found me a little more than I found him obviously.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I mean, we got to find a way to beat the zone. They're a really good team. They make really good adjustments, have a great coach. We got to find a way to beat the things that they throw at us. They've thrown different things. They've thrown the press, they've thrown the zone at us. Try to give you a lot of different looks, try to keep you on your heels."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They've doing a really good job of it. Our coaches are putting us in the right position, too, to counter them and beat them, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think the biggest difference, I just think the adjustments. I mean, in the NCAA championship, it's one game, who's going to play harder, who makes shots. It's just one game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"This, every time after a game, you got to go back and make adjustments. You don't know what the team's going to throw at you. There's more opportunities to get it right in this, but you have to be consistent, you have to stay healthy. A lot of things got to go your way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's a lot of differences, but I think the NBA Finals is more fun, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I mean, obviously Nikola, especially for me, like I said, makes my life a lot easier, makes me look a lot better on the court. So I'm very grateful to play with a guy like him. Just the style that they, how skilled they are, is a great addition to our game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Nikola, obviously Im grateful for him. We're all grateful for what he's brought, the consistency he's brought to the organization."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Force them into difficult shots and, when they miss, get the rebound."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Considering I've been in that position the first Finals, having to sit and watch your team go through that battle and try it figure it out without you. But I think he is in good spirits. He is definitely inching his way back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"But the biggest thing is him getting healthy, at the end of the day. We want him to be fully healthy so when he does return, if he does, we'll have that same Tyler during the season where he was being that bucket getter that we know him for."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"How did I get through it? I mean, me personally, it was just I had to be on the court in a different way. That was me talking on the bench, me giving energy. Anything I could do that would put me as close on the court as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Biggest thing is just read and react. Easier said than done, obviously. But pretty much read and react and watching film."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"One, it's Spo. So that's only a Spo term."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"We've been through so much this season, ups, downs, goods, bads. A lot of you in here probably never thought we would be in this position right now. So I feel like that is what he means when he says a gnarly team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Watching film, watching some of the greats screen. Then obviously the way we run offense. Everybody is involved. Everybody is prepared and everybody is ready to rock. One through 5 are alive. My screens are the biggest thing to get the guy open because if he is live, I'm live, that makes everybody else live, and that is a good recipe for success."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"I didn't even think about that. What's today? Wow, that's tomorrow. Ain't got a lot of time for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,I don't know what I will be getting them. I'm pretty sure they're fine if we don't get them anything.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"The biggest thing is we'll be playing on their birthday. Coming into this building and getting a win, I feel like they'll both be happy with that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"You trust one another to do their job, and you let the chips fall where they may. You trust 1 through 5, 1 through 15. You trust the staff. Everybody has a belief that you can get that job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"If everybody has that belief and everybody comes with the right mindset, that is how you can get it done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"No. You see a person, they shoot the ball, you see who is closest to you, you box them out and everybody will run for the rebound."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,I think their approach was great. I think they got to their two-man early and it was pretty effective for them tonight.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,"We can be way more intentional following our game plan. We got away from that a little bit. We have a small margin of error, so we got to be more detailed with our stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,"Every team weve played this playoff run has had quote-unquote size on us, so we arent going to start making that excuse now, respectfully."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,I think that was more of a product of our lack of detail offensively. Just our spacing and attention.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's complex. It's a headache. They can beat you with the pass, beat you off dribble, beat you from the three-point line, in transition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So it really becomes about collectively wrapping your mind around doing really tough things. Sometimes it's not going to be perfect or how you thought it might go, but you have to compete and find a way to overcome."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, for sure, it's way more impactful when it's coming from your two best players. Jimmy and Bam both are really unselfish. They both want to play the right way. They want to get guys involved. They understand intellectually how important it is to have everybody as a live weapon."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,So you see them make a lot of simple plays. It doesn't have to be their play. It could be a play just where they get off the ball and other guys can be recipients of that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In terms of the shooting, our guys always have that green light. They have the confidence of everybody. But we've also proven that we're not totally reliant on that because you can't always control whether you're making shots or not. You still can compete and find different ways to win a game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I wouldn't necessarily say that. But we're still day-to-day. I don't have another update for you. He is scheduled to have another full-contact workout tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He has not been cleared yet. So until he has been cleared, a lot of this stuff is really just hypothetical."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it has to be a sprint. You have to have a next-play speed mentality, for sure, because if you're late or you glitch for a second, Jokic is such a great defensive rebounder, if he gets anywhere from 12 to 15 to 18 rebounds, how many of those -- 10? -- will be bust-outs. So it's a little bit different than some of the transition stuff we've been dealing with in previous series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But the common denominator is trying to take away some easy ones, relief ones. We've had some practice in playing against speed teams in the previous series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yes. I think that would be good. Yeah. I think it would be good. I don't know what the unintended consequences are, but I always feel like if I burn one whenever, early in a game and you win it, it's like, oh, geez, I would like to have another one. But then we're dealing with -- if that is the case, then all the players starting the first minute of the game twirls finger in the air. I hate that, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's a challenge. Yeah. That's why it transcends scheme. It really becomes a mentality. Our guys love to compete. They love big challenges, love to be out there in front of everybody, out there for everybody to judge, to see, but to really have it be decided between those four lines."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"All the time. He is the voice I trust more than anybody. I listen to my staff -- we're in the trench every single day. Pat and I's relationship has evolved in so many different ways over the years. Now it's really -- he is just a calming presence. Sometimes in those moments in between, probably if you see us maybe in the stands or after practice or something, everybody probably thinks that we're scheming and planning and all this stuff. A lot of times we're just BSing and he is asking how the kids are doing. He just has a way of alleviating some of the pressure that we all feel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't think that's fair. I don't think anybody can predict that. None of us are Nostradamus in terms of that. What you try to do is just find like-minded guys where we speak the same language, where it's a fit, and then we can figure out the rest. Then ultimately we all have to prove it on this kind of stage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But when you're not speaking the same language and you don't view competition the same way, whatever your culture may be, I think that's where it can be a little bit complicated."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's a great duo. Their games really complement each other. You have one guy that really can score in a lot of different ways. Another guy who is setting great screens or handoffs, and if the ball gets back to him, he can get a bunch of people involved."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Certainly at the beginning of game, that kind of set the tone. But from there, we lost a lot of physical 5050 or ball in the air, ball on the floor battles throughout the course of the game, at key moments. When the moments could have been swing moments, they were coming up with those plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,You have to expect that -- not losing the battles. You have to expect there to be elite talent in the Finals. Both those guys are elite-level talent.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"At our best version, we find ways to overcome that, make it tough on them and then certainly not lose the overwhelming majority of those physical battles, the 5050 battles, the ball in the air, ball on the floor battles."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That made it too much to overcome. The dynamic of those two, but also getting all the extra, effort points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, I wouldn't even say that. They just pummeled us in the paint. They didn't really have to shoot threes. They had, whatever, 60 in the paint. They probably shot over 65 percent in the paint at the rim there. Wasn't a need to space the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We didn't offer much resistance. A lot of those plays were relief points in transition that kind of gave them some separation. Some cuts, some timely cuts and then timely offensive rebounds that led to either buckets or free throw attempts from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I thought offensively, we actually did get a lot of opportunities in the paint. I haven't even seen the percentage I don't have my glasses right now. But I would have to say our percentage in the rim or in the paint was pretty poor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yes, you do have to credit their size and everything like that, but we have proven that we can finish in the paint when we're at our best. But offensively, yeah, there's some -- definitely some things where we got flattened out, and they jammed us up in possessions. Got us late into possessions. Then sometimes we're forced with those plays, and that can kind of have a different flow and feel to it than if it's just in our typical rhythm of our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I just think sometimes, for us, when we lose a lot of those physical battles, the effort plays, the loose balls, the rebounding battles, that's our identity, and sometimes that can affect the flow of the rest of your game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's not an excuse. I think the thing that we've proven over and over and over is we can win and find different ways to win regardless of whether we have confidence, regardless whether the ball is going in. We have a determination to impact the game and find a different solution or different way to win a game regardless of whether the ball is going in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It felt like at times, some of those missed shots at the rim or in the paint, the makeable shots that we've made the last several months or weeks, that affected a little bit of our, whatever, going down the other end. And that hasn't happened a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I do want to get to the film because I'm not totally sure about that. Just it felt like that. We're at our best when we're winning those battles first, so you can just check that box, the physical battles, 5050s, ball in the air, ball on the floor. We win those battles, we figure everything else out along the way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Yes. Laughter. Well said.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I would think so. They probably felt the same way coming off their loss. The extra day, whatever, they -- yeah. Our guys are built to compete, built to get out there. That cadence of playing every 48 hours, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We'll get to work tomorrow, for sure. But our guys, they want to get out there and compete and have a better showing for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, there's a lot of different layers to that, right? Your offensive execution, your intentionality offensively of getting the right shots. It certainly helps making some of those shots in the paint or at the rim."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But regardless, we have proven that we can figure it out even if we're not making 70 percent of shots in the paint or on rim attempts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But then your floor balance matters, and then your next-play speed, the brain speed to get on to the next play and make sure you have three or four guys back, and then communication from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They did get some relief points, particularly in that first half, when it was either tied or we had small leads that they just came right back with some relief points that just kind of kept them alive and kept the momentum shifting a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"The last shot felt good. It was more like throughout the game. I felt like I didn't bring the intensity that the moment called for. Even though I didn't play terrible, I felt like I could have done a lot more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Most people that have watched the Nuggets play, when I have a game like that, I'm most likely going to bounce back. Just one of those days. I think not just me but everybody bounced back. Everybody brought the energy. K only took four shots but he was into everybody. Michael was grabbing boards, even though he wasn't making shots. AG, same thing, 10 boards, didn't shoot well. Actually shot 50 percent. My bad."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, just everybody was just coming into the game and wanting to bring the intensity that we're used to playing with. I thought CB was great, and I thought Jeff was great, and everybody was ready to play tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he knows what to do to stay on the floor. He's solid on defense, shoots the gaps, plays hard, in the right spot he crashes, plays solid defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"He knows the offense will come when he's doing those things, and he's playing with a lot of confidence. We're finding him like he's a five-year vet. He's just playing the game the right way, every game. Even if he makes mistakes he knows how to bounce back, and I think that's huge for a rookie, especially getting these kind of minutes. He's got a lot more game to come, not just in these Finals but in his career. Excited to see what he can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"What he does, he makes it look so easy. You grabbed 21 boards and everybody is talking about he can't jump, and he's out there battling everyone, he's physical, he's strong, 30 points, people say he doesn't want to score. Gives you 32. Then 10 assists."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"He just makes the game look easy throughout the game, and like I said, just free throws, his touch, his creativity, his no-look passes, his II could go down the line. He's a special, special player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'd say it's a trust and a feel, that's the best way for me to put it. It's not really X's and O's. It's just reading the game and trusting that the other is going to make the right play. If he throws it to me, he knows and expects what to see from me, and he knows the mood I'm in, the intensity I'm playing with, whether it's low or high, time and score, and vice versa. I know when he's overpassing, I know when he's looking to score, I know when he's the best player on the floor, I know when he's taking a second to get into the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it's just a feel and a trust that we're going to figure it out, and it's a lot of unselfishness, like I keep bringing that up. It's free flowing. If something is there, we go. If it's not, we don't force it. He makes tough shots look easy, and he's been doing it for a very long time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,I think the consistency doesn't get talked about enough.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"As the shot clock was going down and I just got to my spot and just sunk it down, just a drill shot that I practiced basically my whole life."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think we've got a great team bond. We're very tight. Everybody is comfortable saying something to each other, getting on each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I told CB at halftime to shoot the gap and get the steal. He had a chance to do it in the first half and he didn't go. Second half he went for it. Just the confidence he has to go in the game and gamble like that seconds after I just told him. Like I said, he's going to grow and he's going to be a very, very solid player in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'm excited to see him develop his game and gain more confidence, more trust from not just us, the coaching staff, as well, and see him grow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it's a mixture. Sometimes it's an effort play. Sometimes the ball just comes to you. Sometimes somebody else does the dirty work and boxes the big guy out. I think it's everybody chipping in to get those rebounds. That's not an individual stat. Like I said, Mike on the boards. AG on the boards following his own misses. I'll come in and help out. Joke is down there battling every time, every game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"So I think it's a collective effort. Sometimes you may not get it but you may be the reason that somebody else gets it, and I think we did a great job collectively giving them one shot and getting out and running."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"You know, if people ask, it's a big stage, do you get nervous and stuff? You're supposed to be. That's what makes you care. That's what makes you alive. That's what makes you enjoy these moments. It's good to feel that. I just kind of get into zone, meditate a little bit, lock back in, knowing this is what I do, this is what I've been doing for my whole life, this is what I've wanted to do I my whole life. This is the stage I've been working personally to get to my whole life."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"All the butterflies, that's supposed to happen. That shows that you care and that shows that you're excited."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Not just me but he's always checking on guys, seeing their mood and tone, and I just think he does a great job, especially at this stage, of communicating what he's thinking as well, not just picking your brain."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"But he has, like I said, we've been playing together for seven years now, and he's got a lot of trust in me and my capability and most of all the energy and intensity that I bring. He's excited for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"He knew it wasn't my best in Game 2, and he looked forward for me to get it back in Game 3."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it speaks for itself. It speaks for itself, bro. Like I said, how many times does he have to do that for you guys to believe in his game or our game or whatever? Like he's doing it, making it look so easy, good shooting, low turnovers, two blocked shots, got great hands, great communication in the pick-and-rolls, and IQ and all that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I say, we're running out of things to say. He makes the game look easy, and like I said, the consistency that he's doing that with, not just the first time in the Finals, he's done that before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's fun to play with, fun to watch and be a part of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, that was crucial for us tonight, points in the paint. They did a great job of getting the ball to certain places for Jokic and getting him and Murray in their spots. We have to do a great job of making it tougher on the catches and putting more pressure on those guys to get tougher looks than that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, they are two great players. They obviously had triple-doubles and they can get it done, whether that's passing, playmaking, shotmaking, whatever it is. That's the reason why they are playing for a championship right now. They are one of the best duos in the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"But I don't think that we did enough, as much as we are capable of doing, and making it tough on those guys, kind of like we did in Game 2. Just find ways in adjusting to the fact they are getting to their spots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"We just have to have a better approach mentally. Whenever their shots are falling, we can't let that trickle into our offense. Make sure we stay with it and put more pressure on those guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, they did a great job of staying home and making our guys make tough twos. They made adjustments. That's part of it. That's part of the playoffs. You're going to see different coverages, different looks every game. Every game is going to be a different game. So that was the game tonight, and it will be a different game, Game 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it was more than a few. We had a lot more than a few breakdowns in Game 2 and give them credit because they took advantage of almost every miscue that we had or breakdown that we had."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"A huge part of it for us is just cleaning up our communication. That was the main message in our film session, in our practice, in our shootaround this morning was getting our communication going early. But when you have a guy like Max Strus or Duncan Robinson, who are elite shooters, it's all about getting separation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"They're doing a really good job of creating separation, and we're doing a poor job of allowing it. So, communicate early, be more physical, take away their airspace, and try to make them play inside the three-point line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Oh, it's between Jamal and I. He understands how important he is to this team. He understands how much I care about him, not just as a player but as a person."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,My job is not just to point out mistakes. My job is not just to applaud guys when they're playing well. It's also just to be there for them and provide whatever support I can.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I do that for everybody, not just Jamal Murray. But yeah, that conversation will just kind of remain private if you don't mind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I mean, so they start Kevin Love, I think six points, 10 rebounds, three offensive, two made threes, and a guy that's been on this stage before, so you know he's not going to be rattled."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But let's be honest, the guy that he replaced could have been the Eastern Conference Finals MVP. So, it's not like Caleb Martin is not a good player, but I think for them, it was making sure they just had a little bit more size in the game, help with the rebounding."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But give K-Love credit, man. That guy is a journeyman. He's really impacted this team with his professionalism, maturity, and the three-point shooting, the rebounding, the outlet passing, whatever you want to call it. He did a really good job to help them in that second game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I would echo what Jamal mentioned. It was really neat with Jeff having a house -- he was nice enough to have us go over there and break bread with his family. The whole team went. It allowed everybody to reset, take a deep breath, take the edge off."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,And yesterday's film session was -- wasn't an emotional film session. That's not going to get us anywhere. It was a constructive film session where everybody had a chance to speak up and talk about each clip and what they see and how we can be better.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I also agree that we are a very resilient group. We've proven that year in and year out, whether that's being down 3-1, whether it's having guys out to injury. This group never ceases to amaze me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I believe that maybe us losing a game at home for the first time in the postseason and playing the way we did, you never want to go through that, but you have to take a negative and make it into a positive, and maybe that's a wake-up call. Maybe it's like hey, man, understand the moment that we're in, and don't ease into it and be disciplined in your approach, be urgent in your approach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,I have no doubt that our guys will go out there and play a much better game than we did in Game 2 in Denver.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think all of us were disappointed, from myself to all of our players. We were disappointed in Game 2, how we performed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"The funny thing is even after the third quarter, I think they had 75 points and 43 percent from the field and were up eight. I don't think we had played well to that point. Then the start of the fourth quarter, obviously that 15-2 run was a deadly run and kind of gave them some separation, then we got back in the game late."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But the last couple days I think there's been some frustration, and then the second part of that is coming together and realizing that all we have is each other, and we're going to need each other to play a lot better, a lot harder and a lot more disciplined if we're going to regain home-court advantage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's the first time in Finals history or maybe NBA history that two guys have 30, 10 triple-doubles, so that's incredible right there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Regarding Nikola, nothing he does surprises me ever. This guy has shown time and time again that he's built for these moments. He thrives in these moments, the biggest stage. He did that once again tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I'm really proud of Jamal, and I could tell speaking to him yesterday, being around him the last 48 hours, that he was putting a lot of Game 2 on him, and it wasn't just him. It was me and every one of our players. It was collective."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But that's what champions do. That's what warriors do. They battled back. I felt his presence all day long. Forget the stats for a second. I felt Jamal's presence, his energy, and he was here in the moment, and for him and Nikola to do what they did tonight in a game that we needed to take, regain home-court advantage of the series was special to watch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But it wasn't just those two. I felt Aaron Gordon 11, 10 and 5, I thought Michael Porter's seven boards and Christian Braun. I have to give Christian a lot of love. I felt his play was fantastic. Did not look like a rookie, aggressive, strong, physical, confident, and his 15 and 4 off the bench in 19 minutes were very, very impactful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Good win for us, but we did not come down here to get one win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I've been with Nikola for eight and Jamal for seven years now, and we've had some pretty good moments, but not in the NBA Finals. For those guys to make history the way they did tonight, no one has ever done that. I mean, that's what's really neat about it. You get the win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought our defense was fantastic tonight. You hold that team to 94 points, 37 from the field, only 11 threes, that really helped us out tonight. The defending and rebounding at a high level, but by far their greatest performance as a duo in their seven years together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"It means that our guys understood Game 2 was not who we are. It's not who we can be, especially at this stage of the season, and they responded like they always do. That's one thing I know about our group When we don't play well, we own it, and we find a way to be resilient and get back to playing Denver Nugget basketball, and that's what we did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Christian has proved himself all year long, and he was in the rotation end of season. He's been in the rotation throughout these 18 playoff games now, and if you look around, there's not many rookies playing meaningful minutes in the NBA this time of year, and it speaks to Christian's confidence. It speaks to him being a winner. He's won at every level High school, college, and now he's in the NBA Finals as a rookie in the NBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"He just has stayed ready the whole year, mentally, physically, emotionally. That kid never gets too high, never gets too low. Very calm, cool and collected young man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Tonight, man, I could just feel the confidence kind of oozing out of him, the physical aggressive drives, making plays for guys against their zone. It was really fun to watch a young man step up like the way Christian did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've always felt that Nikola and Jamal Murray are one of the most elite and lethal two-man game combos in the NBA, and we've seen that growing for seven years now and I think it was on full display once again tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"A lot of guys play with each other. I think those two guys play for each other and off of each other and they read each other so well. The best part about it is early in the game, Jamal was getting blitzed tonight. He had two guys on him a lot, and he didn't fight it. I think early in the Playoffs there were games where he was getting attention and he was trying to make like the home run play maybe at times, but for him tonight to come off -- I got two guys on me? I'm just going to find Nikola in the pocket or Christian Braun cutting, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I was really impressed with Jamal's performance. But those two guys as a two-man combo, they give a lot of people headaches."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, he showed up with that. That young man, like I said earlier, when you win three straight high school state championships, when you win a National Championship in which he never came out of the game, played all 40 minutes, he's very confident, and he should be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"We believed in him, we drafted him, and he's everything we hoped for and more, but that confidence is something that his mother, his father, his family, I think he's had from a very early age."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, usually it's a lot more likely when Nikola sits. I don't know if you guys realized, but Nikola didn't sit in the second half. So when I congratulated him after the game for his 32, 10 and 21 rebound performance, I said, Maybe we're on to something here. You may not come out in the second half the rest of the series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, Jamal is going to attract so much attention, but usually it's when Nikola's off because if you put two on the ball, Jamal, and he finds Nikola in the pocket, something good is usually going to happen The mid-range shot where he's almost automatic, Aaron or Jeff working behind the defense or spraying out to a three-point shooter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's the type of game that Jamal was having, and he adjusted to how he was being guarded, which is what you need from your starting point guard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I felt this is by far our best game of the series, most complete game of the series. It's not because of the triple-doubles, or to your point all the individual stats. It's because we held that team to 94 points, 37 from the field, only 11 threes. And to out-rebound somebody by 25 in a Finals game, that's a significant number right there. And it wasn't just Nikola's 21. Aaron gets 10, Jamal gets 10, Michael gets seven, Christian gets four, 28 assists, 60 points in the paint. And the fourth quarter defense, only 31 percent from field allowed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I loved our energy, our urgency, our discipline. I thought we were where we needed to be tonight, and we'll have to be even better come Friday evening."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"It is. His one year at Kentucky, he was a prolific scorer, obviously played off the ball with Tyler Ulis many years ago. And I often laugh when I think of his first two years in Denver he was our backup shooting guard, and now he's getting a triple-double in the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, Jamal, he's a guy that thrives, lives and excels in the moment. Never afraid of it. You can't say that for a lot of players. I mean, the regular season guys had really good seasons, but in the Playoffs, on this stage, and Jamal missed our last two post-seasons and he's been dying to get back to this setting, and just go out there and put on the performance that he's putting on. Really proud of him bouncing back from Game 2, as well as all of our players bouncing back the way we did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Once again, Friday night we know we're going to have to be even better against a very good team in Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"I think one thing about Coach tonight, he knew how they were going to come out aggressive, and we just didn't -- we didn't match the force that we needed -- we didn't play with the force we needed to play with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"You know, I think that was their objective, to get in the paint, get inside and use their size and physicality. And, yeah, that's what they did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"I don't know. Honestly, I think we had opportunities to make some layups but missed them. Short-armed a few of them. Missed some layups. We attacked fairly well tonight. We got to the paint and we got to our spots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,We just missed easy ones. Bam missed some shots that he usually makes and Jimmy missed some layups that he usually makes.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"But that's the game of basketball. You make some you miss some. But we got to the spots. We got 92 shots up, so that's a positive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"I think the game started off with Jamal Murray and it kind of made Jokic's game a little -- you know, a little bit easier. We had the help on Jamal. Jokic is going to get his. He's a two-time MVP. He knows how to play basketball. He's really talented."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"Sometimes, like you say, he's going to do what he's going to do. 32-10-21, that's pretty good numbers. He's seven feet. He can do pretty much everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think Jamal set the tone for their group, and he was aggressive, assertive. And, you know, he set the tone, and it made things a little bit easier for Jokic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we win. I think it's pretty simple. But he's playing phenomenal, I think, the whole playoff. We're just following him, like I said, and he's a really good leader. His energy is amazing, and we are just following."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, it doesn't help when you miscommunication or stupid turnovers or whatever. But they're a good team, and we need to give them the respect. It's not just us. They are playing, too. I think it's a really interesting series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,We just got one today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I just think it's a win because if you lose, nobody is going to even mention -- even to be honest, I don't care. It's just a stat."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I think it's just respect of each other and relationship over the years and communication, and I think -- but it's not just us. I'm always saying yes, we had good games, but Christian Braun had amazing game, Bruce had a really good game, Jeff played really well, AG played really good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not just us, it's the team, and like I said even before the series started, Denver Nuggets need to beat Miami, not me and Jamal and whoever is on the other side. We as a group need to beat them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's reading the game really well. He's getting guys involved, and I think he's mature, if that makes any sense, and he knows where to find the guys and how to control the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"On the first question, I don't know if it's the best or -- I don't know. We're just trying to win a game right now. We can think about that later."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I told him, you won us the game. Like you said, he's a winner, and he won us the game, with energy, just the focus, the mindset. Even when he make a mistake, it's an aggressive mistake, so you cannot be mad at him. I always say that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He won us the game, and he was really good tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes. I mean, this is the right time if you're going to play your best basketball, I think this is the right time to play your best basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But I think, like you said, the team is really important, yes. A couple guys maybe didn't make shots or they didn't play well, but there is other guys who can step up and fill that position and be even better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"When you lose the game, of course it's a bad atmosphere, whatever, it's a bad momentum. But maybe help us to refocus and just be better in the details. But that doesn't mean that we can relax now or whatever. We need to have the same effort because they're going to be even better. So we need just to have the same or better focus and effort in Game 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I really don't know, my friend. That's a good question. I'm just trying to -- when you play the game, sometimes it's open, sometimes it's not, sometimes you shoot, you make, you miss. We really don't think that when you play. I really don't have an answer for you. My bad."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we saw everything. I'm always saying that's why they're so great. They have so many defenses, and they're really good in every defense that they're putting out there. They are so aggressive, they are playing on the passing lanes, they are into the guards. Even in the zone they are so active. Everybody is moving."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,Then in one moment they are blitzing Jamal.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That's why they are so dangerous and they are so affecting the game, and they're changing the momentum of the game and speed of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He has a nice house. Laughter. Yes, he has a nice house."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I mean, Jeff is a 27-year-old veteran. He's a guy who -- he's so professional. I think all the young guys that come into the league or just if they have the opportunity to talk to him or to see his work ethic and see how he is approaching the game, the practice, the workout, the weight lifting. He's really professional, and that's why he's so, so long in the league. Having us in his house, it's a really nice thing of him, and hopefully one time we can come to celebrate a little bit better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, we won. Thats what we wanted to do. I think we came out with a better focus, better attention to start our defense off with communication, which we didnt do well with Game 2. I dont like the way we finished, obviously. Weve got to find a way to finish that fourth quarter and not give them any hope."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"They played amazing. They took what the defense gave them. Jokic, he has been doing it all year. Both of them, Jamal as well. We feed off of those guys. They make the game easy for us and we try to do the same for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"He was huge. He was huge. His energy, the way he made plays on the defensive end that led to easy offensive baskets."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"Hes very very mature for his age. Hes been in situations where he has played for a title, in the NCAA Tournament last year. Obviously, its not quite the same, but the aspect of fighting until the very end and fighting for a championship, he understands and he showed it tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,Thats every game. He uses his size to his advantage. The way he is on the boards. Aaron can do a lot of things on that floor.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"Obviously, I dont think he gets enough respect. Ive always said that. He is showcasing it on the biggest stage. He gives us energy on both ends of the court, the way he defends, also the way he attacks on offense. He has been big for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,Weve got to keep it up. Weve got two more games to win.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,We got a win. Weve got to do it again. We have another game in a couple days. Weve got to bring the same amount of energy and effort.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"Its just one game. Everybody has said it throughout the playoffs Its the first to four. So weve got to duplicate what we did tonight, plus a little bit more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, we won. Thats what we wanted to do.

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I would say that it's what they do every game. They make the right play. They didn't try to force anything. That's what we expect from them, and they make everything easier on us. That's what they do every game and they make the right plays, and they didn't force anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's greatness, man. It's greatness. That's a dynamic duo right there. Like CB said, they make the right play, they do what the game is asking of them, they take what the game is giving them, and that's the type of game that we kind of expect from them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,We're a resilient group. We're a very prideful group. We don't like how we played in Game 2. It was an opportunity to bounce back and just hold ourselves accountable and play to the standard that we've been playing all year long.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Those guys makes it really easy. Playing with those guys, they make the right play every time. My job is just to be ready when my name is called."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Playing with Nikola, playing with Jamal, whoever it is, just got to be ready for the ball, and today found me in some pretty easy spots. Just staying ready, and it's the NBA Finals, so if your name is called, you know you've got to be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's important. When we rebound like that, it's usually a direct correlation to a dub win. We've got to keep eating the glass, continue to rebound on both sides of the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"I think we were over-helping on that. We call it a hes hesitation dribble. You call it Gretzky, like Wayne? For sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"We were just over-helping. He was getting under the basket and we were overreacting, and when we would overreact he would spread the ball out to shooters. Just got to stay home and give the reasonable, respectable amount of help."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, the guys trusted me all year, so when I get in the game, I just try to defend and do the little things, obviously make it easier on me. Like I said, my job is not very hard I've just got to come in, play with energy. And they find me on the right spots on offense and the defense just gives effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,So those guys have trusted me all year and put me in the right spots and my job is to deliver.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Well, we watch this game, we break it down. We have a really, really great coaching staff, so we leave it up to them to analyze the game and break it down and come back to us with a game plan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Essentially we just want to play better. We want to turn up. We don't want stay the same and let them turn up. We want to be the aggressors and yeah, turn up our level of play and be more disciplined, execute better, and just overall be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Man, it's rare. He's a very rare rookie, other than myself. I wouldn't be able to think of anybody else. Smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"No, that's a rare rookie right here. From day one he's been on top of it. This is a real winner right here. I say that because he's always in the right spot. He's in the right place at the right time, and he's been doing that all year, he's been doing that from day one, and nothing changes. He's in the right place at the right time on the biggest stage, and now you guys are getting to see it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"I really think it was our execution on defense and offense but mostly the discipline, the game plan discipline on defense. I think we had far too many breakdowns in Game 2, and I think we had less breakdowns this game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, playing off Nikola, obviously all my buckets tonight were layups, and just playing off of him and playing off of Jamal. So a lot of his buckets come from drop-offs, relocations, whatever it is. So a lot of my buckets did look a lot like Aaron. He's obviously catching lobs and dunking more than I am, but just learning how he moves, obviously I can take a lot from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, those guys trust me, so I can't really fail if I go out there and play hard. They don't expect much from me on the offensive end, but expect me to go out there and give effort on defense, rebound, whatever it is, try to get extra possession for those guys to score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So they trust me, and they put me in the right spots, and all I've got to do is lay a ball in and get a steal. My job is pretty easy, and those guys make me look pretty good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,It was a really big moment. It was a big shot. We need him to step up and take and make those shots. It almost like quieted the crowd and kind of slowed their momentum down a little bit. It was a huge shot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Jamal is a big-shot maker, big-shot taker. He's an ice cold closer, so we expect that from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think Jamal, he expects a lot of himself, and like AG just said, we expect a lot from him. Those are the performances we expect from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"We know he's going to bounce back, but all of us didn't do what we were supposed to do in the last game. We all felt pressure to come out here and focus and get this win, and Jamal was a big part of it today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I would say that it's what they do every game. They make the right play. They didn't try to force anything. That's what we expect from them, and they make everything easier on us. That's what they do every game and they make the right plays, and they didn't force anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's greatness, man. It's greatness. That's a dynamic duo right there.

Just staying ready, and it's the NBA Finals, so if your name is called, you know you've got to be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's important. When we rebound like that, it's usually a direct correlation to a W. We've got to keep eating the glass, continue to rebound on both sides of the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"I think we were over-helping on that. We call it a Hess dribble. You call it Gretzky, like Wayne? For sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"We were just over-helping. He was getting under the basket and we were overreacting, and when we would overreact he would spread the ball out to shooters. Just got to stay home and give the reasonable, respectable amount of help."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, the guys trusted me all year, so when I get in the game, I just try to defend and do the little things, obviously make it easier on me. Like I said, my job is not very hard I've just got to come in, play with energy. And they find me on the right spots on offense and the defense just gives effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,So those guys have trusted me all year and put me in the right spots and my job is to deliver.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Well, we watch this game, we break it down. We have a really, really great coaching staff, so we leave it up to them to analyze the game and break it down and come back to us with a game plan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Essentially we just want to play better. We want to turn up. We don't want stay the same and let them turn up. We want to be the aggressors and yeah, turn up our level of play and be more disciplined, execute better, and just overall be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Man, it's rare. He's a very rare rookie, other than myself. I wouldn't be able to think of anybody else. Smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"No, that's a rare rookie right here. From day one he's been on top of it. This is a real winner right here. I say that because he's always in the right spot. He's in the right place at the right time, and he's been doing that all year, he's been doing that from day one, and nothing changes. He's in the right place at the right time on the biggest stage, and now you guys are getting to see it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"I really think it was our execution on defense and offense but mostly the discipline, the game plan discipline on defense. I think we had far too many breakdowns in Game 2, and I think we had less breakdowns this game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, playing off Nikola, obviously all my buckets tonight were lay-ups, and just playing off of him and playing off of Jamal. So a lot of his buckets come from drop-offs, relocations, whatever it is. So a lot of my buckets did look a lot like Aaron. He's obviously catching lobs and dunking more than I am, but just learning how he moves, obviously I can take a lot from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, those guys trust me, so I can't really fail if I go out there and play hard. They don't expect much from me on the offensive end, but expect me to go out there and give effort on defense, rebound, whatever it is, try to get extra possession for those guys to score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So they trust me, and they put me in the right spots, and all I've got to do is lay a ball in and get a steal. My job is pretty easy, and those guys make me look pretty good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,It was a really big moment. It was a big shot. We need him to step up and take and make those shots. It almost like quieted the crowd and kind of slowed their momentum down a little bit. It was a huge shot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Jamal is a big-shot maker, big-shot taker. He's an ice cold closer, so we expect that from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think Jamal, he expects a lot of himself, and like AG just said, we expect a lot from him. Those are the performances we expect from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"We know he's going to bounce back, but all of us didn't do what we were supposed to do in the last game. We all felt pressure to come out here and focus and get this win, and Jamal was a big part of it today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"We feel great. We didn't play our best tonight. I feel like we just got to come out with more energy and effort, and that's correctible. That's on us as a group. No X's and O's can fix that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"So come out, dive on the floor, get loose balls, get defensive rebounds and maybe, just maybe, it would have been a different game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"I can only speak for myself, but I missed some that I normally make, along with Bam, too. But we are going to continually get those. Getting two feet in the paint, if you can get a shot up, get it up. If you can't, get it out to your shooters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think we did a good job with that. Maybe we do have to do a better job of finishing. But those are the same shots that we're going to get next game, and we are expected to take and make those."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"One, Jokic can pass, and Jamal is looking to score. I feel like that's what makes it so dynamic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,I don't know. I can't answer that. Maybe we're at home we think we did something. I don't know. It just can't happen. It won't happen again.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"It starts with myself. I have to lock in on the defensive end. I have to go up and get loose balls. I think if I start playing and doing that, then everybody else has to follow suit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know. We're going to get back to the film and figure it out, because we do have to be better guarding both of those guys. One is the ball-hander and one is the guy that is setting the screen and popping and rolling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's not an easy task to do, but if we want to win, we are going to have to figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"All five guys get back. I feel like that eliminates the transition. Everybody get back, low to the ball and we figure it out from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"Two feet in the paint. Shoot the shots that I know that I can make. Stay aggressive. It's the same thing. I think if guys were open, like I said, I've always got to pass it to them. I will continually do that. But if I get two feet in the paint, I'm expected to shoot a layup or a floater, and I'm expected to make it, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"I mean, I'm in-game, so I'm not really focused on fans leaving. I'm really focused on, can we get a stop, can we score and then see if we can come back in this game with 50 seconds left."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,They look at film. They definitely watched the game plan. The biggest thing for us is watch film and see how we can get Max open again.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,Appreciate you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"Black lives matter, people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I just feel a great sense of pride, you know, to be able to represent a country with so many people that, you know, really value how we perform and how we play. You know, I just take a lot of pride in representing them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"No, I love Miami in general as a city, the people, the culture, the food, you name it. It's kind of like its own little country to be honest. It's very unique in that way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I'm sure I did it very young. I don't know, man, probably 10 or so. You know, basic 2-3 zone, like most kids probably."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"A little bit. I wouldn't say -- our zone isn't as traditional as many zones are, especially at this level. You've kind of got to be a little creative. But certain principles in terms of making sure you box out and rebound. It's hard to rebound in the zone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I'm not surprised how much we do it. We're just trying to win. I think it's effective because it's different, and like I said, it's not necessarily a traditional zone that we play. You know, other teams in the NBA run a zone or will play zone, and everyone's kind of looks a little different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,It's kind of a different look regardless who you're playing against.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,I think it was just good basketball. We got the ball where it needed to go and we were able to create advantages and move the ball and find an open guy.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,I think that was just my passion talking at the moment and I was just in the moment of the game. I don't think there was anything really to it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Bam's been great, his reads offensively, especially thinking about how much energy he's expending defensively, the way his mind, his brain speed has been going. I think he's been making great reads, and I think he'll continue to, whether it's a pass or shot or attack or whatever the case may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,When I train. I try to push myself to those points of being uncomfortable to try to grow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,At this point that you guys don't know? Probably not. But I definitely have been meditating before each game and it's been quite helpful for me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Oh, no. When we kind of get close to game time, I'm pretty locked in on my own routine, so I kind of miss what they have got going on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I think we just have the habits built for it. We have had a number of close games this season. Probably too many than we would have liked but they helped us prepare for moments like that, when we need to adjust on the fly or, you know, put in a wrinkle, and it's in a pressure situation. The more reps you have with that, the less, quote, unquote, pressure you feel, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think our depth is definitely a strength of ours, and it's been someone different pretty much every game in these playoffs in terms of our supporting cast that has a game or plays well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"All of our guys are capable, and when they get their moment, they usually step up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, if I had our group, I'd like our chances, regardless of who we played."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I think it's a lot of what the culture represents and signifies matches who I am as a person. It matches my character. So, I think it was a little easier for me to assimilate to the quote, unquote culture, and although it isn't for everybody, I think it is for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"I love it here. Walking outside every day, the weather is phenomenal. But I will say, the fan support we've had during this playoff run has been huge. They have been phenomenal. They have shown up every single night we've been home and even when we're on the road, we've seen the videos of families, fans, walking the streets, banging pots and pans every time we win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,It's pretty special to feel that love from them and can't wait to play in front of them tomorrow night.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"Keep shooting. I've worked too hard to give up on myself at this point. I've missed a lot of shots in my life and career. I'm not going to let that stop me from shooting and doing what I do. I get paid to do this and I do this for a living. So, I'm going to keep shooting every time I'm open."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"For sure. The way they defend is similar to New York. I think we can still do a better job of attacking, but yeah, I would say it's going to be similar. Similar shots, similar execution on their end of just how they guard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"82 regular game season. We have ran every defense. We have ran every scheme. Spo does a great job preparing us all year to be ready for situations like this, to be able to switch in a timeout, switch a scheme, switch a defense. We have ran every single defense with every single lineup this entire season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"So, it's nothing new to any of us and we are ready to be plugged in at any point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"He just tells me to be me. Love Pat. Love having him around. He's here every single day, and just being able to learn from him. And like you said, he's just been through so much experience in these type of environments, so nothing seems to really faze him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,Just learning from him and watch how he reacts and how he carries himself is enough in itself.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"Not really. Just defending and rebounding is really all he cares about. He's told me to rebound more a couple times, but he lets me play and lets us do our thing and trusts us that with our ability on the court that we are going to do what's best for the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,I wouldn't say I've been impressed. Bam is just being Bam. Bam is an All-Star. Bam is an unbelievable player. One of the best big men in the NBA and we are lucky to have him on our team.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"His ability to guard at that level, one through five, it's special. It's unique and you know, he's been carrying us and he's going to continue to do that and keep playing at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, I think my first day. Just kind of how we go about our business, how they trust in the work, they trust in people preparing themselves and putting in work behind closed doors. That's everything I've done in my career to get to where I am. Continue to work hard through all the ups and downs and keep pushing. That's really it, and they really strive on that here and push you to work harder, and I've just been built like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"So, you know, ever since the first day I got here, I've just felt a special connection and a strong love for this organization."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"I mean, I think we keep backing it up. We keep showing and proving ourselves over and over again. Even when people don't do it themselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"So, we believe in each other. We believe in ourselves, and that's really all that matters to us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I did not see Steve's comments. But I think the context of what you're saying, getting guys to get into roles, buy into something that is bigger than themselves, that's arguably the most important thing when you're trying to build a team that can contend for a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's elusive. It's tough. You try to be intentional about it. You try to get guys that really care about winning more than anything, even if they have to sacrifice, or also understanding that that's a prerequisite, that you have to sacrifice."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have a lot of guys that have played a bunch of different roles, that have excelled in different roles, but have had the emotional stability that when their roles have had to change that they're still about the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In reference to Kyle, he's all about winning. At this stage in his career, when you have more yesterdays than you have tomorrows, it's really about these kind of competitive moments on the biggest stage. That's what drives him more than anything, is the ultimate competition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It was a relatively easy decision to take him off the bench because we had to shut him down for five weeks, and when he came back, he had a minutes restriction that he and I were aware of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The first game he came back I played him 36 minutes, so the head coach got yelled at by everybody. Kyle and I met the next day and we were both laughing about it. We needed to protect each other. The only way to do that was to bring him off the bench so we could control the minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We did that the rest of the year. There was really only about a month left in the season. He excelled in that role.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"By the time we got to the Playoffs, even though he could handle more minutes, we just stayed with it, and really secure with that. I think he has embraced that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Our second unit now is one of our biggest strengths as a team. We were struggling with our second unit for various reasons for most of the season, and he kind of just fixed all that on his own."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's an art, not a science, right? There's no perfect formula to that. There's no perfect boom."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We know our group. They live on the razor's edge. There's an edginess to this group. The ""on"" button is usually on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think we've found better ways, more productive ways in the moments in between just to not exhale, not to relax, but just to recharge, get our minds off of that so that you can gear up the next day emotionally, physically, spiritually, all of those things. It's tough to always be on that ""on"" button."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This group has shown a maturity level to be able to handle both. We'll see tomorrow night. But in a moment like this, yeah, I want our guys relaxing. When we get out of here, I would love for them to get their minds off of it. I know how they all are. They want to be like that all the time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It could be different the next possession. It could be different within the possession. They're probably having similar discussions about our defense. This is that level. It's the Finals. That's what is required.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The guys have really been working diligently, film sessions and in these practices, to try to get on the same page. But they're a very good defense because of their changing coverages."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I don't want to be Nostradamus right now. We're taking it one day at a time. I know that sounds like cliche. He did the practice with the group. He is going to do a full-contact workout after this. We'll evaluate that. We'll meet with the training staff later on today and probably tomorrow, and we'll just continue this process."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He has not been cleared yet, so that's where we are. But we're encouraged by the work that he has been doing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He is a two-way basketball player. He does so many winning things that I think unfortunately when you view maybe a 56-point game, everybody on the outside views that he has to do that every game to impact winning. He understands the levers that contribute to winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He is doing it on both sides of the floor. He has an incredibly tough cover defensively that matters. Then offensively I still just think we have a great place where everybody feels settled. If your role players can step in and start playing great, it's usually because they feel a confidence level from the best players, and that's Jimmy and Bam. They infuse all of our guys to be aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The way they defend, they're prioritizing protecting the paint against him, so he has to make the right reads. Then down the stretch, those were his best moments. That's really key for us when you're in those close games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But whatever, however many points he had in the last six minutes, his fingerprints were all over the game down the stretch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, you know the term when you say your head has to be on a swivel? That's what it has to be. Your head almost has to be able to turn 360 degrees at all times on the weak side, and you can't physically do that, obviously."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That level of discipline and focus is the highest level. That's what he requires your defense to be. Then he can score. He's proven he can score 41 against us, and he scored 50 plus in another playoff game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"You're in the Finals. You're going to be dealing with great players, great teams. You have to find a way to overcome it and make it difficult and do a lot of things that are tough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, Murray is just an electric playoff performer. It's not just Jimmy. Jimmy will shape shift. He is going to be on a lot of different guys in this series. That's just the way it goes, and he embraces all of those challenges. He'll be on 1 through 5 at some point. Murray will draw second defenders, third defenders. You have to pick him up beyond the three-point line. He's ignitable, as we saw in that fourth quarter. He can do it a lot of different ways against a lot of different coverages."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,So you have to have some strong habits that you've developed over the course of the season.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, the combination of that and just how much attention he attracts makes him really hard to game plan for, and obviously a lot of us are beneficiaries of that, just with how unselfish he is out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"That's probably a better question for him than it is me. You know, I think there's probably some differences. I'm sure he would probably feel it more than we would. But you know, at the same time, regardless of what the coverage is, we expect him to be aggressive and put pressure on the rim and create opportunities for himself and others."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think first and foremost, being process driven, just trying to generate good shots and not being so caught up in the results of whether the ball goes in or not. If we move the ball, create advantages and play unselfishly and find others, then usually it bodes pretty well for us regardless if the ball goes in or not."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think we have proven throughout the playoffs that we can win in different ways. It's not just through making shots. Just that versatility, also, gives us some peace of mind in that sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,Similar to Game 1 in that we did some things that were encouraging but some things that we have to shore up. It's about being able to adjust and continue to improve throughout the series.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, you know, on that one in particular, just got the switch and then found like a little soft spot in the defense. So yeah, just try to be aggressive. Man, honestly that game, just trying to have my presence felt, particularly in the fourth quarter because until that point, I really had not had much of an impact. Just trying to be an offensive spark and provide a little bit of light."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think first and foremost, just belief in yourself and this group, and then also just with your preparation, putting the work in, knowing that you're prepared for opportunities, and you know, you can't always control if the shots go in or not but you can control how you prepare and get ready for the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Mentality is the same. I've seen a lot of defenders throughout my career. Jimmy is a good defender. Got great hands, anticipation. Obviously, he is a little taller than me. I'm not going to tell you how to beat it, but I've got my ways smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,Just got to keep him guessing and keep him working. Just because he is on me doesn't mean I can't be a part of the play or not put pressure on the defense. I thought I had some really good looks throughout the game just missed them. That's all I've got.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it helps a lot. Jeff took us to a team dinner last night at his house, all the way out in Narnia. But it was a good vibe just to have everybody there, forgetting about the last game, knowing that we're here as a team, as a family, trying to accomplish something. It means a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"A lot of it is mentality for me. I just like to keep the right mindset. So when everybody is in a good spirit, and even coming off a loss, I think that's huge. So shout-out to Jeff for getting that team activity together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"And everybody in film, I think Coach did a good job of making everybody speak up and give their own thoughts, and if we disagree, we can talk it out. I think it was a positive -- it's been a positive since the loss."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. Well, if you watch the first quarter, first three minutes of the first quarter last game, it was all our mistakes. If they go small-small, we didn't switch it and led to an open three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it happened twice. They got two threes, and then I think Gabe hit a pull-up between me and KCP and we didn't switch. Those are all our mistakes. Those are all our doings."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"As bad as we played in the first quarter, we're down three at the end of it. As bad as we played to start the third, we were up by a little bit. It's just putting together 48 minutes. It has nothing to do with tightness."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"We're not playing well and we were still in control of the game, it felt like. We've just got to be able to put together 48 minutes and trust each other down the stretch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I mean, making shots is one. I thought my aggressiveness -- aggressiveness is not just shooting the ball. If I'm getting downhill and making the pass to another guy that is open, that is me being aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Some games call for different types of plays. I remember the Lakers series was up and down. Guys were running around, guys were flying off stops. Phoenix, both teams were running and gunning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"This series is more of an execution defensive game. We've got to stay spaced and stay organized and be more deliberate in our offense and in our defense, what we're trying to take away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a team sport. It's not really about me. But I was aggressive in making my drives and making my reads off rebounds, pushing the ball in transition. So just picking my spots and not forcing. I thought I had some good looks that didn't go down."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"But like I said, we could have played a lot better. We could have played a lot better and got the job done. We just had some lapses that we had to come back from, and that didn't help us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Keep shooting. I'm going to keep running plays for him, especially during the the game so he can see one go in. We want him to keep shooting and play aggressive. Not just shoot the ball, but be aggressive. If it's not there, go to the rim. If the pass is open, pass it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,I think he'll be fine. Mike is a next-shot mentality kind of guy. I think he'll be fine. I'll find a way to get him going in Game 3.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Probably just talking to my family, just realizing where we came from and how much work it took to get here. Just realizing the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'd probably say my family, my dad, all my friends back home, everybody supporting from my hometown especially, a small place called Kitchener. Just to take advantage of the opportunity -- that this is something personally I've been dreaming about as a kid. I will say that was the one that has resonated the most, and realizing the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"We've always been a resilient team. We've always had that. We've always had that chemistry. That's one of our biggest advantages is our chemistry and how long we've been playing together, the continuity that we have, the reads that we make on the fly, no matter what the defense is doing. I would say just as long as we stay together and have that bounce-back mentality, we'll be fine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"We've been in positions like this before. This is the first loss in seven games, I think. So we're not doing a bad job. We've just got to refocus, sharpen our mentality and like I said, be more deliberate on both ends of the floor, and we'll be fine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"That he's just proud. He's proud of the way we've been playing, the way we've been sticking with it through the regular season. He's real positive, man. He's just proud of the way that we're playing right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, they complement each other very well. They are both three-level scorers. They can both use the pick-and-roll. One setting it, one coming off of it, vice versa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me. But to my teammates and the fans there, they're getting a big-time player and even better person. Just somebody who is going to bring it every day, push the people around me. Just someone that is going to work hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really proud of what our owners -- this is something, the owners actually appoint and pay the coaches, that our owners have stepped up to do. I think it's something we have our eye on, we had our eye on as soon as I came into the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sport is something that always in Serbia was something that put in front of us everybody, even like 10, 20 years ago, whatever, but now when we have Djokovic who won, probably the best ever. For us he's the best ever of course, and now we have our NBA championship, and I think it's a really good moment to be a Serbian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,It's like four or five.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day. Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career. I'm not worried about this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think as a group, I think we've found ways that we've gotten great looks. I think we've found a little bit of a rhythm offensively. We haven't made all the shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,Also just taking our time and trying to get this win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the moment, it's us, our coaching staff, our players. But this was for all Nuggets. That was what was really cool about it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I wouldn't say that it was a lineup change. I get what you're saying. We just went back to our original lineup. We went with this lineup for 14 games. I didn't have the foresight, I didn't. That's on me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I've heard that. Yeah, I don't know. Just my father's last name, as well. I don't know. I guess I've got like H's in my family or something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just an amazing duo. They've been together for the longest, and just how comfortable they are with each other and how they know each other's tendencies and what works for them and us as a team. It was just truly amazing to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"That's three 6'9"", 6'10"", 6'11"" guys who can dribble, pass and shoot, have high II think that's going to be a huge advantage for us and a struggle for other teams to game plan for."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"Yeah, super, super looking forward to it. Super excited about, just playing in the league in general. Just super excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, we have player personnel sheets and booklets essentially that we can go through and study players' tendencies, what their strengths are, what they like to get to, how they're most effective. Then I just kind of go through that, treat it like a Bible for the next couple of days and just stick to the script."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"For sure. It's something I take pride in, the defensive end. Having that opportunity, having that role, is something I'm really looking forward to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I think it's a standard that we hold ourselves to and that we have held ourselves to all year long. We've been building habits day in and day out. So, you get to a game like this, the biggest stage in basketball, you let your standard of play and you let your habits carry you."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I had a feeling from the information I was being told is that it was just kind of up in the air. Orlando wasn't really sure yet, and just to be ready for whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, to be honest, it's something that -- since year one, whoever was kind of speaking my language or I'm trying to kind of stay in touch or whatever, some guys maybe a little bit more, some guys a little bit less, but I'm trying to stay in touch with everybody."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, I think I knew the Fever were interested, but you never know until draft night obviously happens. I wasn't getting my hopes up or anything like that. Was just keeping an open mind."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We decided that given that investigation was ongoing and it remains ongoing, that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to work in these Finals. I don't know what the ultimate conclusion will be. We'll see where the facts take us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, I think that's -- Nikola never tries to impose his will or force things that aren't there. He's going to read the game. He's going to make the right play. Most importantly he's going to make every one of his teammates better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I think defensively he is definitely one of the best defenders out there. I credit that to his IQ but also his activeness with his hands.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think it's an opportunity to learn. You watch the film, go to school on it, try to take away some things that you did well, and then certainly learn from some things that you can do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, it seems like they've prioritized that, just maybe helping a little bit less on drives and staying home a little bit more. So it's an adjustment. It's something that we're used to and we feel like we can still generate good three-point looks. It's just going to be a matter of running good, crisp offense with pace, full court and half court, and then just playing to our strengths."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I really haven't thought about free agency at all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, there's lots of moments, kind of when there's a pause in the action, I guess, if you will, to kind of step back and be appreciative of the journey. When you're in it throughout the day to day, you're just focused on what's next. Obviously your perspective shifts and changes as you advance in your career and you want more for yourself, because we're all competitive people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Sometimes a dream is deferred, and our dream was deferred for a few years, but we stuck with it, and we added the right pieces. Huge shoutout to Calvin Booth and the job he's done. This is just an unbelievable feeling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,P-Wat has a great feel for the game and a chance to be a really great player for this team and to help this team along the way. I'm excited for P-Wat and the experience that he has gathered thus far.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Just enjoying and embracing this moment, I think that was the biggest lesson. I feel like I truly embraced it. I was very excited just to see my name pop up. It didn't matter if it was first round, second round. I'm just excited to be here. I know they're going to be always around me. I'm always going to be part of the Huskies family. I can always go talk to coaches, call them whenever, even the alums. It's just a big family. So it's nice to have them as my support group that I can always go to and ask questions about the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, when you play a team numerous times in a row, you've got to know what's coming. They know what we're doing, we know what they're doing. We're going to keep adjusting, mixing things up, but everybody is -- he's locked in. KCP is -- it's a defensive game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Not too much. The main focus through this pre-draft process was everything on the court. That's what it's always going to be for me, just keeping the main thing the main thing. But obviously there's stuff to talk about off the court. So later on the road, obviously. But as of now, I'm excited to get out there tomorrow. I can't really put into words how I'm really feeling about it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Tim Connelly hired me and brought me to the table here, and my countless conversations in my seven years with Tim, we would always talk about how we had the luxury of working for a group with Stan and Josh and the Kroenke family that is not going to be just a quick trigger. We have to make a move. We have to make a move. They were willing to take a step back and see this thing through."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and all of our head and assistant coaches, I'd like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, John Hareas, Mike Levine, Mark Broussard and so many people at the NBA, and for all the league support and assistance in providing this tremendous platform for our great coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Everything, man. We were there I think for five days. We saw Christ the Redeemer, we went to different beaches, different places to eat, as well as seeing all the basketball fans over there and how the game has grown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"So really excited to be drafted, excited to get to Dallas and get into training camp."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Las Vegas tell us that we were underdog before. That doesn't... It's not correct, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,The day I walked through the doors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Nah. I had one of my high school teammates who played for the Heat at the time, so I saw him a lot. But other than that, no."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with. So I'm fortunate enough to be able to be the one right now that's in the limelight, to be able to represent our area the best I can, and I look forward to being able to represent Miami, as well, and trying to get this title."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well."
