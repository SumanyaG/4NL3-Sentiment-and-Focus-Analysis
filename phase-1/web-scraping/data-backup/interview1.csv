2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I started off just being an athletic girl, wanting to play hard, run around. Had a high motor. That kind of took me pretty far. I realized that that was something that was going to get me on the court, doing those little things, taking charges."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Then once I got to high school, my coach told me if you can guard multiple positions, you know you're going to play. So I think I carried that with me all the time. As I got into college, I started to watch film. I started to watch my opponents and learn different defensive schemes and all that stuff."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's been a journey, but it's been a great journey."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I actually am from New York, so I used to go to Liberty games growing up. I was a ball girl a couple times. I've been around the W for a little bit."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So being able to purchase tickets to sit front row, seeing that, they were giving out free tickets at one point for girls to come in and just have a crowd. To now playing against Iowa and selling out our crowd at home, just to see that evolution and that aspect, and now I haven't been to that many, but I think I went to one of the playoff games with the Liberty last year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just to see that in itself, being a young girl, thinking that the stadium was so huge to coming in there going, you've played in stadiums like this but now it's filled up, it's filled to the top, I think it's great to show people that once you invest in women that they can give back in a lot of ways."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't. I did not envision this, not because I didn't think I was capable but because I didn't know. I think honestly until I was in maybe about ninth grade, my freshman year of high school, I had to learn the path that it took to get to the W. I was around it, but I didn't know the path that it took to get there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Once I learned that these colleges come and you get a free education and you get to experience so many different things -- I've had the opportunity to play on USA teams. So just for me, just understanding everything that comes with it. I didn't expect to be here, but I'm here, and I am so excited that Indiana has taken the opportunity on me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I played with Caitlin when I was at USA for a couple years. So we played together there. But from going against her this year to being able to play with her and also Aliyah Boston, as well, it brings me some comfort, honestly."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Very excited and so proud of what they've done and how they've grown, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, it was definitely a tough decision for me last year, but I told people that I would never trade the decision I made to go to Ohio State. I think it has brought me so much peace in who I have become as a player and the impact that I can make in any program that I choose or organization that I have the opportunity to be a part of."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that mindset and going into Ohio State and coming in and realizing that I can make a little impact, I'm not here to change anything, but I'm just here to sprinkle a little of me in there and try to impact in any way that I can is really helpful."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Then yeah, playing with Caitlin now is honestly really cool. We've had the opportunity, like I said, to have that sold-out crowd at our place and then going to her place and having that last regular-season home game for them. Just having the opportunity to play with her again, it's going to be amazing. She's done so much for the women's game, and I know she has so much more to give to everyone. Just a lot of excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously adaptability is definitely a big thing, being able to go to a different country, adapt to the environment, adapt to the culture. Overseas is definitely a different way to play ball. They play ball pretty differently there. Just having that prior experience. I know there are a lot of people in the W that are from overseas."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that prior experience, even playing with the caliber of players that I played with, I think all in all, everything together has helped me become the player I am today. I'm very hopeful and very confident that it will help me in the W."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I think pro level of play would probably be the best one. It's just pretty different. They're used to playing against grown women. They're used to that physicality. I think all together it has helped me in many facets of the game of basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's really focused on trying to make the team. Obviously that's the first step going into it, and having confidence in myself and trying to make that. If I do, and when I do get the opportunity to play against them, I think it's just going to be such a surreal feeling. I'm there to compete. I'm there to try to make a roster spot. I'm trying to stay in the league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think a lot of it is just excitement, surreal, because I've seen them play. I was younger watching them play. But definitely very competitive and just excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously very, very big defensive-minded kid, but at the same time, I'm willing to do whatever it is that a team needs me to do. I'm willing to come in there and impact. I'm really big on community. So just getting my hand in the community and continuing to be who I am and continuing to make an impact in every stop that I've had."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I didn't have the opportunity to really, really get to know her. When I was recruited by Ohio State coming out of high school, she was there. So I got to see her on my visits a couple times. That was probably the biggest interaction. But very hands on, very big about coming to be a Buckeye."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think it's kind of interesting that that was the school that I was looking at coming out of high school. I ended up finishing my college career there, and now I get to play with a Buckeye. I think that's also going to give me some comfortability. She's a great player and so much I can learn from her. I'm just ready to go in there to work and continue to learn."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's special. I think taking that fifth year was something I thought long and hard about and I'm glad I did. A lot of good things came from it. Obviously having Emmy next to me it makes everything easier and that much more special. She's had a huge impact on me and everyone at Ohio State, and it's been really cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"She's everything to me. She's my why. She's why I do it, why me and my brother work so hard at it. She's special, and I really hope so. I know it'll be a little harder for them to travel, but I feel like absolutely they'll make it to some games."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's a surreal moment because I grew up as a little kid watching all these women play and how talented they are and being able to have a chance to play with them and compete against them, it's a dream. It's what we all are here for, and it's what we're looking forward to."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"I'm excited. I've seen the growth. Everyone has seen the growth, and to be a part of that is something that is really rare, so I'm looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Absolutely. I think that's something that's really big in today's world, especially with our class. It's exciting just to have those opportunities as women athletes. I think that's something that is kind of new to us, and it's exciting and it's absolutely something people should take advantage of. To be honest, I'm just ready to go play ball down there right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I think there's going to be an adjustment period for all of us, whether people want to admit it or not. I'm looking forward to it and welcoming it. As a rookie I think that's something you have to accept and be ready for."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"The pace, the length, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of things that are a little different and it'll take some time to get used to, but I'm welcoming that challenge and looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot. I've gotten to spend some time with some vets the past couple days and they've been really helpful. Just staying confident with who you are and what you do well is something that I took from them just a couple days ago. But I think that's important because when you're good at something, you can excel in that area and really keying in on that and taking that with you to the next level is definitely something I'll take from them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"I'm excited to play with everyone, to be honest on that team. Like I said, I grew up watching them, and I think being able to play with them now and getting that opportunity is something that, like I said, was a dream. They're a really talented group, and I know they're going to push me day one when I get there, so I'm excited for that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Competing really against everyone. The league is -- the talent, you guys have seen it and it's no joke and it's something I'm looking forward to and excited for, and like I said, there will be an adjustment, but I'm super excited."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I was there for a minute and I got to experience Buckeye Nation and just staying in Ohio, which was amazing. I think just the way we represented that university and the way they're going to continue to, it's an honor to put on that jersey every day, it's an honor to play in front of Buckeye Nation every night. I just hope that we left a legacy of hard work going out there every night and giving it our all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"As far as representing the university and our fans, I hope we made them proud."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My conversations were great with T Spoon. As you know, she was coached by Coach Mulkey, so I kind of thought maybe I'll go there. Knowing like the conversations were so good and she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a Black woman and as a head coach, and everything she's done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Jeff Pagliocca, the GM, was amazing, too, and player development is something that I was looking for and they looked for in me. I'm super excited for this move, and I'm just looking forward to getting to Chicago."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My first time playing Kamilla was on one of the biggest stages in my life, when she played for Hamilton Heights and I played for St. Frances in high school and we battled. Now being able to be teammates is going to be amazing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I actually talked to her earlier, was congratulating her. I know she came off an amazing run, an amazing college career. I'm looking forward to playing with her in practice and in games, just bouncing off of each other. So I'm excited for this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,I don't know. I don't know what movie right now. I don't know what movie right now.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Ooh, summertime Chi-town. To be cute on and off the court. I've always been to Chicago. The shopping is great. Just the lifestyle. I'm excited. I feel like I'm a Chi-town girl."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,Something Megan Thee Stallion. I love Megan Thee Stallion. Megan Thee Stallion or Beyonce.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I have had so many people reach out to me from so many different places. Understanding our impact isn't just within our school, within just the U.S., but it's worldwide. It's amazing to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Going out of the country when we go out of the country with my team, with LSU, it was like so much fun because they all recognized us and they knew us and it felt like home. I feel like anywhere we all go, and this draft class is amazing, anywhere we go, we're known. This is super cool because women aren't usually recognized around the world like how we are, and it's not even just basketball. It's the impact we've left on people's lives outside of there. It's super cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I think our duo, me and Kamilla versus Cam and Rickea is going to be cool to see. That's going to be fun."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Just be you. A lot of people may just tell you that you can't do certain things, and you're going to get more yeses and nos, and I had to realize that. Just being able to be authentic, and people love me because of who I am. I had those tough conversations. I say things that a lot of people are scared to say, and take that scary step. I took a scary step of faith going to LSU, not knowing what could happen, and look how my life has completely changed."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Being able to just believe in yourself, trust in yourself and have an amazing team behind me is great."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I mean, I didn't know what I was going to do. Obviously coming back would have been amazing for me, but I wanted more for myself. I wanted to start over. I feel like I had been at a high since the National Championship, and I want to hit rock bottom. I want to be a rookie again. I want to be knocked down by vets, and I want to be able to get up and grow and be a sponge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I'm just super excited to play with the amazing players and against amazing players. This league is really competitive and I'm a competitive player, so I want to play against a lot of great players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Well, my mom was crying before the show even started, so it started there. Then my brother was like agitating me, I bet you 100 that you cry, I bet you 100 that you cry. He kind of got me, too. And I had a great conversation, like she was saying, with Chicago, so I kind of knew -- if it wasn't the Mystics, I knew it was going to be Chicago that was going to be calling me home."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"It means everything. I mean, like I said, on and off the court, we're amazing. We're not just basketball players, we're super impactful to the community, the people around us, the little kids that look up to us, and being able to also be nationwide, everybody knows us everywhere we go. Our lives aren't normal. We might get a little bit of normalcy going into the league now, but I'm just excited to be a trailblazer. I'm excited to be a part of history, and just continue to see the future, and I know it's bright."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, it's huge. Obviously traveling from the other side of the world or from Australia, it's a lot. Like I'm still jet-lagged and everything. I've still got emotions running through and I can barely sleep. But it's great."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"It's great to just look back, knowing that my country back home, my family and my friends they're all proud of me and they're all supporting me, watching me, especially my mom. She's done so much for me, my family and stuff, making sacrifices for us. Growing up I didn't come from a big basketball sporty world, and just played it because I loved it and my siblings played it, and then to get where I am now, it's incredible."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Obviously being in Australia, it's a bit difficult to watch the games and get to it and stuff, but I think as the years progressed, we started getting to know the game a bit more and obviously it's like a little sisterhood. We've got the WNBL now on our side and we've got the WNBA, so you get to know about it. And we've got Australians and grads that play in the WNBA, as well, so then you get to study that, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, well, growing up in juniors, I'd always be the scorer, attacking the rim, being an offensive player and stuff. But as I headed into the pro league, being young, there's already people doing all that. You have to make sacrifices. You need to learn the game a bit more, learn your other strengths. For me, it was defense. My length, being able to guard different positions, different players, being able to switch on to different people and just using my length, my ability, my quickness to kind of get around people."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"For me, I think when I play defense and I play great defense, it brings my offense naturally. So it's like, it just comes to me, and I don't have to force anything. So that's probably why I do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm very excited. Obviously playing in a different league and then coming into another one is great. The lifestyle, the people you play against, what we learn in the game here is obviously a bit different, so getting to learn that, playing against people, taking things from them, what I can add into my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"All of them. All the WNBA players. It's so different back home. Again, like in the WBNL we do have imports that come and play, we had Tiffany Mitchell, Jordin Canada and being able to play against them and with them is huge, no matter whether they're guards or bigs, just playing against all of them and seeing the differences in how they all play and just -- yeah."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's amazing. Like I haven't been there before, but stories, everything I've heard about it, we've got fellow Aussies over there, as well. We've got Paul Goriss that's also there, as well, and he's been good to me, as well. He's talked to me then and there. He's been texting me and stuff, and Kristy Wallace. She's amazing, as well, on the court and off the court, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"But I think just getting to know everyone, getting the experience, the new lifestyle and just -- as well as the coaches and the staff and everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's cool. It's amazing seeing fellow Australians in the WNBA, and they're achieving what you're achieving, as well. It's a privilege, honestly. It's such a great thing, and it's like -- I feel like it's just good that people can look at it and be like, wow, these Australians can play because I feel like that's one thing we don't really get sometimes, and we've had people like Lauren Jackson providing that for us."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I hope one day we can leave that kind of legacy to younger kids and everyone, as well, in this generation, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm not really having any expectations. Just going in there with an open mind, making sacrifices. It's going to be hard. I'm young. They're great professional players, talented athletes. It's going to be hard, and I'm coming from a different country, different environment and a new lifestyle."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Just taking it day by day, learning experience, talking to the vets, talking to everyone around there and just building that on to my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I think it's great because I could do both, and either spot they need me to play that I could just sharpen in that area and get really good and just excel."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I think that I just bring versatility and just a physicality to the game of basketball, and so that's what mostly they'll be seeing from me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think just my teammates and how much time we spent together. I think that's something I'll miss, all the memories and things like that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Definitely the community in Salt Lake City. I think it's really grown on me the last two years I was there, and I'm going to miss it a lot because even though I came from another Pac-12 school, they still took me with open arms and just supported me throughout everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,I'm just looking forward to just starting this new journey and hopefully having a great rookie season.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,Just that I'm a humble person and somebody who is really for the community and just loves to represent my people. I think I just especially this year just try to tap into representing my culture and just being that inspiration for young kids who look like me and are of my same background.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I just think that impact is something that I'll carry with me to the WNBA, and I just hope that's what people see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I have a little bit. Gianna and Jenna have talked about Minnesota a lot and just how it is a very basketball-oriented state, and there's been so much rich culture of that there. So I'm excited to see it and experience it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think they'll just get somebody who's a competitor and somebody who has a unique style of play and is just fun to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,I'm very excited to just be able to play at the next stage and kind of just improve in areas that I need to to really excel at the next level.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, growing up in Alaska was great. I would say I loved my childhood. It was just so much fun, camping, fishing, doing a bunch of outdoor stuff, and it's a beautiful state. The only problem I think was just the isolation it had from the rest of the world, and how much it lacked exposure and just sports and things like that. But I wouldn't have had it any other way. I loved my state and carry that with a lot of pride."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I know going to Minnesota the cold probably won't bother me since I'm used to that, but I'm excited to be in a new environment and place."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"The football question, that's just played a big part in my life, I think, just kind of building up the physicality I played with. It's helped me a lot with that. Just having an older brother, he plays for the Dolphins now, just kind of looking back on it, how we were literally on the same team and competing against each other, it's cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"We're both very fortunate to be doing what we love at the highest level, and it's just a blessing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, first, I'm super excited to be drafted to Phoenix. I know they have some really amazing players there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"But yeah, I think I'm super motivated. Obviously since being a kid I've always wanted to play in the WNBA. To have this opportunity means the absolute world to me, and I'm just excited to go out to Phoenix and get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I'll definitely miss the people. I love my teammates, my coaches and the staff around there, and them helping me so much. I know that in the dub I'll be a little bit more independent, so I'll probably miss the extra help of people telling me what to do. But I'm excited for what's next."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I know at some point I have to grow up, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think it really was. I think I learned so much about myself as a player and especially as a leader. We had a really young team this past year, and I felt like I was able to grow my game and my leadership. I loved playing with my teammates and they always challenged me to be better, but I definitely think any leadership. I used to be so shy as a kid, so to see where I am now, I'm just so proud of that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I'm so excited to learn from both of them. Obviously they have a lot of great guards there, and Diana Taurasi is like the GOAT of basketball, so to be able to learn from her is going to be so fun and I can't wait for that. Natasha Cloud, I love her energy. I love when she used to play for Mystics and she was so fun to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,It's kind of unreal to be able to say that like I'm going to be teammates with Diana Taurasi and Natasha Cloud.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think going in the third round, that's just a number, and I think I'm just going to go out there and do my best and show what I can. I'm really confident in my skills and my abilities. Obviously, I've earned this moment to be here."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"So I think, like I said, that's just a number, and I'll go out there and try my hardest and make the team."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,All the flavors tonight. All the flavors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I think I was just nervous the entire night, so the feelings didn't really change. I was pretty much nervous. But I know when I heard my name, I was just so excited, and I can't wait to get to work in Phoenix."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I mean, if you saw my face, I don't think anything was going through my head at the moment. I was so positively overwhelmed, and just having all of them around me, all my people in the stands, at the table, knowing that my family, my friends from back home are watching, it's surreal. It's why I'm here. Without them, I would never be here sitting and answering your questions."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I owe everything to them, and I'm just truly blessed and so grateful for Seattle to give me this opportunity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Thank you for your question. I love Sue. I love her so much. I remember watching her when I was a kid, trying to mimic her moves. Being at UConn after her has been a huge deal for me. Very, very humbling experience. She's one of the greatest."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"To be able to have this opportunity again, I mean, it's a full-circle moment for me. I can't believe it. It's got to be some higher power, something else going on, because I have no words for this. It's a full-circle moment for me, and I'm just so blessed."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I honestly have no idea about the jersey number. That's honestly the least thing on my mind. That's not what I'm thinking about, but when I find out, I'll find you and tell you first."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. I feel like going back to when I had to make my college decision, UConn was a challenge, especially coming in with my class, Paige Bueckers, No. 1 player in the country, that was a huge challenge, but I took it. I feel like it paid off, and that's one decision that I'm so happy and proud that I made in my life because all of that led to this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to your question, I feel like first and foremost, I obviously -- their roster, just looking at it, those are some iconic women. Those are some iconic basketball players, people that I want to learn from, that I want to listen to, that I want to get challenged by, that I want to get yelled at, everything, all of the above. I'm ready for it, and I feel like it's kind of like a similar thing for me going to UConn and going to this place. Obviously, this is the next level."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But I feel the same. I feel eager to learn. I feel eager to be challenged and eager to fail and rise up, and I feel like that coaching staff and that team will do it for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"The one thing that I want to bring is being a good teammate. I want to create amazing relationships over there. I feel like that's what makes and helps teams win, and I want to be a part of that winning program because it truly is a historic winning program."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Well, first and foremost, I feel like this was something that I didn't even dare to dream about, if I can say it that way. I always felt like it was such a reach. It was something far more beyond me and bigger than me. But luckily I had people around me, my teammates, my friends, my family, my coaches, everybody that made me believe in it, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I always trust my work ethic. I feel like that's my best asset, how hard I work, how I don't give up, how I learn from my mistakes."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Obviously I'm going to fail, and that's fine. But it's how you react to it. I'm ready for all the challenges. I'm ready for whatever is thrown my way. But I know I'm going to respond in a positive way and how a true competitor does."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. Thank you for the question. I feel like as you grow, you learn and you mature. When I came in as a freshman, I didn't understand that you don't have to be in the gym all day. It's how hard you work for those 45 minutes, those 20 minutes, and how consistent you are with it. I feel how my coaching staff, especially Morgan Valley, my coach, she kind of helped me guide me through that. This last, my senior year, I spent 25 minutes before every single practice, even on the days that I didn't feel like it, even on the days that I was tired, and shot threes and shot mid-ranges."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"That 40 percent that you mentioned is purely the testament to my hard work and dedication and her being in that gym with me every time. I'm so grateful to her. But I'm also very proud of myself and how I just remained consistent and proved to myself that consistency is the key, because hard work I already have it. Consistency was the key for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yes, thank you. I feel like us UConn players, we're a family. It doesn't matter if we played 30, 20, 10 years ago or even before that, or you're playing right now or you are going to play in the future. Everybody is connected. That's what the coaching staff does a great job of, creating that family atmosphere, that strong bond and connection that lasts forever."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"That's how it is with Sue. She's been over to UConn so many times, whether that's like fun stuff or coming to watch our games or trying to help us and guide us and give us advice, because we all truly look up to her a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I mean, I'll say it again, it's a full-circle moment for me. All the things that kind of led up to this, it's crazy. I can't believe it. But I'm just super grateful and I can't wait to see her. I'm sure she's going to be of a great help, and my mentor and somebody that's going to guide me, and I want that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to your other question. Absolutely, Nneka, Skylar, those women are incredible, on and off the court. I can't wait to learn from them, and of course I watched them. Skylar, I watched her so much. Nneka, I mean, she hugged me and I almost passed out over there. And obviously the rest of the team. When you look at the names, what they've done -- I always go back to not just on the court but off the court with the influence that they have. I can't wait to be a part of that. I can't wait to learn. I can't wait to just listen and sit back and try to get everything I can from such influential, iconic women. I'm super, super excited. I can't wait to meet all of them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, I mean, that's a funny question because growing up, I didn't really have the opportunity to watch WNBA games. Even now in Croatia, people have to find their ways to watch those games. I feel like what I remember, I would sit in my living room with YouTube and find games or highlights or anything that I can. I remember watching Brittney Griner in my living room. It's just those little things that stick with me. But it was hard to find places and ways to watch these women."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I feel like seeing now especially with this draft class that I'm a part of, amazing athletes, amazing people that brought women's basketball to another level, and I always say, all the players before us that paved the way for us, they deserve their flowers, and they deserve to be recognized. I feel like we're moving toward that direction, and I never think it's too late. I always think there's time to be better and improve and grow, and I feel like we're on the right track."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, Aaliyah has been there from the start. That's my sister. That's my family. I met her even before we both committed to UConn. Can you guys believe how full circle -- it's so many full-circle moments I can't even fathom right now. We met before at NBA Academy, BWB, and I loved her instantly. Our bond is strong. We don't need no words. You can feel it. You can feel the energy. To be able to here with her and share this has been nothing but incredible, and something that I'll remember for the rest of my life because it would not be the same if she wasn't here with me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I'm so proud of her. She's going to do amazing. She's going to do great. Everything that she did, she deserves. She put her head down and she worked. Even without all the recognition that she did deserve but she didn't get at times, she didn't care. She put her head down and she knew that something great will happen, and it did tonight. I'm so happy for her."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to the other question, Paige, Azzi, Aubrey, Caroline, all my teammates watching at home, I love them so much. I owe them everything, and I can't wait for my younger teammates and everybody that's coming back next year to have this moment, too, because I know they will. I'll be proudly watching and cheering for them, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,I'm just so grateful to be able to call them my sisters and my family and have such great support even though I'm not home. This is my home away from home. They are my home away from home.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yes, absolutely. I feel like I couldn't get more prepared than being at UConn, surrounded by all the coaches, but especially Coach. He's just a legend. When UConn called, I couldn't say no. That was the opportunity of a lifetime for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,Every single thing in that culture that he built in that program aligns with me and who I am as a person and who I strive to be and get better at being.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But just the things I went through with him is so much, and he's my best friend. He's not just my coach, he's my best friend. He's been there from the start. When I failed, through the worst things, through the best things, he always stuck by my side and never left. I'll cherish that bond and that relationship that I have with him forever."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I'm so grateful and happy that he was there tonight, along with all my coaches, at the table and in the audience. They prepared me. They pushed me. They cussed me out when they had to. They yelled at me when they had to. They praised me when they had to. They just did everything right."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"So grateful because not just as a basketball player they have changed me, but they changed who I am as a person. They made me a better person and they make me want to be even better. I'm grateful for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I think my emotions have been so up and down over the last six weeks. I had different expectations in February than I did at the end of March. I think I've been dealt with what I've been dealt with, and the only way to really move on is to have a positive outlook."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Honestly, I'm so excited for the fit. I'm really excited for Vegas. I think that's really promising. To be able to learn from the people at Vegas for the next year, what more could you ask for? If I'm not able to play on the court, I know that I'll be able to benefit mentally and emotionally just by observing what they have there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I'm really excited, and that's my No. 1 emotion right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Well, they're always there for me, first of all, no matter if I go out and have 25 in a game or if I can't play. I know they're going to be at the game. They're going to be the first ones hugging me afterward. That support has meant the world to me over the last 15 years that I've been playing basketball or sports at all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"For them to be able to be here with me on draft night, my family, my sister, my parents, it means everything to me. It's not just a testament to what I've been able to do but how they've been able to help me get here."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I didn't start playing basketball super seriously until probably middle of high school, so I wasn't exposed to it super early. But I also think the media didn't push it as much. Even though I played basketball in high school, it wasn't necessarily something that was super popular in the media."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"But I'm super excited for it to be taking that trajectory. The class that I'm in right now has done an incredible job to bringing attention to women's sports, women's basketball, and now taking it into this league I think is super exciting."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I think we're already seeing the impact of that on little girls. I think they're way more aware of it than I was at that age, and that's super exciting. I think with expansion coming up and all that stuff, it's headed toward a really good place. I'm really excited to be a part of it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, honestly I'm thrilled. I can't think of a better situation to be in with the situation that my leg is in, because it's just an incredible fit. I think their resources are amazing, their facilities are awesome. To be able to look up to the players there, to be able to watch A'ja Wilson, even though I can't play, I know I'll be able to learn so much and get better just by watching and being around the culture that's there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"That means everything. Those five years at Virginia Tech were so, so special. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The people I had around there, the teammates, the coaches, they were just incredible. They made me who I was. For me to bring that attention to Virginia Tech, to take it to a Final Four, win ACC championships, was just so fun. For them to recognize me I think is really, really cool, but it's also just making me really proud of the program that we were able to create there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I was just able to talk to Coach Becky Hammon a little bit. Obviously there's a little bit more to be figured out, but she spoke about the medical staff there and just working on getting me out there, so we can see where I am and start taking those steps to get me back on the court again because obviously that's the ultimate goal."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"But I'm super excited. I think seriously it's a great fit for all of those things. I know that they'll support me, and we'll all have the same goal of getting me healthy and helping to contribute. We'll take it day by day but with that in mind for next year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah. I mean, he's taught me everything I know. I didn't come into college expected to be anything really. I really didn't take basketball super, super seriously. I thought I wanted to play softball when I was little in college. He completely changed my perspective on that. He made me fall in love with the game to the point where you couldn't get the two of us out of the gym together. We just love spending time with each other in there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm looking into them pouring into me, and I'm doing the same on and off the court."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"I'm so excited to play with Cam. We're both competitive. We're young. We're feisty but we're still going to bring that game offensively and defensively. I know if I get beat off the dribble, Cam is swatting into the second row. So I'm ready for that, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm excited to bring my versatility, play at any position, taking advantage of whether it's a small guard on me or bigger or slower player. I'm excited about that. Then I just want to work on getting in tip-top shape after the injury. My conditioning was in the game trying to get back. I feel like when I'm in tip-top shape, world-class shape, that's when I'm playing my best both ends of the floor."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm definitely excited. I'm just grateful that L.A. believed in me. They see something in me, and I see something in them, too. I had great talks with them prior to the draft, so I'm just grateful for it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Playing at Tennessee and Mississippi State, it's prepared me for this moment because life is just trials and tribulations, but how you get through those, and I feel like I've overcome a lot of adversity. I've continued to stay strong, and that's what got me to where I am today."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, it's crazy to say, but I didn't even think about how the draft process goes. I thought you just show up to draft day and you kind of get drafted. I didn't know if they even speak to you prior to the draft. Really crazy of me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'll answer your second question first. Definitely. This is generational class. I feel like this class is just so different. I know this class is different. I feel like the viewership is peaking. Women's basketball is on an uproar. Everybody is tuning in. We averaged better than the men this year. Not to say we're in competition, but that just says a lot. I'm grateful to be a part of this draft class. I feel like we're just trending in the right direction."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Probably the pace of the game. I feel like high school to college, it was a different pace, so I feel like it's probably going to be that same thing in the league, going up against the world's best players. I feel like that's going to be pretty tough. But I'm excited for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, to be in the conversation with those greats is so crazy and mind blowing to me. I'm just grateful to have Candace come to our games sometimes, have Tamika Catchings, have Jordan Horston in my ear, and they continue to support me. Jordan texted me how much she was proud of me, texted me a little bit about the process. Tamika and I speak every now and then. She's just always pouring into me. I just call her my big sister. Just to have that contact with a Tamika Catchings, it's like, whoa."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"She doesn't even know it, but when she came to our practice and she was acting like she knew me, you don't even know but I was over here like, girl, you're Tamika Catchings. That was pretty cool to experience, though."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"I would give her advice of just be true to who you are. Problems are going to come, challenges are going to come, but the way that you handle it is what builds character. I feel like there's always a light at the end of the tunnel and just continue to just push, push, push. If she plays basketball, I would say repetition is everything. Get the fundamentals down, just work on the little things before -- this generation is a little more flashy, but the fundamentals are everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, growing up I didn't like basketball at all. I just wanted to do girly stuff. I just wanted to be a ballerina and cheerleader. I didn't watch basketball growing up. But once I picked up a ball and I started to see how serious this could go, I really started tuning in a lot. I watched every WNBA basketball game. Even if I can't, I record it and then I'd go back and watch it. I don't look at the score because I like to feel like it's still live. I like that excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Just L.A. as a whole, I know they weren't where they wanted to be. Championships, everyone wants a championship. I feel like I'm just excited to be a part of this journey. I feel like we're going to be really good, just looking at the roster itself. I'm just excited. I've watched them play, so I'm kind of familiar of how they like to play, their style of play."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"So that's pretty cool, and I feel like I'm going to fit in really well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yes, I'm so excited to play with Zia. It's so full circle. We grew up knowing each other. We played AAU together. We live like an hour away from each other, but that's my best friend, so we're still really close."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,But I feel like basketball is just always bringing us back together in the craziest ways. We took our four visits together coming out of high school. I'm so excited to play with my girl. I feel like this is just going to reconnect us on that deep level again.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm honored, honestly, that she said something like that about Cam and I. I truly believe that, as well. I feel like what Cam and I bring is just foundational, like you said. I feel like we're willing to put in the work. We're willing to do whatever as rookies. So I feel like that's pretty, pretty good, and I'm just excited to get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"It played a big role, knowing that we have a few athletes that have already came out of there, and to be one of them means a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"To know that I'm going to such a special team with quite a few veterans means a lot. It's something like a perfect situation, I'm coming in to learn, and there's a lot to learn from, and like I said, there are a few vets on this squad. So to be able to walk into this situation is kind of perfect for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"The first thing I would say to them is don't allow anyone to dim your light, no matter your size. I've dealt with that all the way up until today, tonight. Other than that, I would say that no matter what happens, if you want to achieve something, you can do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"I want to learn from the vets as much as possible. I want to add a little bit of everything to my game. I want it to expand. I also want my IQ for the game to expand, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"Yes, I can score the ball, but what else are you able to do? I think that with those guards over there, they're going to do a wonderful job of helping me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"I'm very excited. I think that it's a full-circle moment for me. I was nominated for that Becky Hammon point guard award, I believe, three seasons in a row when I was at Buffalo. For me to have not received it and to be drafted by her when the time was right has been a full-circle moment, so I'm ready, and I'm ready to go."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Good evening, everyone. It's great to see you all here. Welcome to the 2024 WNBA Draft presented by State Farm. This honestly is one of, I think, my favorite days of the year. We're thrilled to be at the famed Brooklyn Academy of Music for the first time."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"BAM is actually America's oldest performing arts center, hosting some of the brightest talents across a wide range of concentrations since 1861. Tonight, BAM hosts some of the brightest talents in basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"You all may have noticed the fans coming in tonight, and I know some of you got held up. We apologize. But this is the first time the draft has had fans in attendance since 2016. Tickets sold out in under 30 minutes, and that was before the players declared for this draft. Just another illustration of the passion and excitement surrounding the WNBA right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The next chapter in each player's basketball journey starts tonight. I have the ultimate honor of calling their names and seeing the excitement from them, their families, their friends and team representatives as they take the first step of their professional careers."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is just one ""Welcome to the W"" moment for this class. I spent time with them last night and earlier today at the Empire State Building, which will once again brighten up the skyline with WNBA orange tonight. This is a great group of young women. I also spent some time with their parents last night and today and with their families. I'm so excited to see what they will all bring to this league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Speaking of the 2024 draft class, I would be remiss not to mention the incredible excitement and energy for women's basketball that this group has helped build. Just last week, many of those here with us played in front of the largest broadcast audience in history The national championship peaked at 24 million viewers and was ESPN platforms most-viewed college basketball game, men's or women's, on record. Incredible."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,It's so clear that this draft class is entering the WNBA at an incredible time. We are witnessing a transformational moment in sports that we may not experience for generations. The business transformation -- I know you guys love when I talk about it -- that we've been working so hard at is showing results. Support for the WNBA is continuing to grow. Look at this room. Our sport has never been stronger on the court.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I for one feel incredibly blessed to be part of it and to lead the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the United States that is leading the charge for women's sports. This is a league where -- you all know that cover us year-round -- the talent is exceptional, the rivalries are intense and where you tune in to watch a lot of games of consequence."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We are ready for this moment. We're coming off a record-breaking season that saw the WNBA reach milestones in viewership, fan engagement, attendance, social media and digital engagement on the WNBA app and website. For the second year in a row, we'll be hosting a preseason game in Canada. This year, the L.A. Sparks and the Seattle Storm will face off at Rogers Place in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, on May 5. We air games in over 200 countries and territories. Games like our Canada game show how the league is continuing to expand its global footprint."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The fourth annual Commissioner's Cup will return this time with a new format that we are very excited about. Just remember, this is our fourth annual. Each team will play five Commissioner's Cup games, one against each of its in-conference rivals, all during a two-week period at the beginning of June. The players will compete for a half-million-dollar prize pool, and the league will once again be donating to all of the teams' designated not-for-profit community organizations."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This season in July we'll return to Phoenix for the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game, with the three-time WNBA champion Mercury hosting it for the third time. An even bigger and better WNBA Live fan experience will be back for a third straight year. We're excited for you all to see what we have in store at this year's All-Star Game festivities."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Each year we are seeing more and more brands eager to partner with us. Our partners have shown that they have stepped up for the WNBA, and we are extremely thankful and fortunate to work with brands that are so excited to be a part of moving the league forward. We were just on stage with the State Farm executives who are here in full force as our presenting partner tonight."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Over the past few weeks and months we've announced several partnerships, including with Opill, SKIMS, Peloton, La Crema, Tissot. I've got my Tissot watch on here. We've also renewed partnerships with brands, including Glossier and Amazon, and CBS as media partners."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"WNBA tip-off 2024 will again be presented by CarMax, which became a WNBA Changemaker, our elite category of our corporate partners, and our others are ATT, Deloitte, Google, Nike and U.S. Bank. They continue to help us change the game for these players. Our Changemaker partners are a significant driver of our growth, and we are very appreciative of all their support. We look forward to adding more, including another one to be announced as we tip off this season."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our partners are committed to supporting women's sports. We're seeing the work of our broadcast and streaming partners, especially ESPN and ABC. If you build it, they will come. We just proved that in March Madness, and we'll bring that into the WNBA season."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're bringing games to fans where they are, whether they're on national networks, ESPN, ABC, ION, which was our over-the-air partner that we signed last year, streaming on Amazon Prime, ESPN or on our own WNBA League Pass, which last year saw milestone growth for the league. And we're hoping to repeat that this year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The growth and demand for the WNBA had led us to expansion, something that I know you all want to hear about. I've been very excited, as you all know. We announced a team in the Bay Area, with the Golden State Warriors coming in the '25 season. So one year from today, they will be here making a pick. With more news to come in the coming weeks and months on other potential markets to join in 2026 and beyond."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That brings me to women's basketball is not a fad. We've been steadily building this momentum for years, and we are ready for what's next."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Lastly, I have been very reflective over the past couple weeks with all the hype and talk about this draft class and the WNBA. Surviving the existential time of the WNBA wubble, raising that 75 million in capital in February of 2022 as the first women's sports league to do so at that scale, deploying it against our key priorities. Almost as if we knew we had to be ready for this moment, and we are."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, thank you again for all your support. To those that have covered us over time, we thank you for your coverage. And for those of you that are new, to quote from our ad campaign, welcome to the W. We hope you stay."

This is what helps grow our sport, and I know many of you have been with us a long time, through our 27th and soon to be 28th season, and we really do appreciate that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, we'll start our QA portion."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I'll answer the latter first. As many of you know, we already announced that we are providing charter to our players through our full Playoffs, Commissioner's Cup and also the back-to-backs requiring air travel. Why that's important is this year there are a lot more back-to-backs requiring air travel because it's an Olympic year and we have an Olympic break. So we funded out of the league a 4 million fund to fund charter for this year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, as we build the momentum and build the economic model to fund that longer term, there's nobody that wants that more than I do for these players, but we have to be in the right financial position. We're not going to jeopardize the financial viability of this league. It was just a few years ago we were surviving, and now we're going from survive to thrive. So we'll do it at the appropriate time, and we've been chipping away at it every year and adding additional charter flights for the players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Media deal. So speaking of better travel, better pay and all that, sports, especially at league levels, you have two main revenue streams. One is your media rights, and the other is corporate partnerships. We've been really making great progress with the corporate partnership side. On the media side, I think women's media rights have been undervalued for so many years, just a microcosm by the way of the broader world that I came from before I came here. So I think it's really important that we're doing everything we can."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is an important year for us around viewership, around attendance, around all the qualitative and quantitative factors that go into the valuation of media rights, because as I've said to my team, there's not a day that we're not -- if we're not working on things that feed into the valuation of our next media rights, we're not focused on the right things."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is a really important focus for us. Our current deals go through the '25 season. So through October of '25. We do have some time, but we're gearing up for a combination of what that media rights package would look like."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you know, the media landscape continues to be enormously disrupted, with household and people using TV levels down, with obviously cord cutting, with streaming, with over-the-air. Obviously, there's a lot going on subscription-wise, cable. So we're looking at all of that disruption and determining what is the best deals with partners for the WNBA, including, again, traditional linear, streaming and over-the-air."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So first, our plan and goal is to get to 16 teams in the next few years. We're at 13 with the Golden State team. Our plan is to get three more in the next few years."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're talking to a lot of different cities. I think I've thrown out names before. It's complex because you need arena and practice facility and player housing and all the things, you need committed long-term ownership groups. The nice thing is we're getting a lot of calls."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We continue to engage with cities. I'll throw some of those out there because I've already thrown them out there. We continue to engage with cities like Philadelphia and Toronto, and Portland and Denver and Nashville and South Florida and probably forgetting one, but those are the cities we're talking to. But just last week we got calls from two other cities. These can either take a very long time to negotiate or can happen pretty quickly if you find the right ownership group with the right arena situation."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're on our way to 16. That will add 48 roster spots in just a couple of years. That, in a league of 144, is a lot. That's 30 percent. I think it'll be great when we get those done over the next couple years."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"'26 is definitely our goal for certainly the next one, and then shortly thereafter, if not then, or a year or two after. So by '28, I'd say I'd feel pretty confident we'll be at 16 teams."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Expansion draft, again, we're not going to share exact details on the expansion draft today. But it'll happen this year, this calendar year, so probably in December because it has to happen before the college draft. That expansion draft, we'll share more details as we get closer to that. We've been talking with our general managers and head coaches and the teams and the owners, so more to come on that. But there will be an expansion draft this year, and it'll probably be in December."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think what's important is there's a reason the WNBA is the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the country, and it's because the NBA has been such a great partner in launching this league, building this league and investing in this league. So to the extent it makes sense, I think what I heard Adam say, but to the extent it made sense to go to market together, that's what we'll do."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think as you look at streamers who have a subscription model, the WNBA gives the NBA longer programming across the year. I think Adam uses the quote of 320 I actually think it's more days. And there's no other set of two sports leagues that can offer that live programming and sports to a streamer like that. I would say probably in that case we need the NBA because we have a smaller footprint with only 40 games, and it's nice to go to market together."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So where it makes sense to go together, we will. Where it makes sense -- so we have our own deals today that the NBA doesn't have, with Amazon, with CBS and with ION. So where it makes sense not to, we'll evaluate that and work with Adam and his team on that. We're just excited that we have a lot of interest from a lot of media partners in the W. We've got to deliver an amazing season this year in order to get, I think, the right-sized valuation."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think everybody is watching those teams that are investing in the player experience. I'll call it more -- because it is more broad than just practice facility. There's a variety of things in player experience that can attract a player in free agency. And quite frankly, off of our 2020 very progressive and historic collective bargaining agreement, free agency opened up, as you've seen, some really interesting years of free agency that we didn't used to have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think you see that investment. You'll see it pay off. I think there are other owners looking at the exact same thing. We have situations where, again, we have NBA-affiliated teams who already have great practice facilities."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think everybody is looking for an advantage to bring in free agents, because the one thing I know these long-term committed owners in the W are, they want to win a championship. I think practice facilities and other player experience have become very important as you seek free agents in the marketplace."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"See, we're a pretty good vault here at the WNBA. I'm not going to comment on any specific ownership group. We've had several ownership groups in several cities reach out to us. Sometimes in a city, two different ownership groups reach out. Again, we evaluate them through our process. We also evaluate the city, the demographic, the psychographic. That is my hometown, so I happen to know more about that. But we've done a big data exercise in research."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,No specific comment on that specific city other than it's certainly on the list. I think it's a great basketball city. We'll continue to discuss it with ownership groups there that are interested in committing long term to the W.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, the one thing in sports, at the league level we love to bring in these corporate partners because then they can support our players across all of our teams. We've been able to establish that with our current WNBA Changemakers and other partners that aren't Changemakers. We upsell to Changemakers, like we did with CarMax. They were a partner, not a Changemaker, and they came to us and said we want to support the W in a bigger way. So we were able to upsell them, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"There are some open categories we have in a variety of categories. That's how we target who we want to be partners. But we also look at a values match. We also look at -- relationships matter, too. If we have relationships with the CEO or the CMO or someone in the C-suite, that's an important part because then you can turn that into a corporate partnership."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"One of the things that's great about being in the WNBA right now is everybody is paying attention. I ran into someone who ran an ad buy during the final of the women's Final Four. They said -- it was a CEO they got thousands of messages, not only about how great they thought the ad was but that they ran it during women's basketball, and how much that lifted their brand with not just their female employees but their female customers and everybody."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, I think with eyes on the game increasing at historic levels, obviously betting is not legal in every state. Integrity is No. 1 for us, so obviously we do a lot in that area. But certainly from a perspective of bringing in a fan base that might not have been in the WNBA before. We've had plenty of betting on WNBA in past years, but obviously I think FanDuel or one of the betting companies released a statistic about that LSU-Iowa game in the Elite Eight, and it was one of the highest bet games they had seen. I hadn't seen the data post that for the Final Four and the final game, but I'm sure a lot of people are paying attention, transcending age, race, gender from that perspective."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That's what these WNBA players coming into this Draft tonight are going to do for us, and I think the attention and the views and bringing in another part of a fan base that might not have watched women's basketball before and now are following these household names."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The one thing I know about sports, you need household names, rivalries and games of consequence. Those are the three things we've had over the past couple weeks, and hopefully will continue into the WNBA season. Certainly sports betting is something that attracts fans in."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we need to work on this idea of watch and bet versus bet and watch because if you bet, maybe you don't watch, but if you watch and then bet, yeah, then you're probably bringing in a fan base we haven't had before."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Integrity first. Obviously, it's not legal in every state in the U.S.. But as we start to see that -- and betting partners are supporting our teams, as well, in corporate sponsorships. So I think again, it's an important way to grow our viewership."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that -- that's why I started to answer this question with the integrity of the game is No. 1. It will remain No. 1 no matter how the handles grow and things like that. But people are going to bet on our sport, and we do a ton of training from the league, the team perspective. The Players Association I know has a rules of the road around this. I think it is really important."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I was actually talking to the players last night, and I said I learned one thing when I was the CEO of Deloitte about juggling four things in life your work, your health, your family and your integrity. I said, when you juggle those balls, three of those balls are glass and if you drop them, they break, and those are family, health and integrity. The work ball is rubber. You can mess up and recover. But those three balls, so the integrity I think it's really important that the players understand they're big brands with big followership, more than any players have had coming into the league because of the popularity of the women's game at the NCAA level, and how important is integrity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's accomplished by training. Do I worry about things like that? Sure, and everybody should in sports. But I do think it's happening around us, and if we're not cognizant of what's going on and how that can benefit the viewership of the league and things like that, so we don't want to leave that on the table, but we want to do it in the right way with the right guardrails around integrity. We have not, to my knowledge, had issues on that, but we'll continue to monitor it for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, so obviously one of our focuses this year of our social justice council is reproductive rights, as well as civic engagement, given that we're in a general election year. So the one thing I like about our players, our players want to be engaged. They don't run away from things. They want to be engaged and they want to force change in the communities in which they live and work, and they do it very, very effectively. I think on this issue they'll continue to do that effectively."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously we have a team there, as well, and in other states, but they'll continue to make their impact on this particular issue, maternal health, reproductive rights. Actually, the charities that we'll be donating to as part of the Commissioner's Cup will be charities in that space, and the players, again, will use their voice because they know if they use their voice, change will happen for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we'll just continue to obviously monitor. You're right, we decide on All-Stars now a year in advance. We're getting better at that. Therefore, we made this decision a year ago."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll continue to monitor the situation there, but our players won't run away from it. They'll want to help change and effect change, and we'll use our platform and their platform to do just that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so it is great to actually inherit, I'll call it. Quite frankly, again, we didn't do what we did in the bubble in 2020 to have a season, which is existential for us, I'm not sure we're at this moment with these household names coming into our league, because there might have been nowhere to play had we been out of the sports landscape for 20 months. We certainly wouldn't have the momentum we all have in women's basketball and are enjoying."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I'm thrilled that we have household names coming in. We need to market around that. In fact, one of the things we did for the first time ever was we did a media ad buy from the Sweet 16 into the final for the WNBA. You might have seen them. I have a prop with me today. Rookie-O's. Arike was in one of the commercials and Stewie was in another, and we had another one predicting when the rookies come in."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I thought it was clever, and Arike and Stewie did an amazing job. But this was an investment in bringing that NCAA viewer into the WNBA, and we hadn't done it before."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I know just from my circles in life, hearing people who are all talking about the WNBA, that we're going to be successful in that. But it is about marketing, so deployment of that capital in the marketing area. We've increased our marketing budget significantly for this year to capture just that, and I think we're already seeing the returns on that. We had 98 percent positive sentiment on this ad campaign. I mean, that's the W. Ninety-eight percent positive. We're really excited about that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So those are the types of things, but we have a variety of other things. You might have seen some that were at the NBA All-Star Game, how we stood up activations there, and Sabrina-Steph in the three-point competition obviously was a highlight of that weekend. Just continuing to have our player marketing agreement players that we're paying in the offseason to market on behalf of the W. We've got Aliyah Boston here today doing a lot of -- she obviously did an amazing job, I thought, on broadcast during the NCAA Tournament, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're trying a lot of different things now that we have some of that financial capital and human capital, because you need human capital, too, to grow. So we've been able to hire a lot of people in our marketing group, and we had very few when I came in. We have a Chief Marketing Officer now and we have the power of the NBA brand, too, helping us market."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,It's all shaping up to continue to take these household names and build new household names.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, we continue to look at the data that comes through and where there's anomalies or unusual -- again, this year is going to be an unusual year overall because of our footprint with an Olympic break, about a three-week Olympic break. But I think next year we'll have a great footprint. We've continued to look at the data around injuries and the hardship system and things like that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We also continue to look at where the 10, 11, 12 players on our rosters fall as far as playing time and things like that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll continue to take a look at it. I think for now, the roster spots are going to remain at 12. But again, as I said, we're going to add 48 roster spots in probably a three-year period or so, and that's a lot. So we'll give a lot more -- I thought you were going to ask me because my goal is we have -- we need to give these players a lot more opportunities to play at the professional level, and that's what growth is. That's what's going to fund the growth, whether you talk about revenue, media deals, corporate partners, the more cities you're in. Again, longest-tenured league, 330 million people in this country, not enough to be in 12, so now we have 13, on our way to 16, and I think we can do even more after that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think that's the way to add these roster spots for purposes of the game, as we've looked at the data. But we continue to monitor that for sure and talk with our players quite frankly about it, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, I just want to thank you all. Again, for those that are new to this league, watch, rep, buy, attend. It's an amazing game on the court, and I probably wouldn't have taken this job if it wasn't. I really appreciate all your support. Thank you. Enjoy tonight."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"For the first question, the moment, man, it was the moment for me. Right before the Commissioner said my name, I just looked down and thought to myself and said a little prayer, like it's your time, it's God's timing. She said my name, and that's when the water works started happening. Just super grateful for this moment and this opportunity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Your second question with Shakira, great player. Followed her from D-I all the way to the W. I think I'm just happy to really get the opportunity to play alongside her. Such a great player. I think that she's going to elevate me. I can elevate her, too. But whatever impact I can take for this team and to this organization."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Very rewarding, and I think one of the things going into this league that I want to do is just expand my game. Might be asked to play a different role, but I'm open to it. I see myself as a versatile player and impacting in any position that I'm asked to play in."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Yeah, it's going to be a tough league, tough first year, but I'm pumped and I'm ready for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's been a lot. Long days, a lot of long days. But once I hit the weekend, once I was with my fellow draftees, that's when I started really sinking in the moment and just being appreciative for being a part of this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"The W is the W, and it's a great league. I'm just super excited to be a part of it, but the process is no joke, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, just to have a dream like this and to actually walk through it, I said this out there, it's just amazing. A lot of people have dreams, but a lot of people aren't able to achieve it. For me to be fortunate enough to say that and to keep going and to keep pushing my dreams, it's just amazing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"I would say my message for the younger girls is just be confident, be who you are, but know your worth. I mean, coming from Canada, wasn't given as many opportunities as, say, my fellow draftees, but I made the best out of it, and I earned everything that I was given. Stay humble but let them know."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's great. The Bleed Blue bleeds all the way into the league. I'm just very fortunate to be given the opportunity to go to UConn and spend my four years there, but especially spend my four years there with Nika. We had a hug when my name was called. It's just a lot because the people and the relationships you build over this beautiful game that we play, it's amazing, and to share this moment with her and Coach and CD Chris Dailey and J Jamelle Elliott and Mo Morgan Valley, and Paige and Azzi were in the audience, too, it's a family. I'm hoping to make a new family in D.C."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"It feels great. I feel like the platform that I was given, even though at first I wasn't really sure that I was able to step into it, but I've had to step into it. I've had to kind of live in my truth because I know that a lot of young girls are looking up to me and a lot of people who are inspired to be like me are watching. You're not only playing for yourself, you're playing for those following behind you, and you're also playing for those who laid the groundwork in front of you."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Coming into the W, I respect that. I appreciate, I'm not going to say elders because I don't want them getting on me, but I appreciate our vets, and I'm going to soak up all the experience, but also knowing that I have a huge impact across the border in Canada and across the border in Asia, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say what excites me the most is coming into this Liberty team and learning from the vets that are there, and just going in and continuing to grow."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,I would say something that stood out to me is them looking basically for a two-way player and me being just that. So knowing that I can come in and be a two-way player and make an impact that way is something that I look forward to.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I approach being on a team like that, just coming in each and every day, just getting in the gym and putting in that work to be able to do what those expectations are and just coming in and being ready."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say that makes it a little bit easier. Just coming in and having a certain role and knowing what's expected of you and knowing that you don't have to be the superhero or anything like that. So I would say that that would definitely make it a lot better or -- well, yeah, coming in, learning from those vets."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I'm very excited to work with her and just learn from her and take whatever I can take from her and take it to my game. I would say just being able to score in different ways, that's a way that I can come in and help the Liberty."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is definitely my passing. I think that's at times what gets overlooked in my game. I think the scoring and the long shots is what everybody falls in love with. Then obviously going to an organization that has, in my eyes, one of the best post players in the entire world. My point guard eyes just light up at that. And obviously, Aliyah has been one of my teammates before. I'm excited. I can't wait."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, I don't really feel like I have a rival. I think the biggest thing is the WNBA is so competitive right now. Every single time you step on the floor, it's going to be a rivalry. I think so many teams are loaded with so much talent. This is the most competitive league in the entire world. Less than 144 spots."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"So you'd better bring it every single night, and I think that's exactly what I'm going to do. But I think that's exactly how I lived my college career, too, is every single game, no matter what the opponent was I prepped the exact same way, I prepared the same way, I brought the same fire, I brought the same energy. I think that's the biggest thing going into my WNBA career."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is I vividly remember Coach Bluder during my home visit in my recruiting. It was at the end of my junior year, I believe, or maybe the beginning of my junior year. Sometime during my junior year. I think the biggest thing is we talked about this moment, we dreamed of this moment, but she also believed I would be here and she coached me really hard to get to this moment."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"There was a lot of ups and downs. Something I really appreciated about Coach Bluder is no matter what awards or success or wins we ever had or I had, it's like she never stopped coaching me, she never stopped holding me accountable. She always thought there was ways for me to get better. She still thinks that, and I still think that. That's one of the things I just love about her. First of all, she believed I would be here from the day I committed to her, even before that when I was in eighth grade, but also she pushed me really hard to make me as good as I am."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Definitely Aliyah Boston. Come on now. I think also Erica Wheeler. A vet, somebody that has been in the league a long time, somebody that is in the organization, has been in the league, understands what it's about, somebody that I can lean on. I'm 22 years old, and I don't have all the answers in the world. This is something new to me. This is a new challenge. That's something I'm excited for. But having those type of people around me to lean on and ask questions, or when things get hard, to be there for me. I think those two, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think obviously the course of the last few weeks has been pretty insane in my life, the last two months playing basketball as long as I possibly could in my college career, and then went home for a couple days. I got off the plane when we landed in Iowa City, drove directly home, had cook my mom cook me a meal, and then I drove back to Iowa City the next day. We had our celebration, and then I flew to L.A., flew to New York and now I'm here sitting at this stage."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is I'm just very lucky to be in this moment, and all these opportunities and these things, they're once in a lifetime. When things might get tiring or you have to do stuff, I think the biggest thing is look at it just as an opportunity. This isn't something everybody gets to do. It's once in a lifetime, and just trying to soak in every single experience because I know how quick of a turnaround it is, and I have a lot of people helping me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Then obviously Aliyah Boston, there's so much you can say about her. Rookie of the Year. In my eyes, one of the best players in the league. Like I said, as a point guard, my biggest job is I'm just feeding Aliyah the ball every single day. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be in there and be like, go make a layup. She's going to make my life easy."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"She's incredible. But the thing I love about her is she's a great person. She loves the game, she knows the game, she supports the game and she has a smile that affects a lot of people and brings a lot of joy to people when they watch her. I can't wait to be her teammate again."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, if I'm being completely honest, I feel like it doesn't change a ton from how I lived my life over the course of the last year. Sponsorships stay the same. The people around me, agents and whatnot, have been able to help me and guide me through the course of the last year. I don't know if I would be in this moment if it wasn't for a lot of them. My mom has done a lot, my dad has done a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think that's just the biggest thing. The advice I would say is just lean on the people around you. I don't have to do every single thing. I think at the same time, in college I always said my main focus is on basketball. That's why I've had every other opportunity in my life is because of the way I carry myself, the way I play the game. Going into my professional career, I plan to do the exact same thing. My focus is solely on basketball, being the best I can."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I don't have to do school anymore. That's pretty exciting. I do have to get my degree. I graduate on May 14th. Other than that, my 110 percent focus is on basketball, and when I do that really well and carry myself really well, everything just kind of takes care of itself."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely. I'm actually an executive producer on the show, which has been kind of fun for myself. When Peyton Manning reached out, obviously it's his production company, I was a little skeptical at first, but I was like, I don't know if I really want to let people into my life like that. I've never really done it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"But the way this year has unfolded, the way obviously Kamilla and Kiki, the seasons that they had, you can't script it any better. It's been absolutely incredible for women's basketball. If you're a women's basketball fan or you're not a women's basketball fan, I encourage you to watch the show when it comes out. I've seen bits and pieces. It's absolutely amazing. It really allows you to understand the student-athlete for way more than just a basketball player, and I think that's really important. I think that's going to allow fans of the W, fans of college to really understand what they go through, but love them even more for who they are and what they do and what they're about."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I'm excited for everybody to see it, and it's been a special project."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely, and that's definitely our goal is to get back to championship habits. I think it's so cool for me. I vividly remember my freshman year during the bubble, we played Kentucky in the round of 32 and Tamika was calling the game and I was like tweaking out. I couldn't believe she was calling one of my games. Somebody I idolized, somebody that I loved and somebody that is not only a great basketball player and everything that she did but she's a tremendous person."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think that speaks to the organization as a whole, and everything that they do is so first class. I'm very lucky to be going there to an organization that really loves women's basketball. You see it today, I think they had 17,000 tickets claimed to just watch the draft. I think that shows the excitement in Indianapolis. It's a great basketball city. Obviously, what the Pacers have been able to do this year is special, in the Playoffs. I think I'm just excited."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Like you said, there's a lot of young talent on the team, and just getting back to the Playoffs and doing everything we can to win a lot of basketball games is certainly the goal."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, honestly, I feel like this was definitely a little bit more emotional for me. I think that's because when you're in the heat of competition, you don't have time to really feel your emotions. You're so competitive and you're so fiery, you're not really worried about all that. I think that was the biggest thing through my career is, first of all, I was able to have a lot of closure in the way my career ended and everything I was able to do. Obviously, I played the maximum number of games I could play my senior year. Obviously, we didn't win, but you feel like you did everything you can to be in that moment and compete as hard as you can."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"But when you're kind of just sitting at a table waiting for your name to be called, I think that really allows the emotions to feed you and you're with your family. Obviously, playing a basketball game, I'm not out there with my family. So sharing that moment with them and enjoying it, and people that have really had my back and believed in me more than anyone, is super special."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Well, I know the Indiana Hoosiers didn't love me too much during my career, but hopefully we can turn a lot of them into Fever fans, if they're not already."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think going to a state that supports not only basketball but women's basketball, going and playing in front of -- at Indiana, the place is sold out. Doing the same for the Fever is certainly our goal, and having a lot of fans there every single night."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"For myself, I can't imagine a more perfect fit, a better place for me to start my professional career, an organization that really just believes in women's basketball and wants to do everything the right way. So I couldn't be more excited to get there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It means the most to me. Just tells me that I'm going to be in good hands, and I'm just excited to get there and get to work with her."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,It's been an amazing day. It was my first time over there. Just a nice view.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Getting my hair done and my makeup done was also amazing. Getting here, getting drafted was amazing. It's just been a really special moment for me, and everything is going just like I dreamt of."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I would say just getting in the league and bringing my winning leadership, my winning mentality. We won two national championships, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Just getting better, being more physical, more competition. I'm just excited to get out there and play with some of the big names of women's basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that was the dream, but honestly, no, I didn't really expect this. I'm just so proud that I am here right now. I know little Kamilla, when I was 13 years old, is also proud. I'm just excited to be here and happy."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,It's been a crazy couple of days. I'm just so proud of my teammates for winning the national championship. I'm just so happy to be here.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I got really emotional because the main goal was to get here and being able to give my family a better life, and just by looking at them and seeing them at my table was amazing. I obviously get emotional when I talk about my family because I'm so proud of everything I was able to accomplish and do for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,I think it's going to be great. She's a great player. I'm a great player. So two great players together. Nobody is going to get no rebounds on us.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,This is actually going to be my first time in Chicago. I'm really excited. I've heard really good things about it. You have some of the best pizzas. I'm excited to get there.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I would like to go play overseas somewhere. I think that gets you better. Every time I played for my national team, it got me better somehow. So I'm excited to go to the WNBA and be able to play overseas somewhere."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that tells you a lot about Coach Staley. She gets you ready for this level. She gets you prepared for whenever you step to the next level, and like I said, that just tells you everything about her. She gets you super prepared for the league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I don't know, I'm just excited to get there, get to work, learn from the best and just step up my game. Step my game up."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"My main goal as a WNBA player is just to step my game, being a sponge, soaking in everything from everybody, learn each and every day, and be a better version of myself each and every day. Be open to learning new stuff and stay ready."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,My conversations with them have been amazing. I'm all about energy. She has a great energy. He has a great energy. I'm just excited to get there and get to work with them.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"And about specific to me, I'm just excited to meet the whole team."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,I'm happy. I'm really excited. She's a great player. I'm a great player. I think we're going to do great things together.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I love that I get to stay on the West Coast, and I love that they took a chance on me, and I feel like I'm just going to show that I can work really hard and help them a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But also, I'll be close to family, which is really important for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"That's a good question. I would say I just want to continue the legacy of growing the sport, and I feel like I've said this a lot today, but we really have to look back at the women before us, and I know people keep saying this is a historic draft class but there were many, many talented draft classes before us."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I just want to give my props to the Dawn Staleys, Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslies because they are why I'm here, because I watched them growing up. I just hope that I can continue that legacy for younger girls."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"So growing up, I said this earlier before, as well, but growing up, I was kind of first introduced to the league because my mom was a product line manager at Nike and worked on Dawn Staley's signature shoe and worked with Tamika Catchings and Jen Rizzotti, who I've played 3-on-3 basketball for."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Growing up I had so much admiration for these women. It was really upsetting to not see that reciprocated by the public, what you see on social media, and I always do think the negative stands out more than the positive unfortunately, but it was really upsetting for me, and there were a lot of times where I was just kind of dumbfounded by the negativity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I think now there's a positive switch, and hopefully we can just keep that momentum going."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Yeah, so I studied communications at Stanford, and my parents both worked for Nike for 20-plus years, grew up in Beaverton. That's where the world headquarters are, so I'm definitely a Nike kid born and raised."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But New Balance came to me with -- I see you're wearing New Balances, by the way. I love it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Yes, to answer your first question, I think in these situations it's a business now, and you never know. I had great conversations with the Sparks and Raegan Pebley and Curt, and they're amazing, but you just never know, and I didn't want to assume anything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"It's just such a high-stress environment, as well, so when they called my name, just a huge wave of emotions hit me. When I saw my mom tearing up and my dad, that definitely hit home. Just was super thankful."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Actually, I actually FaceTimed Steph like five minutes before the show started. He just said to just have fun with it. I think he can just share so much great advice because obviously he's been through this, and he just said to make stuff like this fun because it can be stressful. So to make it fun. He answered my mom's FaceTime call. I called Seth Curry, as well. He hung up immediately because that's Seth. But then he called back right after."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Yeah, they're both just great sounding boards for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I specifically remember playing against Australia I think U-16 or U-17 it was, and honestly they're some of the strongest people I've ever played against. When they hit you with a screen, it takes you a while to recover. And Lauren Jackson is one of my favorite players ever. I just really admire her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Do you want to ask Cheryl or me? They turned up the pressure. It's the end of the game. Of course we are both trying to win. They turned up the pressure and we got a couple turnovers. We didn't execute our offensive plays at the end, so that's what their defense was doing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I saw a very physical and aggressive New York team. We know this from being a part of the game for so long that sometimes you get away with this stuff when you're physical and aggressive, and they certainly did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,It's a shame that officiating had such a hand in a series like this. Obviously there's always going to be a team that's going to be a little more disappointed than the other.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I thought today was incredibly disappointing. The challenge -- we have got to change our challenge rules. The officials doing the game should have a third party, because that was not a foul. That call should have been reversed on that challenge. If we sent that clip in -- well, first of all, Napheesa Collier, the number of times she was held, et cetera, there was nothing down on that end. For whatever reason in this series, that's kind of the way it was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"At the other end, when we challenged it, if we would have turned that clip in, they would have told us that it was marginal contact, no foul. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. So when you review, those should be the same parameters that you're reviewing with. But the three people on the game need a third party to let them know. Because that decided the game. That decided the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"You watched the whole series, right? What makes her difficult is you're spending a lot of time guarding Sabrina and Stewie. In some of those schemes, it created mismatches. But we were going to live with some of that. We knew that JJ was going to score. These guys shot 30 percent. Shot 30 percent. The difference was in the foul line."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Obviously we needed to execute better on offense I think one of these guys said that. We had opportunities not to fuel them. But we knew they were coming. We just needed -- our lead guard spot was obviously rough for us tonight. We get a little bit decent play out of there, we win the game. But with all that happened, we still almost put ourselves in position to do this. I hurt for our players. I really, really hurt. They are an incredibly special group."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think that was kind of the end-of-quarter situation. We were up 12. It was 32-20. We allowed them to come back to get it to within seven or something like that going into the half. That's where we have to be better. That's been throughout the series, too, that end of quarters and things like that. It's hard when you're playing a team at home, a team that knows each other well and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"It's hard to just pick one thing, you know what I'm saying, when you still have a chance to win the game. I think, yeah, we could have executed better, but there were so many things that went on throughout the game that we still gave ourselves a chance to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"It's been the same. Game 5, everybody is making their adjustments, mid-game, mid-possession. We are flying around. Everybody knows each other so well at this point. Everybody is trying to make a play and stop them from making a play. They made some plays in the second half."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,We talked about handling their pressure.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Handling the pressure, executing our offense, not turning the ball over to let them get energy in transition and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, probably because I was getting held a little bit. It was a little hard to make shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"No, I think, you know, of course, like they said, everyone is trying to make adjustments in the second half. I got a lot of shots up in the first. I was making a lot, so they tightened up their defense, brought people in rotation, were doubling, things like that. They were upping the pressure and it got harder."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I shared with them exactly what you said. Incredibly proud that since the day we got together in training camp all the way through to the end, we were the same team. We never got the disease of ""me."" Not one single player on the team got the disease of ""me,"" not one. Those that were maybe in the rotation, fell out of the rotation, some that never got to play, no one ever put themselves first, no one. That is incredibly difficult to find in this day and age."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm really, really proud, incredibly proud of the number of people that were impacted by Lynx basketball and how excited they are to watch their team play. I told them, it's who they are as people and how they did it. So those are things we talked about. I wouldn't trade them for anyone. Anyone. Any team. Do things the right way. Built the team within the rules. Those sort of things that maybe right now aren't happening in our league. And did it the hard way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"You know what, we gave hope to those teams that aren't willing to circumvent the cap or fly illegally or all the stuff that's happened over the last five years. Do it the right way gives hope for those other teams that you can build a team just like ours. You don't have to have a super team. You don't have to have that. There's a different way to do it. So I'm incredibly proud of them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, it's really rare. Saying that this is my 11th season, and I get to go out to fight with women that I consider sisters, that's why it feels the way it does. Every single day we came to work, we enjoyed being with each other, competing with each other, fighting for each other, and that's why we're here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"That's why we gave ourselves a chance to compete for a championship, because we showed up every day and did it the right way and did it for each other. That's really rare in this league. The way that it's happening and all this other bulls--- that people make seem like it's important, it's not."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Obviously the exclamation point to the incredible season that she had. You know, Napheesa showed up big time for this team. Put us in a position to be within seconds of a championship. Phee was phenomenal."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I'm always so in awe of Phee because she carries it with such grace. She carries it her own way. As a superstar in this league, it can become about something else. But she always keeps it about the team and always keeps it about winning and continuing to get better and better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I'm always in awe of her. Every time she steps on the court and the way she carries herself and no matter what's going on, she's so consistent. That comes from her. That's her internal -- amazing. We just have so much confidence in who she is on and off the court. I'm lucky to be alongside of her. I'm just in awe. She's had an amazing season and amazing postseason obviously. Can't wait to see what she does in the future."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"That's what's coming. I think greater recognition, that's what's coming. Phee has earned every bit of it. Like you said, still, the season she's had, it's not Phee that you're hearing about. It's other players. But I think Phee has earned it. We'll see going into next season if maybe she'll be a little bit more a face of the league."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Well, that's really loaded. It's a lot for me to think about right now, forgive me. I really don't have an answer for that. That's just pretty deep for me. And plus, there's proprietary secrets."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"No, she was tremendous in the playoffs. Really gave them a lift every single time she got minutes. Not surprised. They went big."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"It's crazy how the series ended. For four games, it was about the three ball, three ball, three ball. Certainly offensive rebounds throughout the whole thing. But then tonight came down to points in the paint. We don't even score in the paint and we had 44, was it, right. So it was really interesting how the series ended with them playing bigger. They won the game with their defense, no doubt about it, with their defense. Anyway, to your question, her minutes were really good, really helped them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I know all the headlines will be ""Reeve Cries Foul."" Bring it on. Bring it on. Because this s--- was stolen from us. Bring it on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"We talked about it. We know we could have done some things, but you shouldn't have to overcome to that extent. This s--- ain't that hard. Officiating, it's not that hard. When someone is being held, be consistent. If you don't want to call it a hold at one end, don't call it at the other. Be consistent. Every team asks for that. Sandy asked for that last game. Three of the games in this series, we're talking about the same damn thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"So I tell these guys, for whatever reason, it didn't work out. It just doesn't feel right that you lose a series with that level of discrepancy. We don't have a team that whines and complains and all that stuff. Sometimes it probably hurts us. Maybe being a little more, I don't know, something. But you have a star player like Phee, that just, I don't get it. I don't get how she can be held and go to the basket and get hit, and then a marginal, at best, at best, sends their best player to the free throw line. I mean, that's tough. It's tough to swallow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Just like our 2016 championship that was lost -- officiating, missing a shot clock violation. This sucks. This is for a championship for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams. This isn't that hard."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"So it's disappointing. I mean, congratulations to the Liberty on their first championship. Been around, I don't know, how long has the league been around? 28 years? It took them 28 years. Congrats to them. We were that close to our fifth. Just didn't happen."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"It's disappointing. It's incredibly disappointing. But these guys, I mean, they've got to try to pick themselves up and go, ""We were that damn close."" It hurts. It hurts."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I've been like manifesting this moment for a while. And there's no feeling like it. You know, this game, and credit to Minnesota, because they gave us a tough series. The fans have been amazing everywhere we've gone. But to be able to bring a championship to New York, first ever in franchise history, it's an incredible feeling. I literally can't wait to continue to celebrate with the city because I know it's going to like, be bonkers. Bonkers. Fact, right."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I came in with a game plan of like, it doesn't matter. I want to play defense. I want to rebound. I want to do the little things, and I'll continue to be aggressive and shoot my shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But if they are not falling, they are not falling. I'm not going to let that affect the way I do things. So continuing to be there for my team. I didn't talk about this, but before I made the free throws, I missed two free throws. I was like, no, I can't do this again, I can't. I have to be here. Olaf Lange, him and I have talked about being a python, where it's like you know your moment when to strike. At that moment, I was just thinking about being a python."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,Good job. You were. Like it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Be a python.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"JJ can come sit up here, JJ. Let's go, MVP."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I thought they were pretty fair laughter. I mean, the last game, that's where you get give and take. Game No. 1, we should have won that game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I have so much respect for Cheryl, and I have so much respect for that Minnesota Lynx team, because man, that was ugly. But we found a way to win. I'm really proud of our team, how resilient we were, how we stuck together and how we continue to trust each other. That was our word today, just trust the process. We found a way to win. Then going back to Stewie, she did miss two free throws, which is rare for her. But in that five seconds to go, she said, ""I'm going to make 'em."" I'm like, good. I was praying laughter, but it worked."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'll start here. It's been 10 years, so a decade. I was due one. The last three or four, been runners-up, bridesmaid."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It feels good. Now, it's a little bit different, because back then we were so dominant in Phoenix. We got through Minnesota Lynx in the semifinals and then it was 3-0 against Chicago and only the last game was tight when BG was out."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"This has been a grind every single game. There's things we could have done better, too. But we never strayed away from who we are as a team. I never strayed away from who I am as a coach."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think I just love these ladies here. They are amazing humans. They are fun to coach. But it's the same feeling. That was a great team, a very connected team, and so is this team. That's what I've said in the media a lot, haven't I. I said this feels like the 2014 team that I have coached. I'm just so happy, for everyone, this organization, but particularly these players, that we win today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"I don't know if they are bragging rights. It's for my whole family, basically, specifically Satou. She's been with me every step of the way and has been in my corner through my ups and downs, and I've had a lot of downs in my career. This ring is for her as much as it is for me."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"For me, I'm happy. Just really happy and trying to take in the moment and enjoy every aspect of it. I'm just up here smiling and thanking Jesus and thanking my teammates. Yeah, just enjoying the moment."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No, I prepared her at halftime. I just felt, going with a bigger lineup, I said, okay, be ready, we may go for a big lineup. So Nyara, you're coming in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just thought what she brings, she has that X-factor. Her ability to make one-on-one plays, to rebound the ball, to play great defense. I mean, all of it. And then to finish plays. Finish plays."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So I prepared her. Really, really proud of her. I know she's had a lot of adversity over here career, but the biggest game of her career, and she really rose to the occasion. For a young player, that says a lot about her. I mean, the future is pretty bright."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Can I say something? Thank you.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what's incredible about Ny is if you look back at the semifinal series, she didn't really play. Then she stayed ready and knew that in the Finals, her time will come and she continued to stick with it. When we needed her most, because you were the X-factor tonight, Ny."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, we were tired. We were trying to do whatever we could. We needed, like a spark and she was that. She continued to trust the process and we are so proud of Ny. So proud."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"When I hugged Stewie, I was sobbing in her ear. I didn't say one word. I was just crying the whole time. I'm so happy to win and do it with her. We talked about it so much, about coming together and what we envisioned of what we wanted to do in New York, and what we could do, to be able to pull it off and accomplish a dream. It's so freaking hard to do. It just means a lot. It means a lot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I told her this before, but I've watched Stewie be great for so long, in high school and then in college and then in the WNBA. For a long time, she was that person that I was kind of like chasing in college I want my game to be at her level and play against her in the WNBA and to ultimately be teammates."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"It really just means a lot to be able to win with her and to watch the way that she approaches the game every day. The way that she leads our team, because she is our leader and we look to her in tough moments. So it just really means a lot to have everything come together and to be able to win together."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But then I think it was picture perfect to be able to embrace JJ. Really what I was saying was like, she led us. Her dominance in the paint, on the boards, help-side defense. Everything that we needed, she was there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"She had to wait awhile to get to this point, to get to the Finals to win a championship. But the wait was worth it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,Definitely was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"The wait was so, so, so worth it. We talked about it two years ago when it was free agency, and we wanted to come together. You look back and me, JJ, Sloot, we all came together to win a championship. Last year we lost in the Finals. But look at us, now we're here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,THE MODERATOR,"There's no practice tomorrow, so...."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,No practice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was like, let's go. You know, I've won one championship. I've been in many Finals and competed for so long. It's hard to win because this league is so good. You need a little bit of luck on your side, but you also need talent. You also need talent, the right talent to put together."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,I think Jonathan Kolb did a really great job of getting these players to come to New York and sell the vision that we had here. We wanted to win. New York has never won before.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,Now we are going to go in the history books as the first ever. That makes me very proud. Because it's hard. People think it's easy.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I was excited just to coach great talent. I didn't really know them that well. I knew Stewie probably a little bit more than JJ because I coached her wife, Marta, in Phoenix. Hopefully that helped a little bit to get her here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's a journey. So it's getting to know each other. I think it's been fun. Hey, let's not stop at one, though. Let's go for two."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I'm not really sure exactly when we flipped the switch. I just remember just like weathering the storm and us really talking about making sure we kept our emotions in check and that we just kept executing and that it was going to be a grind. I think obviously we came out with the win, but I don't really remember an exact moment where the switch was flipped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,How big was Leo's three in the corner? I'm going to tell you this as a fact Whoever scores first in overtime usually wins. I was confident after that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Am I really the only New Yorker on this team? That is incredible.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Honestly, winning in Seattle was amazing and nothing takes away from that. But to be able to bring the first ever to the Liberty and the first in 51 years -- like you guys know, my first WNBA game I ever went to was at MSG, was the Liberty. And to have that be full circle was amazing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Today throughout my whole day, everybody was texting me, like, ""How are you? Are you ready?"" All these things. ""Do your thing."""
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"And I was calm. I was ready because I knew that no matter what, the city was going to have our back. They showed up and they showed out, and they continued to be there for us when we needed. I'm so proud of this team but so happy to be able to bring the first championship here because the city deserves it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen this next week, but I'm sure s--- is going to be crazy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Parade in the Bahamas.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,Definitely. I think we need to have a parade in the Bahamas. Let's go!
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Really, really proud of JJ. I love coaching her. I just love her personality, how she brings it every single day. She was big for us. It wasn't a pretty game today. But we were trying to establish her early. At both ends, she worked her butt off. Usually I don't like to play her 42 minutes, but she just stayed competing because that's how important it was. She knew how she needed to help us. She's been big for us. She's been big for us all season long but particularly these playoffs. She's amazing. We love you, JJ. So proud of you, mate. You deserve this. Your first one, baby."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,We want to have an exhibition game in the Bahamas next year.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Parade.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Parade, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"Parade, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"For me, just trying to get the infrastructure of the Bahamas to be a little bit better for sports and especially girls sports in the Bahamas to be a little bit better. I think you need more investment in sports in the Bahamas, to give the kids more games and to allow them to be able to have more developmental camps and different things going on. Just to have more people invested in it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I want to make it my mission to help just grow the game in the Bahamas because we have so much natural talent. So many people that come out of the Bahamas go to the U.S. and go to school, end and up be being really successful. I would like the kids to be able to stay home in the Bahamas and stay with their families and then still be able to come to the U.S. to play professionally. That's the next step we have to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I'm really proud of my journey. I was talking to Rebecca Lobo earlier after shootaround and just basically telling her, I was doing this thing where we are about to run out after our theme or whatever and they would have the theme music playing. I would look up and be just taking everything in and just really being appreciative of the moment and just having a moment of gratitude without -- with all the chaos that was going on in the Finals, just a moment to just exhale, to breathe and just look around at all the things that we've been able to do, and all the people that are in the gym watching women's sports and the city, like Stewie said, really supporting us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"That really helped keep things in perspective. I went out there to play to win and not to lose. The experience that I had, even though it wasn't the best experience and we lost in the past, it allowed me to be a little bit more relaxed in the situation and just understand that these moments aren't guarantees. It's not a given. You have to kind of just take advantage of it but also live in the moment and really appreciate what it took to get here, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"That's a big lineup right there. But I mean, it means a lot, obviously. She did say something at halftime. But I feel like throughout the whole season, it's been unwavering support, whether from Sandy or my teammates and in general, everybody in this organization has always kind of believed in me, which means so much. They drafted me knowing I had to sit out a year. That just shows how much trust they have in me."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"I feel like this whole season, every time I'm on the floor, my teammates have my back and tell me just to keep going, work hard. It means the world to be able to have players like Stewie and JJ, who I've looked up to my whole career, be my teammates, and now win a championship with them. That's something that I will remember forever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"It's really hard to compare the Olympics to this moment. Especially with Team USA, because at the Olympics, we were going for eight straight gold medals. The pressure is insane, but also the pressure bringing a championship to a city that has never had one, especially in the WNBA, has been a lot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't know, this is something that I think I'll be remembering forever, and each Olympics I also remember forever. But the time together is so short. Like, it's three weeks."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But like, this is my team. This is my squad. We continue to go to battles together. With the Olympics, you come together for a few days. You have practice and then you go and you play exhibition games against Germany in London, and it's hard to build that chemistry and stuff. But you just know you're Team USA and here now, we're New York Liberty."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't think I answered your question, but each one is really special, and they are not comparable."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, this one? This is more personal. This is more personal because I'm from New York. I'm from upstate. I came here for a reason, and that's to win a championship."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Thank you for that shaking Breanna's hand.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Yeah, I mean, it's really just the -- thinking in German, sorry."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,You speak German? Go for it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Really it's just the mental preparation of staying ready and being locked in, knowing that whenever you have -- like whatever minutes you get, that's what you get and you need to be ready to go on the floor. Because our team has such a high standard, and really, to be able to live up to that, you have to be mentally ready. Otherwise, you'll just kind of hurt the team in the long run."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"But with great teammates like that, it's kind of easy to just get on the floor and leave it all out there. Because my role is pretty simple Run the floor, get rebounds and maybe shoot some buckets. But they make it really easy. They make it really easy for me. It's just like I always said, there's so much talent on the floor, and just being able to bring something to that is just something everybody dreams of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Pepper, we got you. We got you. But it's not tomorrow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just went in and told them what I saw and what we needed to do, the adjustments. Obviously I didn't think we were playing with the right amount of urgency. Things were a little too easy for them, and so I just encouraged them. Hey, let's go, 20 more minutes. Then I talked about the big lineup. Be ready for the big lineup. I just thought, I was thinking that all day today, and if things are going hard, we're fatigued. It's been a grueling schedule, five games, and that's a tough team, just the way that they make us work really hard."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,So I kind of prepared Nyara in that regard and I'm very thankful that it worked well for us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I'll talk for the players.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Yes, please."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what we said was Minnesota, they had 34 points at halftime. Our offense wasn't coming easy, but eventually it was going to come through. Continue to shoot your shots with confidence. But if it's going to be an ugly game, we will win ugly. We've talked about first five minutes, first five minutes, whatever. No. Third quarter. Third quarter is going to be our quarter, especially with the city behind us and the fans behind us. We came out and continued to execute. I think throughout the entire game, we talked about coming together. Huddling, talking about schemes, making sure everybody is calm and confident. And we did that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yes, we did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Seven games next year.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Seven, nice. Hopefully we have more time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Basically we knew we had more in the tank to give and 20 more minutes for the end of the season.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I felt like, because I was just thinking about today, and it's like whether we win or lose, we want to put it all on the line. Because last year when we lost, there was more in the tank. And this year, that wasn't happening."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure. All season long, Lan has been in those positions for us. Just appreciate her ability to turn around and buck up and do what her team needed her to do. She's important. Important for her to be on the floor for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I thought it was obvious what we were trying to do. We went four flat and said, Court, make a play. The last thing we said was, we've got to get the last shot. Didn't want to shoot too early. Make sure we get the last shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"We said, BC Bridget Carleton, if you have a chance, follow it up and see if you can tip one in and get fouled laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I think the players, the players deserve all the credit for the show that we are being treated to. I thought both teams played well. It was a good game. Obviously both teams, things you can point to -- you wish you made a layup or you wish you didn't do this or that. That's the way a game always is."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"But no, I'm looking forward to seeing what the ratings are for this one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"The same defense as always. Try to make it as hard as possible for them to get the shots they want. They are good players. They are going to get shots off. But they can't get easy ones. So that's my goal, to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it's an epitome of the year she's had and how important she's been to the team. Shot making, big three. She's a hustle-play player, so that was on display. Go give yourself a chance to maybe either put it in or get fouled."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,That's just what she does every day we are around her. She's the same. You can always count on her to be there for you. We're obviously super proud of Bridget.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Same. I completely agree. I feel like Bridget is just so reliable every time. Like Coach said, we can bank on her to make those hustle plays and to be cool and collected at the end to make those free throws. That's the hardest shot, honestly, in basketball, is to make free throws at the end of the game. To make those at the down at the big moment is who BC is."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,They were saying Naz Reid free tattoos. I think BC free tattoos is next.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I think you hit the nail on the head. It's unfortunate those teams were a joy to watch. But it's a sign of the times where we are now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't know about these guys, but I know when I'm out and I'm in different places and I'm going to one, everyone is talking about it. Everyone is talking to me about it, talking about, I go to this bar, and this is a bar that maybe wouldn't have a women's game on five years ago. All the TVs have the game on and the volume on, and the place is going crazy. I heard that so many times in different establishments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,And obviously I appreciate the opportunity that A Bar of Their Own has given women in making that front and center. I'm happy to support a woman-owned business like that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that what this team has done, obviously the Wolves energized the city in their playoff run, and I'm thrilled to see the same energy came for this team because they deserve it. Obviously the crowd was there tonight, but even more than that, everywhere you go around the city, people are talking about the Lynx."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"It's really tough. I think we are both great players. It was Game 4 and we played each other, what, four times in the regular season. It's going to get harder and harder each time to get the shots that you normally get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Everyone is out there to do the same thing make shots hard. That's my goal every time. She's a great player, one of the best players in the world. But you have to make it as hard as you can for her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to answer the second part, the Game 5. I don't really think about the other ones. I do feel very blessed in my career to have a chance to have been a part of so many. Haven't won them all. You know, when I was in Detroit, we suffered a heartbreak at home. So it runs the gamut. I think that what I'm just thrilled about is that this group gets to experience the Game 5."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It's beyond words how we feel about this team, and we just so wanted them to be in the Finals, No. 1 and two, put themselves in a position to win a championship, and we've done just that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't get a response from the league. I have a text to prove it. I think that -- I think Phee has some things to prove that the fouls weren't called.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"That's unfortunate. You know, I guess I don't really have much more than that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Wish I knew. I'd either not eat or not sleep or I'd sleep really good if I knew the difference. It's two great teams. Who knows? Who knows.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I wanted to come out and enjoy the moment and be as aggressive as possible. When you're playing for your season, after the last game you sit with everything, and you erase it and you want to leave all those internal feelings and put it out there and embrace the crowd."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I just wanted to be out there with my teammates and give it everything we had. Shots go in, they don't go in, whatever. There are always things you can fix. But I was just excited to be out there and compete again after the last game. Shots were falling. That's always a good thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,We were celebrating together and she was saying how proud she is of us and the team. I was telling her that she has to get her butt to New York.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Anybody that has been following along knows this team, from the beginning of the season all the way through to Game 4, has this unique ability to believe in themselves and believe in each other. What we said before the game, can we do it in the toughest of times, right. Because this will be the most that we are tested. We talked about it in shootaround. This will be the most this group has been tested in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I was sure how we would connect and compete. Not sure whether you're going to win the game or not. But I was sure that we were going to be the Minnesota Lynx and how we have done things all season long. You know, the ups and downs and all of that, this group is just equipped to handle it. It's special."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It was expected. Going into the game, we talked about it in the pregame that we were going into the game as if that didn't happen. Whatever was going to show itself was going to show itself and we were going to react. But we didn't have any minute restrictions and anything else we were doing to modify. Just competed."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"We did try to get some players off the floor a little bit more. This one Collier -- we thought about it. But I think overall I was concerned about leaving Lan too long on the bench, sitting too long. But other than that, we weren't concerned."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, Ceci is tough. You know, goes through a stretch of games where maybe she's not contributing like she wants to contribute, and then all of a sudden we had a Ceci sighting at shootaround the other day and these last two games really helping us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy for her. We've always stayed in touch through the years. We've always tried to get her back here. Timing was good for this one, and she's been a great fit for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Sounds like he's rooting for them. He didn't text that to me.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I love it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,Huskies drama.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Looks like I'm going to have to text him about some things now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Bench was really important. We knew they were going to be. They were ready. They were ready. There was a lot of conversations, the teammates, getting them going and getting them ready to be able to make contributions when they got in the game. Give Dorka credit as she remained patient, and when she got the opportunity, I thought her minutes were good. We'll look at the video. But it was nice to be able to have players able to sub in and stay out there for extended time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Is that why we missed layups so we can get down to the nitty-gritty? Is that what she's saying? Laughter.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. Laughter. My heart is still racing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think we gain energy and confidence from one another. I feel like internally we are strong, strong-minded mentally and physically. We have a lot of belief within our group. We problem solve with each other. It's just a belief, like, internally. I don't know how else to explain it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"I think we're excited. I don't even know if I'm thinking about that. I'm thinking that it's a Game 5 of the Finals, that we need to go out and execute. That's really all I'm thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, last 40 minutes of the season. It could be anywhere, really. It doesn't matter. We are going to be out there together going to war, and I'm pumped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Elite players play no matter the environment, home, road. Elite players play and they love the environment and they are not affected by the environment. That's why you see the series has been what it has, winning on each other's court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to say probably information gathered in the three games. Everything is getting harder. So the edge that maybe other games that provided each team, there's no secrets at this point."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I actually was trying to call a timeout, but they didn't hear me. So that's on me. But yeah, you know, it wasn't our best possession. It was loud in here. I don't know, maybe I just have to sprint out in the middle of the court next time. So I've got to be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think that I was going a little bit too fast. I just needed to slow down. They are sending multiple people when I'm slipping on a screen, stuff like that. A little bit better awareness on my part. But quick turnaround and be ready for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"With the two seconds? Yeah, it was like a little screen to get JJ to the block. If not, Sabrina had to come out. So with two seconds, we tried to establish the big girl down low. They defended it well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, obviously they are great players. I think Stewie said it, we took some shots, we probably could have moved it a little bit more."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, I will say this, and I look at the thing here and I know Cheryl talked about it last time, but we got no calls today. So do I need to talk up in a press conference? Because they were getting ticky-tacks. And we went down there and got hit and get nothing. It was like 12-6 at halftime and they tried to even it up near the end. It was 14-9."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No. All we want is fair, okay. So if we are getting hit, that's a foul. You know, I'm one of the nicest bloody coaches in this league, but this pisses me off. Just be fair. You know, if they are getting hit, it's a bloody foul."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that expletive timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,JONQUEL JONES,It's a close-out game. Their backs are against the wall and we are trying to win. It was going to be that type of game tonight where we are both trying to claw and both teams are trying to figure out whatever to do to get over the hump.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, that's what we said we worked for all season long. Minnesota did what they needed to do here to tie it up, and now we go back home. We love playing in front of our home crowd."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So it will definitely be another sellout, and it will definitely be loud. And we have to bring our ""A"" game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I have a lot of respect for Minnesota, don't get me wrong. This is a really tough team, really tough team. They play well. They compete. So we've got one more game, and we're going to win on our home court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"Short-term memory. Just the fact that all that happened tonight is the series is even, and there's a Game 5, winner-take-all. We are going back to New York, and we're going to get it done. You know, getting it done there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, of course. We wanted to get it done tonight. But like Sandy said, our fans are like no other, and to be able to go into our environment on Sunday, know they have our backs. So whenever there are tough situations, whenever we're fighting through all of this adversity, we know we have the crowd behind us. That's just going to continue to motivate us. Yeah, can't wait for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that, you know, for our team, we bounce back after a loss really, really well, and making sure that everybody is on the same page going forward."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"In the playoffs, in a series, there's going to be momentum shifts. There were momentum shifts in the game tonight. But mentally, understanding what's our ultimate goal, how are things going right here. Like Sandy said in the locker room, we haven't won anything yet we haven't lost anything yet. And we have the opportunity to do that Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, I thought as you said, we had the appropriate effort and focus on what we were doing. As the game wore on, the offense got harder and harder for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that one of the things, and you know, like I was saying after Game 1, you feel like the ball isn't moving enough, and I think we got easy stuff when we were able to do that. We were taking hard shots. We had good shots. Didn't make shots, right, and that's what it comes down to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Stewie was making shots. JJ's big three when we were up four, that was a big three. Then obviously Ionescu's shot at the end. It's a battle. We talked about that, players making plays. Unfortunately, we didn't make enough of them to put the ball in the hole."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I mean, I'll let these guys talk about that. Go ahead, you guys. Jump in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I feel like they were making plays at the end of shot clocks and like Coach said, we were getting really good looks. We just weren't executing on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's just hard when you get that and then obviously they are a great offensive team and like Coach said in the locker room, it just puts a lot of pressure on our defense. I think we just need to make more shots, honestly."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't have an update, game finished what, 15 minutes ago? I haven't talked to the trainer."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,KAYLA McBRIDE,Great player made a good shot. I guarded her for 40 minutes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, obviously give credit to Lan. She did what should he could do. We were plus 20 when she was on the floor. So it obviously hurt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our starting five is a really good starting five, and you know, not having Lan, foul trouble, and then just not feeling like she could go put us in a bit of a bind."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, tried different things. You know, just a little bit of a small lineup. See if we could spread the floor and get some easier shots but that didn't produce itself either. We need our starters, just like they need their starters."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't necessarily know that it was -- obviously got fouled. She was, you know, asserting herself in that way. The game is called differently for Phee than it is for Stewie for sure. You look at the same level of activity, and around-the-rim contact. For whatever reason, we have a hard time getting to the foul line in this series."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I think they were getting some switches that they were picking on. You know, as Lan was switching on her. She made some great plays. She attacked, she made threes, she got it going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our defense gave us a chance to win the game. Our defense gave us a chance to win the game, period, and our offense is going to help our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"If you told me that we would have got the amount of stops that we did and we were playing off that, and we wouldn't have scored 80, that would be surprising to me. This team scored 80, its 77-all with the remaining seconds left."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I'll have to look at the film. I know when I was watching it live, I liked some of the shots that we were getting. I've seen our players make those shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, it's not to sit here and say, you know, that New York doesn't get credit for, you know, their defense. Just they are a good defensive team. I'll have to watch it but I felt like we got some good opportunities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, yeah. We just need to score the ball a couple times. Just a couple times. We were up four. Like I said, that JJ three sort of changed things for them, right. If we get that stop and we just score one or two more times, that's our game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's a hard-fought game, right. Really great game. That's one that, you know, we convert just a couple and it's our game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"So, our defense, and like the things that you mentioned, we did those things. We played well enough at that end. Obviously, it seems crazy to say when Stewie has 30 but you know, she had 38, 39 on us and they only scored 78, 79 points. We were right there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,For sure. For sure. That's what we just talked about. This is Phee's first Finals. So she's feeling these things for the first time. K-Mac has been there.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"The hardest thing to do, I imagine you guys feel it when you are watching, there's so many ups and downs and swings and all around, and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to sort of weather those swings, and here we are. We're disappointed. We're home. We played well and just couldn't come up with the win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's important that you don't get too high when you win and too low when you lose, and it's really hard. It's really, really hard but we've got to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home with our tremendous fans. And you know, we'll see what we can do on Friday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it feels great. I mean, that's something that -- obviously it's the ultimate goal is to be here and to get a win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Doesn't feel great right now, obviously, with a loss. But I am excited to look at film and see what we can do better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it feels amazing. The crowd was awesome. To play at home in the Finals is such a rush. So definitely looking forward to the next game.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Her contributions today, she was back to being BC for us. So we were glad to see that, and we'll continue that into game four."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,That was just a great All WNBA Second-Team performance laughter. That's it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I mean, you know, in the time-out, Sandy kind of was just like, you're going to shoot this shot. You know, I feel like I was able to get a little separation in range and get a really good shot to go. Obviously wanting to let the shot clock wind down. And got the space that I needed to get my feet under me and felt comfortable taking that shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn't. I've practiced that shot a thousand times in my head, on the court, and I feel like that's just something that as athletes, you put yourself in that position to want to be able to make a shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"And obviously like we don't win this game without Stewie. What she was able to do, just continued to chip away. Obviously she'll speak, but I mean, yeah, there's nothing I could say. Like that shot's nice but that doesn't go against what she's been able to do for us tonight and how she was able to just will us back into that game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we were all kind of just waiting for our moment. You know, waiting for the script to flip a little bit. You know, they talked about it. They talked about first five minutes, going to come out punching. They punched us in the face in the first quarter and we continued to wear them down."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We knew that our pace was something that made them tired and for me, it was just kind of like I was motivated. I was mad. And I liked my matchups that I had, and really kind of attacking them to make sure that we could get this back into where we needed to be for it to be a ballgame."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Just continuing to kind of be in help side and know that we did some different schemes. We sometimes were sending two to the ball and then leaving somebody open and making sure that, you know, between JJ and I, like we are going to protect the rim at all costs and make sure that nothing is easy, because this is the Finals and everything is going to be tough and we're going to make everybody work for it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,That's why I can't be miked up.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I'm not sure exactly what the situation was. Might have been when it was 71-69, because I feel like we were at that score for a long time. But just I could feel it. You know, you could feel the momentum was shifting to our side."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"They were up and their shots weren't falling. We were getting good looks, and it's like, if we are going to be this close, we are not leaving here without this win. It's tough to play in this arena, but the way that we continued to stay together is something that I'm not shocked at but I am really proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,I was mad we were losing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We know we're one game away from winning the championship, and I think that they are going to give us their best shot. They are going to give everything they have got, and you know what, so are we. The turnaround is quick but we are going to continue to be ready. There's a lot of things that we didn't do right tonight and have a kind of quick memory. I think that we're happy we got this win but we're -- the job's not done."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I just went up and gave him a big shot. Him and Jodie Berry, our assistant coach came down and he kind of told me the same thing, like there was never a doubt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Obviously him, Sandy, all the coaches that I've had, just their continued belief and pouring into me means the world to me whether I make or miss that shot. Like the fact that they kind of trusted me to go out there and make big shots, that's why I love playing for this team and continue to pour my all."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's pretty special. It was never in doubt. Obviously Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there, but I thought the right time, this is Sabrina. She just made a big shot. She's a great shooter and she just needed a little bit of separation."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, definitely the biggest shot of my career and hopefully not the last."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,It did. Pretty nice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Not for us. I think that, you know, this feels like we're playing on their home court, and I feel like each game is so different. You know, you go from 1 to 2 to 3. But the way that we continue to fight and be resilient. I don't want to speak for you guys. Doesn't feel like Game 1 to me. Feels like Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"At this point, I don't know."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think -- well, I think the way that we fought back in the second, knowing that our offense didn't really click yet but we were able to limit them defensively. But then in the third, when we had a strong push, a strong punch. You guys know the first two games, our third quarters have been a struggle to score offensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We were getting downhill. We were attacking and we were being confident. If a mistake happened, like a turnover or a missed shot or like something just doesn't go our way, we didn't panic. We continued to play and continued to fight through it because we know how big this moment is. We have the experience of the good, bad, ugly, and different."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, we didn't come out how we wanted to start the game. We knew they'd threw the first punch. I thought we weren't playing how we wanted to play physically, mentally with the pace and everything. But credit to them. They were taking us out of stuff that we wanted to do and they were making big shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I trust this team. I feel like we've grown so much. We've handled adversity even from Game 1, you know what I mean? It's like, okay, this is a totally different game here and we just had to chip away."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I did. I felt confident. Even with that last shot I felt confident, okay, because we worked hard and we found a way to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think that what the big three means is between Sab, JJ and myself, we know when it's our time to step up and to make an impact. And over the course of the game, it's like sometimes things are hard. Sometimes things are frustrating. I pick up two fouls in the first quarter. But knowing that our team trusts and believes in us to be in this position to take these shots, to help get the game in the right place, but at the same time we wouldn't be here without our teammates, and having that trust and belief just gives us confidence."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't know. Like, you guys talk about the run, Sab's shot. There was so many players that came in that were like such an important piece of what we were able to do tonight just because they made Minny tired and that's what makes this team really special. It's a collective win even though some of us are shining a little bit brighter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I think it's important to just read the game, and being able to get downhill and find JJ on a really important basket that, helped us late in the game. Because you're just not really one-dimensional. The defense doesn't know what you're going to do Are you going to shoot it are you going to pass it? Are you going to be a screener, a decoy? There's just so many opportunities that when you have the gravity we have to be able to make it tough on the defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"JJ was huge for us. The way that she protected the rim, hit a huge three, hit that layup, like just continue to go chip away, and it was a total team effort. Like Stewie said, we're not here without every single person on this team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,Just in the locker room waiting on Stewie. I would say I really didn't realize how far out I was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, like I kind of, you know, wasn't sure if I was dribbling with my right or left hand and then I was like, oh, yeah, I did hit that step-back."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I just didn't really realize how far I was, but like I said, it's a shot that I take often and I take in practice and that I take before the game. It's not like a Hail Mary, hope this goes in. It's like, once I got it off, I was like, yeah, this is in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I was really, really happy with Nyara. It was the plan to give her a few more extra minutes tonight. Stewie came in a little sooner because Stewie got two fouls early."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She played so hard. She was winded by the end of those seven minutes. We played her seven minutes in a row but she was so effective. Just the ability, they were being so aggressive, and what Nyara brings is she's always on her front foot getting downhill. She's always going to run the floor, just a hundred miles an hour, which is what we needed."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So it's been great to see her growth, and yeah, it was never in doubt there. But obviously I went to Slooty early, too, and I thought that changed the pace of the game. We struggled a little bit. Not often do I sit both of these at the same time, very rarely. But I felt like we needed to at that moment, and I think they gave us really good energy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We got it back to ten after that first quarter, and I think that was the thing. We've got to keep grinding, keep grinding, and as the game went on, we got back to playing Liberty Basketball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Our offense was bad at a time when we really needed it. Our pace was slow. Taking too long to get into things, and you know, I don't think we were terribly hard to play against from that standpoint. And that was obviously a difficult time to be doing that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm disappointed that we let it get to 17. I'm more disappointed in that. I'm more than disappointed, I'm pissed that that happened again."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Sure, did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It's hard. You have to adjust to the refs. Definitely it's not an excuse. We played really bad. I'm definitely not using that as an excuse.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it's hard to adjust because you are playing one way and you are getting used to the refs and then they change it up. But that's not why we lost. It wasn't them. It was us. Can't blame that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,It's been talked about a lot. This is a group that problem solves well together. They never think they are out of it. Their belief in themselves and their belief in each other is top-notch. And we know it's a long game. They are very experienced.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"We just knew what we had to clean up, get some things cleaned up and we did that then. Put ourselves in position, right where we wanted to be and just couldn't get over the hump."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't think it affected the game. I don't know if it affected her play. Phee can answer that. It was a chance to get her three minutes of rest and at the end of the quarter, that was fine, and then she went back in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,So it didn't affect us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Huge difference. So both games they have gotten help from part of their -- they have a big five, right, their starters are all very capable, just like our starters are all very capable and you need players beyond your stars, and for two games, they have done that. We're having trouble getting that consistently and we've got to have that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I mean, yeah, obviously you want to steal one on the road. We're really disappointed I think in how we played today but excited to go home and play in front of our crowd, and we have to respond. We have to come out playing better than we did in these two games."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's hard. Like we are both competing for a championship. You have to play with a level of desperation from the very beginning, and so that's what we're going to need to do to come out in Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I honestly don't feel like I changed my mindset. I feel like I stayed aggressive on defense. I was frustrated that I had those four fouls but I don't think it affected me in the way that I was playing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"No, I happen to agree with you. I had a chance to talk to Joe Ingles, I don't know if I told Lan this when we were in Minnesota, and he asked me how I liked my Australian. And we talked about all the ways that we love the way that Lan plays and her level of compete, and that's what Joe said. He's like, one thing you're darned sure an Australian is going to do is compete their tails off."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"And Lan is the very definition of that. Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how difficult it is. Lan is always there for us in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"We were trying to get another ball handler out there, somebody they had to pay attention to, try to get downhill a little bit, try to create some easier opportunities playing with flow. Setups weren't necessarily producing anything for us, so we just thought, spread the floor and play with two ball handlers."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Well, I mean, what did she have at half, 12? Ten of them were in fast break. Ten of them were fast break. So what changed is she wasn't able to get it in the fast break and we had her in the halfcourt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,I think Stewie is the same. I don't think making her missing a shot or free throw. We do this long enough that those things happen. She's resilient. She played exactly like we thought she would. I thought she played great in Game 1.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"And so you know, I think her impact defensively was something that we felt. You know, what did she have, seven steals? And so you know, she's been doing that in these playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"More than that, in my mind -- you have to ask Stewie, but I don't think that's what was on her mind. I think what was on their collective minds is it's a must-win game for them and they came out and played like it was, and they took the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, but I think the opponent has a fair amount to do with it. We have to come up with better opportunities and better things that we can do offensively so that we can get back to a little bit more of a balanced scoring."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,So I think that's most important to say is New York has had a lot to do with this.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"You've got players that are playing a lot of minutes, a lot of heavy minutes, and any time you can get your bench to come in and be productive and you can keep them out there longer, that's an advantage."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"But I don't think either bench has been necessarily a separator. We talked about Hiedeman in the last game. She scored it. I think she had ten, right. So that was impactful."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"But you know, both teams are looking for anywhere else you can go so that you don't have all this pressure on your top players."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"What we continued to keep saying to one another was like stay together, keep playing. Every rebound matters. And even if our offense gets a little bit stagnant and funky, we are not going to let that dictate what we do defensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, massive. They have been going under on screens so we encouraged her to shoot the three. She's a great three-point shooter. She was stroking it yesterday in practice before the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, she was digging deep and that's what we needed. We knew we needed to bounce back and it was a big bounce-back game. They contained Leonie a little bit after what she did in Game 1 but B helped us get this margin to win the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. Just like not letting history repeat itself and knowing that Game 1 happened but now, you know, how can we control Game 2 and I think that honestly the thought process was, we were trying to be up a little bit more. Like not letting them get to the three-point line to set up their offense. And then in to out, whether I'm helping, I know that Sab or whoever else is helping on my backside, and making them have to move just a little bit quicker than they want to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"No. Honestly -- sorry, I'll just rant laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I kind of texted him and I was like, you know what it's about time that you come to my game. I've been here for two years and he hasn't come down. What are you doing? Yeah, CD Dailey came and she got that same message, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a long drive.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,Two hours.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B brings is this grit, this toughness, knowing that -- and all of us know, she's giving us whatever she's got, and the way that she continued to be aggressive, they were going under on her and she knocked that thing down with confidence, got into the paint, drive and kicks."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,But that's what we're used to. We know she can do this and happy to see her get into a good rhythm with everything that's been up and down this season and know that she's a big factor in everything we do.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think that the first thing was higher pick-up points, knowing that if Leo was going to be up, really trying to limit Courtney Williams, then I need to be there, too. So when Phee is dribbling up it's without any pressure."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"That's really what my goal was, was just take what the defense gives me and not forcing anything but understanding I'm going to be able to drive and kick. And players hit, multiple players hit really big shots. But obviously I think coming out like that was great for us to get going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"And then in the second half, they made some adjustments and I think it was understanding being able to drive passing lanes and find the open man, if they are going to bring a few on the ball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,So I just did that. I don't always need to be looking to score every single time I have the ball. Just continue to make the right read and understanding what it is that provides our best offense as a team.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think everyone has seen her. She's been struggling but she's been feeling good these last few days, can tell you that much. She has been."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We just knew it was a bit of time. We've given her so much rest here and she was ready to go. She puts the work in. Like I said, she's tough. We talked about the grittiness that she gives us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But it's great that you put the ball in her hand and be more of a playmaker, because it takes a little bit more pressure off these two in particular. I thought that was very effective for us. But her defense, she was everywhere. She was guarding everyone. I'm really happy for her. We just have to freshen up and get ready for the next game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B and I were continuing to say in the huddles was defensively, you know, the schemes because they went small. So it means our matchups are a little bit different. And making sure that we have each other's help. If we are weak side, who is high, who is low. Just those type of things, and knowing that like scores and stops, we're playing the long game in the last two minutes, and making sure that we are all are on the same page."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I mean, I think we missed her grittiness and just she's the ultimate competitor. She takes pride -- she used to always guard the best player and obviously now we have Leo, too, that makes us really a versatile defensive team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But you also miss her play-making. That's something we talked about this year. We wanted to make sure she could play-make more and it was hard for to play-make when she was hobbling around with the knee. We need her to get confidence first, and then to go out and play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She's just impactful because she plays at both ends of the floor, and plays hard, and she's a winner. So happy that she got the success tonight and keep building on it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Well, I'm not from here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Geno. Vivian, has been here for B. It's great."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a full house tonight. It was really loud.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,Largest crowd ever.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Loudest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,BREANNA STEWART Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,She's not from here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,I'm not from here. Loudest? Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'm not from here. It's great. We talked about the winner is women's basketball, WNBA. So many fans coming out to watch these amazing players play, but yeah, they are all welcome. All coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,My coach is coming to Minnesota.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,Okay. Kelly is coming.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,SABRINA IONESCU Go Ducks.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think the moment the game ended Thursday night, I was looking forward to Sunday, just to be able to kind of change things, change the narrative a little bit, and know that I'm going to come out and be the same that I was and be obviously better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But throughout this entire process, my team has my back every step of the way and was just excited to have another opportunity to go to battle with them. Because we have a lot of fun in everything that we do, and you know, it's not always like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"It was the difference in this last game. I think that especially after watching the film of Game 1, we slowed down to a pace that is a little bit awkward for us. We want to play fast and we want to move the ball and we want to get downhill and we want to score, obviously."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"So making sure that no matter what, we continue to play fast, we get good shots and we get that defense moving."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Understanding how teams are playing me and being able to make that adjustment in real time. Possession by possession, quarter by quarter, teams have kind of changed the way they have guarded, whether they are switching, hedging, trapping. And I think being able to just be poised and understanding what it is that I need to do in order to create an advantage for the team that we have out there on the floor is what I've always wanted to do, and I feel like I've been able to do that in a really good spot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,Obviously my teammates set really good screens and are able to get me open in order for me open to create for them.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"I'd say it worked pretty well for us, understanding that we use our big lineup and knowing that, you know, we can get the ball inside. We can switch. We're able to apply pressure defensively with our length and being able to get steals and just disrupt their flow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"But obviously it's a series and it's a chess match and they are going to throw different adjustments, and I think our ability to stay poised and being able to kind of see what it is that they are doing in real time is going to be crucial."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,Now we have seen their small ball lineup and we're going to go back and find ways that we can execute while they have that group on the floor.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we weren't happy the way we played we and we talked about our principles of play. We have it on our wall, there's a way that we want to play when we are at out best, when we are at pace and moving it, setting good screens and getting second and third side when we need it, but with a good inside-outside attack. We came out, and I think that was very effective for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,We always want to try to get the ball to JJ. They bring a lot of congestion and we probably would have liked to put it in more cleaner in some areas but she demands so much attention down there. I thought the are best thing was obviously just getting on the boards. I think she was fantastic for us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And that's what we need. You know, some games you are going to get more touches than other games and shoot but it's more about playing in the right way and sharing the ball and good to great. I think shot selection wasn't great last game. So it's about making those adjustments and continue to play the way that we want to play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was thinking no, no, she's up -- no, no, she's going to shoot it. But a three-point shot is a layup for her. We encourage her to shoot all those threes. I know she missed one just before it. But I love the confidence that she brings."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We talk about her being a rookie. She's not really a rookie. She has this experience in really big moments and the mindset to handle this atmosphere extremely well, and to make a play like that, I mean, I love it. She's an amazing player and an amazing human being."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, you know, I think kind of piggybacking off of the question that I answered from Pepper, it's understanding when I'm getting into the paint, the defense has to make a decision. They are either going to come and take me or they are going to play, you know two on one on the back side, and there's Leo and B in the corner, and as a defender, you just have to take your pick between the two."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"I was able to just drive in, look her off, and obviously B -- a corner three for B is a layup as well. She shoots that at a really high clip and really well. So I kind of baited Alanna Smith into thinking I was going to pass it high. And B hit a huge shot for us that changed the momentum of the game and continued to extended the lead. I think they called a time-out a little bit after that. It was huge for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"We believe in her. She knows that. This was a huge game. She played a huge role in the game ending up the way that it did and she's going to continue to do it for these next two games, we know that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I think we've been in these moments before on opposing court when it gets really, really loud, and it's more about making sure we stay true to who we are. We kind of know how we want to play. We know that they are going to make runs. We know the crowd is going to get into it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But we've just got to continue to play -- stay true to who the New York Liberty are, and if we can do that, we can overcome any obstacle."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We have had great starts in both games, but I thought our -- how much they were talking in the huddle, you know, it wasn't just me talking all the time. They're going ""We have got to rebound. The possession game."""
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just thought, when we play like that, with the pace that we went out and just the effort and the energy we put into the defensive side with the scramble and the help, good things happen. It was just more about staying persistent."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We kept Minnesota to 27 points in that second half, that's pretty good. And some of our scramble defense, we were down 1-0. So you know, we should be playing like that. And now we can tidy up some things and they can tidy up some things as well, too. We'll look forward to playing another tough game on Wednesday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I mean, I think we embrace it. We like it when it's loud. We like it when it's difficult. You know, as we did tonight when it's so loud that you can't hear, you know, just expecting that when we go to Minnesota, hopefully it's going to be an incredible atmosphere for both of those games."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But just continuing to stick together, and I think also, the biggest thing behind it is like not getting too high or too low, you know. Things are going to seem bigger than what they are because they are playing at home, and I'm sure Minnesota said the same thing when they are playing here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But yeah, we like to go on the road."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, obviously I stayed up watching the game, not too late laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"But it was a nail-biter. But I mean, after they won the way that they did, today I was like, yeah, I'm going to wear my Oregon shoes because I wanted to embody that tough, gritty win that they pulled off, which is probably one of the biggest wins that our program has had there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"A lot of things didn't go right for them and they just continued to fight and stay together and grind out a really big win. I was like, all right, I want to bring that energy with me today on the court and kind of do the same thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,So I think I'm going to wear the same shoes again on Wednesday.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,Lucky shoes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,We are the first team in WNBA playoff history to be down 15 and come back and win the game. So that ranks really high.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it defines our team in terms of being able to get through difficult times. That's what we say, we've been talking about, all these interviews we've been given, that's what we are talking about You have to be mentally tough and resilient. You have to look inward and not blame other people, and give each other confidence."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"And we were that team. You know, thrilled that we could hang in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I mean, he believes in us like we believe in ourselves. I think we have such a tight-knit circle with our families involved as well, and we all know what we can do in that. We never give up."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,He embodies all of our families. They all believe that we can come back and we can win and we can stay composed and hopefully win. The basketball gods were on our side tonight.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"Honestly, whatever the folks want to call me, I'm with whatever. As long as they're showing love. If you show me love, you can call me whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"That's just a testament to how we believe in each other. We have so many great three-point shooters, and the fact that these girls are out here trying to get me the ball, I mean, I could cry. This is amazing. I love it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I say that all the time, and I don't say that for fun. These people I'm around, we believe in each other so much. It's crazy, man. I'm happy to be here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"From a basketball standpoint, Courtney recognized that she had to get more aggressive. Not pick up her dribble. Her team needed her to be aggressive to go score the basketball. We needed some help. Phee got going as well. But Courtney has been around for a while. She has been in Finals games, and she knows her team needed her to get aggressive."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I think just taking it one possession at a time. We've been in situations where we've been down before, and that's when we really lean on our defense. That's something we were talking about, getting three stops in a row, chipping at it a little bit at a time. Not thinking about the point difference, but thinking about the possession that we need to get a stop and a score. That's just what we were talking about at halftime."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Just every game, I try to go out and impact defensively. Especially when they are going on a run like that, they have amazing offensive players, and so trying to be as disruptive as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It just goes in preparation. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us and playing tendencies and just playing defense.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Again, they are great offensive players. They are going to make plays. I just have to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I don't know where it ranks. It's 1 right now because we are here. I like to be where my feet are planted. So it's 1 right now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy she made a clutch free throw, if you go and look --"
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,Laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"That helped her a little bit, clutch free throws, that was good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I messed that up laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't feel that way. Those are your words.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"We know it's a long series. Nothing is won in the first quarter. It was not the first quarter that we were hoping for. What our narrative was in the timeouts was just we had to find our footing. Find our footing defensively, and we did the second quarter. We held them to 12 after giving up 32. We went into halftime in good shape."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"No question about it, the second-chance points are really, really disappointing. That could have really cost us, and we were very, very fortunate that we overcame that. But defensively, we knew what we had to get done. Once our offense improved a little bit and we stopped turning the ball over."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,But they played terrific. I thought New York played terrific. Their pace was terrific. They run so many great things. They are unique in what they do. They found JJ repeatedly. She had a tremendous game. We had to overcome a lot.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"And then you look up at the end, and you know, we held them below 40 percent, which is monumental. A lot of that was obviously late. We got big stops when we needed them. Repeatedly, whether ball is going out of bounds or 5050 balls, referees, whatever happens, jump balls, fouls, all that stuff, we just had to be gritty at the end. We had to get stops to win and that's what I'm proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"Well said. Alanna is one of our highest WARP players, if you're into analytics. She's one of our highest. You know, like you said, she's not going to wow you. She's not going to fly around, scoring the ball, making post moves. It's not her. But what she does for our team, both offensively and defensively, it's not underappreciated, I can tell you that. It's a little bit understated. People have to really watch to recognize what she does for us. Fighting through. Every night, she's playing against the opposing team's big, and she's not big. And so if you look at the success that she has in doing that, it's the reason why we're sitting here today in the Finals. She's Second Team All-Defense, along with Collier as Defensive Player of the Year. Those two are the heart and soul of our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"No, it is the margin. It is the margin. But I hear what you're saying, in that when it mattered, we got some hustle plays. And we always say, you never know which one is going to be the difference between winning and losing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"That last possession, I think we learned from an earlier playoff game when we were down how we wanted to play that last possession. And so being aggressive and getting the three ball and do what we had to do, if one didn't go in, you know, get as many chances as we could get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"If the bigs weren't rebounding, might as well go small. Couldn't get any worse, right? What we wanted was a couple ball handlers, get downhill, try to get some easier stuff and pace, etc. That was actually, I don't know if it was Katie Smith or Rebekkah Brunson, but it was something that they asked for and it was a really good call."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it felt like we got a second chance. Obviously you don't want to be put in that position. Wish I wouldn't have fouled. Wish it wouldn't have been called, whatever it was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"But yeah, you're not thinking about that in the second. You're just thinking making sure they didn't get the rebound, making sure we're boxing out and going to our next play. So yeah, that's what I was thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I didn't know she was here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"She was texting to the bench. A lot of the good stuff we did, she was sending laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"The games that we were talking about, we were up. We were managing leads. We weren't finishing well. The fundamental difference is we were down. So obviously we finish games better when we're down, based on the playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"But that was what I was referring to, was managing leads better, playing all the way through to the end of the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,Welcome to Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. I'm excited to be here in New York City as the Liberty take on the Minnesota Lynx.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you all know, the Liberty and Lynx were the two best teams in the WNBA all year, with both at the top of the standings for much of the season. The Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, are making their second straight Finals appearance and looking to win their first WNBA championship. Obviously, they won the Commissioner's Cup the other year 2023. The Lynx, one of the most decorated franchises in WNBA history, are looking to win a league-record fifth title and are appearing in a record seventh Finals. They're looking to become the second team to sweep both the Commissioner's Cup and the WNBA Finals trophy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With Napheesa having such a career year, along with the play in New York with Sabrina and Stewie and the storylines about Leonie Fiebich, her first year in the league, All-Rookie Team, and free-agency signings in Minnesota with Courtney Williams and Alanna Smith and so many more storylines, I'm just excited to get this tipped off."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Finals mark the culmination of what I think is the most transformational year in the WNBA's history. You saw all the statistics we put out viewership, attendance, merch sales, digital engagement at or near record levels. To put it in perspective with a few stats that bring insight into what has happened, the WNBA has significantly outpaced the industry in average consumption of live games in 2024. Fans watched 30 percent more minutes on average of each WNBA game in the 2024 regular season."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our games reached a record 54 million viewers in the 2024 regular season. Younger, more diverse audiences are imperative to the growth of the sports industry, and they flocked to the WNBA this season. Viewership by fans under 35 increased 211 percent, led by a 259 percent increase in viewership from Gen Z and millennial women."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our focus on our direct-to-consumer platforms led to record-breaking content consumption and repeated fan engagement. WNBA App downloads surpassed 1 million this year, and monthly active users skyrocketed 252 percent. Social engagement increased nearly 300 percent across all of our league channels. There was an astounding 872 percent increase in WNBA App story views, which I know I watch my kids watching all the little stories that we put out there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Last time we gathered for the Finals, in 2023, we had just announced the Golden State expansion franchise. Since then, we have announced two more expansion teams to begin play in 2026, Toronto and Portland, with one more team to begin play by no later than the 2028 season, to get us to 16 teams."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This summer we signed a groundbreaking media rights deal that will grow the economics of our league and expand the reach and accessibility of our game for our fans, with additional WNBA media deals to come."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you know, early in the season, after seeing the growth trajectory we were on and with a challenging game footprint given the Olympics, we implemented full charter flights for the entire season plus playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This growth has not come without growing pains. The hateful speech and threats directed at our players are troubling. That type of conduct is not representative of the WNBA's character or fan base. As a league, we stand united in condemning racism and all forms of hate. The WNBA is one of the most inclusive and diverse professional sports leagues in the world, and we will continue to champion those values."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll meet with the Players Association, the players, teams. We'll work together to expand and enhance our efforts and are going to approach this multidimensionally, utilizing technology, prioritizing mental health, reinforcing physical security and increasing monitoring. We know there's more work to be done, and as a league, we are fully committed to listening to the players and other stakeholders on this and other important issues."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Finally, before we get to your questions, we have some news to announce Starting next year with the 2025 WNBA season, the WNBA Finals presented by YouTube TV will be a best-of-seven format, replacing the current best-of-five format. The Finals will take on a 2-2-1-1-1 structure, in which the team with the higher seed will host Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, and its opponent will host Games 3, 4 and 6. This will give our fans a championship series format that they are accustomed to seeing in other sports."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We will also be changing our first round to a 1-1-1 setup for the best-of-three series. We have contemplated both these changes since the pandemic. We would have done it in the current year, but with the Olympic break this year, it wasn't possible. But now that we have charters throughout the season and playoffs, it's feasible. So to summarize, in 2025 we will have a best-of-three first round, five in the semifinals and seven in the WNBA Finals."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"In addition, the 2025 regular season will increase from 40 to 44 games per team. Honestly, the league's growth and increased demand for WNBA basketball made this the ideal time to expand the schedule, lengthen the Finals and provide fans more opportunities to see the best players in the world compete at the highest level."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I also want to take the opportunity to let you know that the WNBA Draft Lottery 2025 presented by State Farm will be broadcast on Sunday, November 17, at 5 p.m. Eastern on ESPN."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, I want to thank you for your coverage this year. It really has made a difference. I really am very grateful to be standing here as the commissioner of a league that has been through so much. To have you all in this room and reporting on this league as you have all year, very grateful for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, happy to answer any questions."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, first of all, there's no place in sports for this. Just continue to condemn it, continue to be a voice on this. Also, I think we have been already meeting with some technology providers. I think there are some technology solutions out there that we could deploy and employ. Of course, we want to meet with the players and see what they want to do around that. But there are some technology companies we've been meeting with to see what we can do. It just is something where we have to continue to be a voice for this, a voice against it, condemning it, and making sure that we find every opportunity to support our players, who have been dealing with this for much longer than this year, by the way. I think Sue Bird said that the other day very eloquently. We need to continue to see how we can support the mental health resources, physical security, cybersecurity."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're going to attack it, as I said, multidimensionally. We're going to try to figure out how we can best work with the players as to how they want us to help solve this issue."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, well, next year we do not have any international competition. No FIBA World Cup and no Olympic break, so we should have a nice footprint. It's hard to start much earlier because we obviously have the college season. The college draft is such a great feeder system into the WNBA and creates a lot of excitement, as you've seen over the past few years and probably since the league started."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think probably not starting much earlier. Certainly we're well into October by the time we finish the Finals, especially if we go to five games this year, next year seven. So we'll probably go a little bit later in October."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But again, we'll have a decent footprint next year to fit in the 44. Remember, we have an additional team joining next year, in Golden State Valkyries. So I think it'll be great. We'll have obviously the condensed Commissioner's Cup a few weeks, culminating in that championship, as well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think next year will be a good footprint. We'll have to look at the following year because that is the FIBA World Cup year. Obviously, we'll be good in 2027, and then it'll be LA '28. It's a constant balancing of the schedule. I think we feel very good about where we'll be next year, for sure, on the footprint."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So that date in November was draft lottery, not the draft. Yes."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Golden State Valkyries will pick fifth in each round. The lottery picks will be the four teams that you probably have already done the calculations on, but we'll obviously put a release out after this press conference on exactly that, and then the Golden State Valkyries will have the fifth pick in each round."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's a good question on what's next as it relates to our globalization platform. Obviously, we played Toronto, we played in Edmonton. That was kind of our Canada series. Now we'll have a team in Toronto starting in '26. Sure, we'd like to play in more places -- EMEA, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America, I know Mexico City has shown interest, as well as a variety of other cities across the world."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, I was in Paris for the Olympics this year. Thought it was amazing, the support for women's basketball there. I'll never forget on the Friday night when Belgium played France in the women's game. I'd say that was the best crowd that I saw watch a game there. Obviously, a lot of Belgians could drive there to Paris."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It was great to see the growth of the game globally. I think our players represent such great role models to those communities in lifting women. I've admired what the NBA has done with their Global Games platform, playing around the world. I think we'll be on a path there as we get into 2025 and beyond."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That will be something I'm sure in collective bargaining that we'll sit down with the players and Players Association. I think one thing that you noticed in the last year or two, particularly this year, a lot of our veterans were in camp, training camp. Obviously, they have to show up by May 1, and I think it was important. I think you saw the quality of the game in the first few weeks because of that. I also think you saw the quality of the Commissioner's Cup play, which is toward the front half of the season to give that some more relevance. Again, I'm sure it'll be something we continue to discuss and talk about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so again, we work with FIBA. We're working with all the constituents on how we can make this all work, where they can have vibrant, competitive seasons. We can have our vibrant, competitive season."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, some have moved their dates to end earlier to make sure that those vets -- remember, our prioritization rule does not apply to rookies in their first couple years, but for those vets to come over and play in the best league in the world."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But we have a good relationship with FIBA. Working through with them. And again, I think in 2025 -- that's another impediment to starting earlier, to the question about starting earlier, not only the college draft and college season going into the beginning of April, we need to have a training camp, but also the Euro leagues, as well, play into April now, into May."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think on balance, I think we all want to grow the game globally. I think it's going to come down to footprints and seasons and how we can do it, which is why most of what we're doing in expanding our season will be on the back end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, absolutely. We're always scenario planning around a variety of different outcomes. Certainly, I engage with Nneka and Terri throughout the year, every month, every other week during the season. I really respect the player leadership. I think this is going to be an opportunity to listen to one another and take this league to the next level for generations to come."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We actually look forward to engaging in that now that we've kind of gotten the media deal we discussed, corporate partners, just everything. There's virtually not a sporting event you can turn on where one of our players is not in an ad spot. That was not happening five years ago. Look at Aliyah Boston and Sabrina and A'ja and so many of our players in these ad spots. I think that's a good sign, too, as we think about the future of this game and the future of the agreement between the Players Association and the owners."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, one thing that as a very long-term sports fan I know is that officiating and refereeing is always at the top of the fan's list, of the media's list. Obviously, we work hard on training. We work hard on consistency. Obviously, not every -- they're humans."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Looking at technology, basketball is a little more complex than tennis, for instance, around technology, of officiating. We're looking at a variety of different dimensions, but we'll continue training. We have a lot of veteran officials. You'll see them out here working the Finals. But we always know there's always work to do, always get better. We review in our Competition Committee meetings, officiating and points of emphasis and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll caucus with Bethany Donaphin, our head of league operations, and our referee operations, as well. We'll caucus to make sure we're putting out the best officiating we can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But I know it's a passionate issue. Every fan group -- I love when I go into market and every fan group I meet with, they usually wait and ask it as the last question of the night. But they do ask about officiating, which I appreciate the passion for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So on your first question, we do hear from NBA players who are very interested in investing in WNBA teams. There's a lot of capital inflow coming into women's sports, as many of you are hearing and reading, and obviously we were one of the first and only to raise at the scale we did, 75 million back in 2022. We brought in former NBA players into that capital raise and former WNBA players into that capital raise. So yes, we do get interest from time to time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now, the NBA investments by those players is in independent teams, not in NBA-affiliated teams. So if you're still playing for an NBA team, you probably want to invest in the WNBA team with your affiliate, and you can't do that until you graduate, I'll call it, or retire from basketball. So we have a lot of interest from that perspective."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Then again, we want to listen to the players as to how they want to think about anything that we go to the bargaining table on, whether that's equity stakes or other issues that they might be interested in. We're certainly willing to listen. I think it is complicated when you have a Players Association versus the league versus the owners who are all small businesses, right. Well, 13, now we'll have 15 to 16, and they're each individual businesses. I think it's a little more complicated because there's no one equity stake. Like Unrivaled, it is one league with equity stake in, and it's not teams. We've got 12, soon to be 16, teams in a league. So it's a little more complicated, I think."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that we look at for all of our teams every year, as well as you mentioned the expansion teams. I think my comments on the expansion teams were you want to make sure the expansion owners know, when you come into the league, it's a competitive league. Free agency is competitive now, and all of our owners are investing. You see investing in practice facilities and other player experiences. I think we want those expansion teams to come in and be the most successful they can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, you may have a different view, but I think our current owners are all growing in the same direction as far as how they know they need to get free agents to build a championship squad. Obviously great rookies, too, become veterans later on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I don't have a bias against any one team. Obviously, we have teams playing in different size arenas. You saw some teams upgrade those arenas for certain games this year, and I thought that was a sign and signal that as has attendance had a grown across the league that we can play in bigger arenas. I think when I came into this league, someone said you should all be playing in 5,000-seat arenas. Can you imagine what you're going to see out here tonight if that was in a 5,000-seat arena? No, there's going 17,000-plus people here. And we had our highest-attended game ever, over 20,000, in Washington this year."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we do have standards, by the way, across the board for facilities, practice facilities and things like that. The owners now know that there's an edge to showing a player investment in the things like facilities, et cetera, especially practice facilities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I was in Phoenix for the All-Star Game this year taking a tour of their new practice facilities that they opened. Vegas has done it, Seattle has done it, Dallas is going to do it. I think Phoenix I mentioned, and Chicago is looking at upgrading. I think all of our -- we already had some great practice facilities already in the league in Indy, Minnesota, et cetera, and here in New York."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, again, there's no -- we do have standards, but there's nothing where we're saying any one owner is not up to their standards today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so just in general for the 16th spot, as I've mentioned, the good news is we have a lot of demand from many cities. I'd say 10 or so, maybe even plus at this point, because I think the more people are watching the WNBA and seeing what we're growing here and seeing these players and the product on the court, more people are interested in having it in their cities. They see the economic impact of having a WNBA team in their city, the role model in the community these players represent."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I've said Philly is on the list, and Philly is on the list. Now that we have the three teams, two in '26, one next year, we're not in a huge rush. We'd like to bring it in in '27 or no later than '28, as I mentioned. So I'd say there's 10 to 12 cities that are very viable that we're evaluating, and we have a process. I'd say I don't have a deadline by which we have to name it because it'll be out to '27 or '28, but I would think in the next couple months or so we'll start -- now as we get into the offseason, we'll start taking a look at those that will go to the top of the list through our process."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, it's all the same types of things I've been talking about for the other three around arena, practice facility, player experience, committed long-term ownership group, city, demographics, psychographics, Fortune 500 companies based there. All the things we've been looking at in all of our cities and our data analysis. And then we've built some good relationships with some of the potential cities as they've started to engage with the league on an expansion team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think if you look at the diversity of when we did our capital raise, you'll see a fair amount of diversity in the ownership group we brought in there, investor group."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, we talk with our owners all the time about diversity in the coaching ranks, in their front office, back office, et cetera. You see every year we score very well in our report on that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We have a lot of assistant coaches that have been previous WNBA players and represent a very diverse group, as well. We have all of our owners partnering with minority-owned businesses. We partner at the league with Mielle, who is one of our newer partners. Playa Society. I think one of our teams just got a Partake Foods jersey patch that's a minority-owned business."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're looking at it from all these angles, partnerships, ranks of our employee base and certainly the coaching diversity and coaching, as well. So it is important to us. There's not a Board of Governors meeting that we don't talk about this. As you know, we've made enormous progress especially in the assistant coaching ranks with former WNBA players by essentially focusing on this over the last couple years. Made enormous progress, which is why our report card is really good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But it's something that you can never rest on, so I appreciate the question. We've had a couple coaches exit, so I think we have three open coaching spots. Obviously, the Golden State Valkyries announced their first head coach in their franchise history today. We have three open coaching spots. So we'll certainly be looking for our owners to have a diverse pool of candidates, and ultimately they'll make the decision on their head coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"We just take it on the chin, you know. We were up a lot and then we had a wild kind of sequence to end the fourth. Didn't start overtime great. I had a great look at the end and I didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"But I think that this is a series. We wanted to really win, obviously, for home court. But the beauty is, we have another game on Sunday and we'll be ready."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, it's probably a lot of things. I could probably give you a better answer tomorrow. I just thought we went away from our principles of play. I think we had a great first quarter, and then they lifted up the energy and they outhustled us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think we forced some of the action. We weren't moving it good enough. We couldn't get downhill as much. You know, we missed a lot of shots. We missed a lot of shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Just the principles of play for us. How we want to play, get to the next action."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, defensively, I think they executed better than us. That's what it came down to. They executed better than us. They found a way to win. They made some big shots, timely shots when they needed to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,We're disappointed. We have to be better. We're a better team than what we showed today.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think it's pretty clear, JJ had an amazing game, and the way that she was aggressive from start to finish is exactly what we need."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we got a lot of looks. Like, 90 shots is a lot, and we missed them. I think just coming out and understanding the game plan a little bit better, and always being on our front foot. I felt like there was just a few situations, time and score toward the end of the game, that really hurt us. But collectively there's a lot of things that you could kind of look at and be like, well, this is one of the reasons why we lost."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they took us out of what we wanted to run. They were really aggressive. They were blowing up stuff. We couldn't get clear passes. We tried to go downhill and they would stunt and get back, and we just got a little bit stagnant. Then we had obviously -- I thought we were slow. We were up so you're trying to move the ball, but then we are slow in our speed, execution speed, and then it was making it easy for them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And they made plays. They made plays down the other end. Obviously we contested it -- we give them a three, a four-point play. Those things, they can break your back, and they did. We had our opportunities to win and we didn't finish it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We're disappointed. We have to go back to work. We have to freshen up. We have to look at how we can be better, and it's really just principles of play. Things that we have been great at all season long, we have to just refocus on them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think the missed free throw because we had an opportunity to go up one. But even still, at the end of overtime, I had probably one of my cleanest looks. Didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"I mean, they switched with us a little bit more to stop us from going downhill. I don't know, I think the weight of the game was more about us, like Sandy said, getting away from our principles versus what they did to kind of get us out of rhythm."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they were throwing different coverages at her, with the switching and she was trying to go probably a little bit too much one-on-one early. We've just got to move the ball and trust that the ball will come back to her in that regard and exploit it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We had a tough night. We had a tough shooting night. We all did. But what I know, Sabrina is a competitor. She'll get ready for Game 2 and come back strong."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I want to be taking these shots. I feel like knowing my teammates and that everyone has confidence in me is important. It's kind of like on to the next and still making sure I'm aggressive any time on the court. Obviously as a player, it's very frustrating. But bounce back for Game 2."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"It was a point of emphasis for us coming into the game, just to control the rebounding and really get on the boards and try to exploit them in that way. It's something that we're going to have to continue to do to be successful."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"But like Stewie and Coach said, we had a lot of opportunities to close the game out. A few things that we have to change and kind of be aware of moving forward, but still some things to build upon and things to learn from."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, a hundred percent. It's principles of plays at both ends. Being at the point of the screen, Kayla McBride is coming off and shooting it, and then letting them go downhill, pressuring and letting Hiedeman dribble by us and giving them too many easy looks where we should have been just a little bit smarter in our defense there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,Sometimes when we didn't rebound or we kind of -- we went to offensive rebound but we are out of position and they got easy layups in transition. So those really break your back.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Principles of play in the half court. Pace is there, but I think we got a little stagnant and a little tired. But credit to them. They were blowing us up and they were being really physical. They were very active. They were switching it, and then that took us out of it a little bit. We've got to be better and we will be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think it's, specifically to that play because they were reviewing the time, you're just focusing on making the shot. Making the first one. Making the first one. Making the first one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"And then the second one, the same. It's when you want to be thinking about nothing else. It definitely sucks to miss."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,I think just the start we did have. We put up 32 points. We were very intentional playing defense. We were making it really hard for them to score. Some easy baskets. We were making shots and moving the ball really quick.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,But they went to another level. So they kind of took us out of a rhythm. Not surprised us. We knew what they are capable of doing. But we've got to get back and just play Liberty basketball.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely a little bit anxious. A little bit nervousness in there, just because I had no idea where I was going. I kind of told my agent to keep it a secret from me. I just want to be surprised."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"For me, I just wanted to land somewhere that would develop me and kind of make me into the best basketball that I can be. I'm happy that I landed with Utah. Definitely excited. Felt relief when I heard my name called, so that's probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think the biggest way I fit in is just my versatility. When you come in at such a young age, and being able to play multiple positions and guard multiple positions, I really feel like that allows you to fit in with the dynamic of the team just because you can do so much and fit in with different needs. That's the biggest part."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,There's a lot of talented guys on that team. I could go down the list and do their whole lineup that I can fit in with. But the biggest thing is they are young and I could develop and learn with them and kind of build that young core. That's probably the part I'm most excited about with this team.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Just being himself really. I feel like that's how he differentiates himself on and off the court and really made a name for himself. Being himself includes not only his personality but also his work ethic and how hard he worked to get to where he is and where he is going to continue to go to.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I feel like just taking those aspects of his game and his mentality, how he approached every workout, every rep, every charity event, every media coverage, I feel like I can use that and take that with me and use it throughout my career. That's how I'm going to grow and develop."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"It's something we dreamed about. As kids, obviously we never really got to play against or with each other on the same team just because of the age difference. So I think being able to do that now is definitely a dream come true. I'm going to make sure I'm matched up on him when we're playing them. Make sure, tell Will, put me on Jalen Williams. That's the game plan."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think it just goes to show the type of parents I have and the type of people I have in my life and my family members, just the values they installed in both of us. That's why we ended up this way. So I know they are extremely proud watching us reach our dreams. That's the biggest thing for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"We practiced it a lot, I'm not going to lie. Two years ago, we messed it up. We were practicing for a few days, maybe even a week up until this point, to make sure we nailed it. Add a little flair to it. So we made up for it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I've just got baby steps into the fashion industry, I'm not going to lie to you. This is the first time I stepped out and wore something expensive. I think for me it might be something a little hobby I'll pick up, but I'm just starting to get into fashion and just starting to figure it out. I'll probably learn from him as I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, it's hard to say just because we play two different styles of basketball. I don't know what your definition of better is. I hope to become an elite two-way player, playing offense and defense and doing that at the highest level and being one of those elite two-way players in the NBA, as I go throughout my career."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I strive to be better than him. Obviously a little sibling rivalry, but we also play like completely different just with the way our bodies are built. So you know, that's the answer you're looking for."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely gaming. I would say gaming, for sure, is one of the biggest ones. Fashion, stepping into it a little bit."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I'm a huge movie guy. That's something I always been into. Just pick up a movie and watch it. I love cinematography, so that's definitely probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I like bowling and starting to pick up golf too. Have a lot more free time, so I can start getting good at golf and getting a routine for it. But definitely bowling is another activity I'm heavy on."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, probably. And a lot of family time. That's probably going to be a heavy dose of it, spend as much time as I can with friends and family, while also obviously staying locked in on basketball. But enjoying the moments with them before the season gets hectic and I'm going to be traveling all over the place."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, go to this afterparty. That's probably the biggest thing. I'm looking forward to enjoying that. Got all my closest friends and family there. I guess that's on my bucket list to enjoy."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"It was a surreal feeling. I mean, especially just sitting in that chair waiting, just to figure out which team was going to get me. For them to pick me, a lot of emotions were just going through me. I'm definitely blessed."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"All of them are hardworking. They push their players past their limits. I feel like that's the best place for me. Especially with me going there, I know they are going to push me past my limits, push me past that wall to be the best player that I can be and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"Well, like you said, they have their trust in Bam. So I feel like once they have trust with me, it comes with me showing them that in practice. I feel like that's something that would elevate my game, just having that trust in me that I go out and make the right plays."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"A lot of people go into the transfer portal for money. I went in there for the right fit and I found the right fit. That definitely helped my career. Going into my sophomore season, actually getting to know the coaches. Just learning more things about the team just before I made the decision."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,I've got to go with Drake. OVO. OVO.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, I think the more I develop, I'll definitely be able to initiate offense at the one. Played two and three before. I think playing in the NBA, playing around in practice, I think I'll start to get used to it more, and then I think I can really take that role to the next level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"I've never been to Toronto. I've never even been to Canada. But I know that it's a nice city in Canada, and all I really know is the building."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, the guards, we're a close group at Baylor. Every year, there's six guards. Y'all are competing against each other every day. Y'all are getting better watching a lot of film. We actually do call it Guard U."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,Me being the next one out is a blessing from God. I'm just super grateful to be in this position and I hope that I'm going to represent Baylor well.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, just excited to meet all the players and to speak to the coaches, to meet them, meet the front office. Just excited to go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, they are very incredible and talented. I'll try to fit in there. I'm young. I'll learn a lot probably. I'm really grateful for the opportunity."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"I did not visit Oklahoma. Every organization that I've been to, I met some really nice people. That is with Oklahoma, also. Very, very nice coach. GMs, everybody, I'm just excited to meet them in person and talk to them. And yeah, that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, it was great. But I had injuries, so sadly, I didn't play more. But I tried to take my time and to be with them, to talk with them, even with the injury."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"So yeah, I really enjoyed it there. I made some really good friends and friendships forever. But as I said, I'm sad that I didn't have that opportunity to play more with them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Just that I'm ready, that I'll give 150 percent of myself for every ball, every possession, every time on defense. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, I talked with Micic. He just told me everything the best about not just the Thunder, but the whole NBA. And of course, Durisic, Nikola and I got really close this year. I really enjoyed playing with him. It was easy, as I can say. I hope he will get drafted as high as possible."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,It meant a lot that I had him here. We were together in Miami. We shared some good memories at times. We visit some places. It's great to have him here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Not yet. I've been coming back slowly. But we'll talk tomorrow with the team and the team doctor and see what's the best for me, and we'll do that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Nikola is one of the most popular names in Serbia. So yeah, maybe. There's a lot of Nikolas, for sure."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"He just told me, ""Welcome, teammate."" That means a lot for me because he accepted me. He stood up to shake my hand. It's really great to have him there. He's coming into the third year, and he's done a really good job the past two. And not just him, the players and the whole organization. I think we can do more."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"It was unbelievable. It was a dream come true. It's something that I've been dreaming of since I've been a little kid. Having my family with me at the table, my coach, my agent, having my family in the crowd, I couldn't ask for anything else. It was my mom's birthday today, so that's an awesome thing to celebrate as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,I'm at a loss for words. I'm super happy to be here and super thankful.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I never had a baseball team because there was no baseball team close to Kentucky, but I think I'm going to be an Astros fan now."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited. They have a really good thing going in Houston. The coach is really good. Like you said, Jalen. They have a bunch of really young, athletic guys, and we'll be able to play fast. It's going to be fun."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited to get out there and learn and take it all in, so I can't wait."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is just going in and learning. You have guys like Fred VanVleet that I'll be able to learn from. Just going in with an open mind, ready to learn, ready to do whatever it takes to win. Just compete and go in and have fun and continue to get in the gym and work on everything that I need to work on."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,Thank you.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,It just shows the amount of talent that we have in France. I'm really excited for Zacc. I think our national team is really going to be good.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,I was really happy for him. I kind of had a feeling. I was really happy for him.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Yeah, it helped a lot. My dad, he always loved basketball and he looked at basketball -- he never was happy after one of my games. He always had something to say for me to improve on it. I think that's what made me and my brother good players. I can't thank them enough for this."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"I mean, I think it's just a first step, but it's definitely achieving something that was big for me. You know, being drafted, I don't take it for granted and I'm sure enjoying it a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"Yes, we want the best version possible. I would say it's natural. We are like that. We work hard. We have a lot of energy. We want to be the best. For sure, we are going to continue to be like that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I think the basketball in France has improved, and that's why we are here in this draft. Three French players in the top 10, it's not nothing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I know Zaccharie because I've played against him since I was 15. He played against me when I was at Cholet and him at ASVEL. Alex, I don't really know him."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I'm going to share a lot of moments with my family, with my friends, and after, we will see. I don't really know what I'm going to do."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I know a lot of French players have played with this team in Charlotte. I'm the next one. I will bring all my fire to the club and be ready to play with some players, like you say, LaMelo Ball. Some alley-oops, yeah. I'm ready to jump and put the ball in the rim."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I had a workout a couple weeks ago. I really enjoyed the time that I spent with them trying to understand their philosophy. As soon as we were talking, kind of understand more about the organization."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Just start to present myself and told them what I was ready to do for them. I was saying that I wanted to contribute to -- I want to be a part of a winning team and contribute to winning and compete. For that, I say that I was ready to do whatever it takes to do it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Basically my versatility could be -- defensively in this league is really important. Trying to guard multiple positions, trying to be aggressive. I will know more soon, but now that's what I've got to say right now."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"That's amazing. We are trying to represent our country, and I'm so glad to be a part of it. There is more players coming in. I'm really proud of being a part of the success of my country. Trying to understand what Victor, Rudy or other French players really help me to develop myself as a player, first of all, in France, and hopefully now in the NBA."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,I'm not shocked. I'm not shocked. I've known Tidjane and Alex for a long time. We grew up playing against each other. So I know them really well.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Like I said, that's amazing for our country. That's amazing for us, first of all. Just to be able to realize our dream together is special. I feel like French players are going to take some inspiration, and that's going to be better and better for us. I really feel lucky because there's so many young players that are good. That's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I'm a versatile player. I feel like I can fit easily into this team. I can't wait to figure out what is going to be my role or my goals, or, you know, just to make sure we win games."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"So I don't know yet, but I know that I can do a lot of things. Defend multiple positions, grabbing some rebounds, finishing strong, being aggressive, shooting threes obviously. I think that's going to be -- that's a part of my game. That's something that I need to keep it up for helping the team to win the next season, because I know that we are going to have to shoot the ball. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"For now, I just want -- I just know the facilities of the Hawks. I can't wait to get in there and to just work in those conditions. I think that's a style of life that I'm not used to. I talk about the gym, the cold baths, locker room, whatever. I feel like if I could basically sleep in the gym. In Bourg-en-Bresse, which is a great gym, too, but not as good as the Hawks have. I can really sleep in the gym."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"The workout went well. It was probably one of my favorite ones, actually. I just really liked the coaching staff and the organization in general. I had an opportunity to spend time with them, and just being able to talk with them and interact with them. They just talked about the plan and what they are thinking about next year, and then what they are looking for in a big."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"And then obviously the workout, they gave me some advice on how to get better. I just love the organization, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"I haven't been playing basketball that long. I'm still learning each and every day, every time I step on the court."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"Obviously, I wasn't ranked and it wasn't something I was paying attention to. To be honest, I was trying to have fun on the court. Obviously, brought me from Cameroon all the way to here. You never know where the basketball can take you. Just being here is amazing. It's a blessing and I have to thank God to be able to put me in this position."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"Oh, for sure. According to everyone, they have the best food in the U.S. I remember going on my visit, I really liked it. I can't wait to get to know them a little bit more and just spend time with them on the team and just get to work, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Not really. I feel like my game is dissected very much so, whether it's being non-athletic, non-defender. So it's something I take as a challenge. I'm used to it by now, going to the biggest platform at Duke. You get used to it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,I'm just excited to embrace the challenge and embrace the process and have fun with it. It's a blessing to even be here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm just excited to learn from him, learn from both Maxey and him. Obviously they are elite scorers, so I think I can space the floor and create space for them. I'm excited to get to know them and learn as much as possible from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm excited. Obviously Maxey, I've heard great things about him. Watching him on the court, he's an elite player. Being able to play alongside him and learn from him. On draft night, there's surprises everywhere. So I didn't know where I was going. I tried not to get attached to any teams. So yeah, I guess it is a surprise, but I'm happy to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Not yet. I sent Maxey my number, and I got to talk to the GM, the coach. Not too much. But I'm excited to get to know them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I think it's my natural emotion, is just to be happy, be joyful. So there's no reason to change that when I'm on the court. I'm always going to embrace the challenge, obviously, but I'm going to have fun with it. Whether I make a three, make a good play, the team is excited, the crowd is excited. I'm going to be smiling probably no matter what. So it's something I bring everywhere I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I'd say my why is I feel like I've been underrated my whole entire life ever since I was coming out of high school. I've always had a chip on my shoulder, and to this day I'll always have that chip on my shoulder to go out there and prove people wrong."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, I would say to all the kids out there that don't have offers, you don't have to be the highest-rated kid in your class or whatever. You could always go junior college or whatever type of route and be different. You can make your own path and find your way."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"It feels great, to play with one of the greats to ever touch a basketball. It's going to be exciting to go put on a show for L.A."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, like you said, AD is there. I get to learn from one of the greatest in LeBron and AD to help me each step of the way on both sides of the floor. I'm excited just to go out there and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Learning how to take care of my body constantly. I would say that's the biggest thing I was focusing on, and just kind of being around those type of NBA guys that have been there and done that. So just kind of learning from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I would say it's a mixture. I was just trying to be the best version of myself, and try to always push myself to be better and be better than yesterday."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, I remember that clip. I woke up and rolled out of bed and I thought it was fake because tons of people were texting me. I was just like, there's no way."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, that's really exciting. At Tennessee, I watched a lot of JJ Redick with Coach Barnes. Just the way he moves and paces himself, and was able to create space. So hearing that, it's going to be really exciting and really special."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I would just say playing with a chip on my shoulder. Every single time I touch a basketball or walk into a gym, I always feel like I've got something to prove."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"It doesn't matter where I'm at. It's always going to be there, having that chip on my shoulder, feeling like I've been underrated for my whole life. It's something I'm going to carry with me the rest of my career."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"A hundred percent. I feel like there's no feeling like it. Just having all the people that have been a part of your journey since the beginning and seeing you grow. I feel like there's nothing like having them here with me and experiencing this with me and supporting me. There's no feeling like it, honestly."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"No, a hundred percent. I'm super proud of myself just sticking through that Australian season, knowing things were not going my way but continue to believe in myself every single day, and keep taking steps and getting better and looking at the bigger picture of my career. I feel like it's a great experience of being out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like Milwaukee was one of my best workouts I had. Even in the interviews at the combine and stuff like that, the interviews went really well. They just seemed like they had my best interests and they really liked me. So yeah, I kind of felt a little bit like Milwaukee would be the team that would want me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I would say that you just got to sometimes really just pop out and just show people, for real. You've just got to not want to duck or be scared. Believe in yourself more than anything and show people all the hard work that you've been putting in and the vision that you see and just put it out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like him coming in the tenth game of the season for us as a team and giving us a lot of freedom and a lot of trust, I feel like it really helped our team as a whole just play better in general with the players we had. He was a big part of our team's success, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,There's no feeling like it. It's surreal to me. Trying to soak it in. But it's truly a blessing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"Like I said before, it's just really truly a blessing to have players that you're really close with that are at the level that you want to be at and are doing the things that you want to do on the court. Just to have them to pick their brains and receive advice that they are giving me, I feel like it's truly a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Yeah, it's all in the process there. The coaches there, the people are just amazing. Dayton does a great job of giving you the right pathway. It's all up to you if you choose to believe in that or not."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"So they did that with me, Toumani Camara, Obi Toppin and all the guys before that. I decided to choose and I believe in it, and I'm here where I am now because of that. Very grateful for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"It was pretty cool. Great to see those players and a lot of great talent in there. I'm just happy to be where I'm at. Perfect fit. I'm very excited. I was excited the whole time. A little nervous. Great to see all my boys there watching me, but it's just great to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Great fit. I saw something that I get free nuggets from Wendy's. That's pretty cool. Other than that, I'm excited to get out there and play. It's a great team and a great organization for a reason. I'm going to get better and keep going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Probably an inhaler because I heard that -- what's it called, the altitude? I'm playing. I'll be all right."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Honestly, I don't know. I'm just going to embrace it all and just be ready for it. I'm excited."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"It means a lot coming from that program. Knowing that program just got shut down and I was the last bunch of that. Definitely taught me a lot on and off the court, really a lot of the things about life and being mentally healthy and just learning how the NBA operates."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"On the court, this might be surprising to say, but all the losing that we did, I definitely learned a lot more than if we would have won a lot. I think that definitely prepared me a lot for the NBA because you're going to go through a lot of things with the NBA. It's going to be a lot of things that you need to be able to talk about or just have an outlet to and just being able to figure things out quickly just to move on to the next."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I'm looking forward to changing things around. I know they have a stigma on them when it comes to a lot of losing, and I feel like I'm a huge part to be able to start to change that around. I have a willingness to win and I feel like me going into this franchise, being able to help them out with this good group of guys, good group of young guys that they have, I'm definitely super excited to get down there and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I appreciate all the love and support you've given me throughout the whole season, and I'm finally here and I wouldn't be here without y'all."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Like I said, I really appreciate all the love and support and all the competitive people in the G League. I appreciate y'all.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"What excites me is really the basketball portion of it, for sure. I heard you have a huge fan base when it comes to basketball, so that's definitely something I'm looking forward to getting into. I'm a huge community guy, so I definitely see myself getting into that community as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I would say just talk to everybody that has been with me throughout this whole process and really sit down and tell them how thankful I am for that. I've been through so much. Just being able to be here, blessed with this opportunity God has put me in. I'm super thankful for everyone who has been part of my journey."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Once I tell them that, everything will be said and done and I'll be on my way to Detroit, and get settled in and have a good one."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KYSHAWN GEORGE,"I mean, great. I think I can bring a lot to this team with my versatility, my size, my length, my IQ and my shooting ability. I think I will fit in very well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KYSHAWN GEORGE,"They are expecting hard work. Obviously, I can provide that. Just overall, like I said before, my versatility, shooting ability, spacing the floor and how smart I am with the ball."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"Everything that I thought of came to life. Flashbacks from when I was young. Just dreaming of being in this position, walking across that stage in my mind. Hearing my name be called and walk across the stage today, it all came true. It was just God gave me this to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"It helped me a lot. That program at Lu High was probably the best decision I made, to go for my two years' program. I'm forever grateful to Coach John Buck and Coach Josh Corbin to give me an opportunity to play there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,Their practices are like college practices. So I was prepared to go into that. Just having the competitive mindset helped me a lot.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"I think it was Coach Bennett. I wasn't really known as a good defender coming out of high school. Once I got to UVA and had my growth spurt, I think I got some God-given talents. Coach Bennett drilled that mindset in me, and I was able to take off at Virginia."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"I'm excited. I'm excited. Great program. They want to win a championship and they have got great players to do it. I'm going to try to get down there, go to work and see what I've got to do to get there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"Yeah, I think I can. It's just getting a lot of reps in practice and everything like that. Just getting the confidence and just let it go. That's what I'm going to try to do in Phoenix, is be in the gym a lot. Just do what I've got to do as a team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,I am. Born and raised.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"It's crazy because he lives in Arizona as well. We are both going to be in the same state again living together. It's going to be good. Being from New York representing not only as two athletes but as brothers in different sports, it's amazing and I'm grateful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,He's actually in Arizona. That's where he's staying. He's rehabbing on that.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"He's not with a team, but he's going to start throwing for a team soon."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's just a blessing, for real, to even be here because you work your whole life and you never know if you're going to make it. So when you finally get there, it's just a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"Yeah, playing with Anthony Edwards and the whole Timberwolves. They were in the Western Conference Finals. So it's really just a blessing because I get to learn from a lot of players and veterans and players that are real good. Them helping me is just a plus for me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I didn't really get to work out with them, but I used to see Ant at Overtime Elite a lot, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's a blessing to even be here in this situation. I thank the Timberwolves, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I would say the open space on the floor. There's so much open floor, and I feel like I'm quick so I can get past dudes. It's really the fact of me getting past dudes and making decisions. You're playing with a bunch of NBA players, so players can't really help off super a lot because these are NBA players and they knock down shots."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like, for me, getting past my defender and making plays for my teammates will be way easier, and then if they don't help, then it's just a bucket."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like it would be easier. Once I know the assignment and what my coach wants me to do, it's not really me adjusting. It's just me doing what he says. I feel like anything Coach tells me to do, I can adjust to and I can make it happen. So I feel like it's a good feel, for real."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"Me seeing Reed, my roommate, he's a great dude. He always pushed me and he always helped me. Me seeing him and we going together, it's just crazy to even see, and I'm thankful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Honestly, the workout went pretty well. I knew they were interested, but until the last minute, I didn't know where I was going. I'm very excited to start working. I can't wait."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,No. I'm planning on playing here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Obviously, I talked to the people over there. I got to learn more about the team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I was in the facility, everything. They showed me around. It was nice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think it's beautiful. I took a lot of risk. I left France when I was 17. So I did the last two years in Germany. I felt like it was a risk, and I believed in myself. I worked a lot and stayed confident."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Yeah, it's kind of crazy. I played with everybody. It's nice seeing your country being one of the most represented in the NBA. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of everybody. The French people that went to the NBA, it's big. It's coming from a different continent. We have to really work to get there. Yeah, I'm really proud of everybody."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"First, I would definitely say my brother, six years older. He was already playing basketball. But my first favorite player was probably KD."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think I'm really versatile, but I can also bring what a rookie needs to bring in a team. Bring some energy. Being able to grab a rebound, push the ball but also knock down shots. I think it's very important for a rookie to bring these things."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I don't know anybody personally on the team. But I talked with the coach, yeah."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"And yeah, it was nice to see him. I'm used to seeing him on TV. It was a little different, but I enjoyed it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I feel like I fit in great. I'm going to make sure that I get myself adjusted to whatever the team needs, whatever the players on that team need for us to be successful. With my high IQ and my versatility, I feel like there's a lot of different spots that I can fill and a lot of different needs I can address."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Basketball IQ, for sure. Making the right reads. Making smart plays. Being in the right position. I feel like that's very underrated, being in the right position and reading your defender. That's a lot of my game where I get my advantages from."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I'm going to continue it do that, and I feel like that's going to help everybody else on the floor as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Right, to the efficiency point. I feel like that's huge for me, just because I like to play the right way. I feel like me playing the right way is me getting good shots, whether that's open shots or good layups at the rim. I feel like I'm just reading the game and adjusting to whatever the defense does. When I get a good look, it's more prone to go in than not."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"And then to your other point, hopefully we'll make it three. That would be really historic. Yeah, Colorado is not looked at as a draft pick-producing university like these other programs are. But if you look at the history, there's a lot of really, really solid players that have stuck around a long time in the league. It's just a testament to what Coach Boyle and his coaching staff have done at Colorado."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,I'm excited to get to know them even more. We've got mutual friends. I've met them for the first time this past summer when my brother was playing on the national team and I went up there to Berlin to watch one of the games.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"But great people. They know my brother more than they know me, but they have already reached out to me through mutual friends. They make it very comforting to come to Orlando."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I talked with him earlier today, or tonight. I'm super excited, just learning from one of the great coaches. I feel like there's a lot that I can expand my game in, and I can't wait to learn even more. I feel like talking basketball and talking basketball IQ is one of my passions, as well, in the game. I'm just super excited to soak up all that knowledge and kind of grow."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"It's a blessing being here in the NBA Draft. One of many guys, and I'm just blessed to be in this space."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"I'm looking forward to playing with everybody, to be honest. I've heard a lot of great things about Utah. I'm just looking forward to learning a lot about it and living there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,I've never been to Utah. I don't think so.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"They are about to get a dog. I'm just looking forward to going in there and competing from day one, showing what I can do and just prove myself in the league in general."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, I mean, I'm really proud of Steph, happy for Steph. As a freshman, for him to come in and do what he did, help lead that team to another national title, is something very hard to do as a freshman. I love that kid to death. I'm extremely happy for him, and I'll be his biggest fan this year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it's been a crazy two years, from winning one national title to winning the Big East regular season to the Big East Tournament and then winning another national title. A lot of winning, a lot of succeeding the past two years. I feel like I'm going to keep that chip on my shoulder and go into Portland with just a lot of confidence, with a willingness to learn and get better every single day."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,I just want to have an impact and try to help this organization win and get to the top and try to win championships.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm really excited. I feel the connection with some of these young guys I've watched since I was in high school. Scoot Henderson, in particular. I feel like we have a chance to do something really special."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm young. Having a young team, just growing up around the same age, everyone learning and getting better every day, I'm really excited. I feel like I'm at a loss for words right now. I don't even know what else to say. I'm just excited and extremely blessed for this opportunity, and I'm really ready to get to Portland and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Being able to space the floor, knock down the three ball, playmake at a high level. I feel like I can handle the ball at the top of the key, pass the ball at a high level and I can shoot the ball at a high level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,One thing about me is I want to be a great teammate. I want to be the best teammate. I want to be the best player that Coach wants to coach every day. Coach is happy about coaching him because he gives his all. I want to be that guy. I'm just ready to get to work.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,It's a great feeling. You dream of this moment your whole life. You watch it on TV every single year. To have that moment here in front of you today and to hear my name called is something that I'll remember for the rest of my life.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"That was a really special moment. Like I said, I'm extremely blessed and grateful for everyone that has helped me to get to this point. I'm ready to get to work and ready to learn and ready to try to impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yes, I just did."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"It was great. I like Coach a lot. When I went out there for my visit, he was a good dude, great dude. The whole staff, the whole organization, you can really tell people that want to learn and want to win and learn and get better. That's something -- that's what I'm about, and I'm really ready to go get going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,Too young.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it just shows that we were the best program in college basketball and they still are right now. Coach Hurley is the best coach in college basketball, and he's producing players at a high level every single year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm not sure the exact number of draft picks he's had these past five years, but Coach Hurley has been the top of the top in college for a couple years now. I love that man to death."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,No. Just spend some time with some family. Soak everything in. Realize my life is going to change forever.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"They always told me that they were super high on me. But of course it's the NBA Draft, so you can't make any promises to anybody."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just can't wait to get out there and show my versatility, especially with the kind of talent that we already have on that team. It being the youngest team in the league right now, I feel like our future is pretty bright. I just can't wait to get out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"It's really hard to prepare for that moment. I mean, it's just a lot of emotions running through your head, especially when you hear your name being called."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"But on the basketball side of things, just always keep your head down, always working. Just staying humble and just having all that self-confidence in myself that everything is going to work out."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,I was just playing for the best coach in college basketball and now flipping to the NBA and going to play for a legendary coach like Coach Pop. It's a blessing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"On the culture side of things, it's not really a big culture change from UConn to San Antonio. Just being out there in the pre-draft process, you can tell it's a hardworking program and super hard-nosed. I just can't wait to go out there and just show what I got."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Everything is just happening like really, really fast. Just being in the natty, soaking in that moment with my teammates, that's a super big accomplishment. And flip over to a couple months later and you another one of your teammates are top-10 picks. It really means the world to me and I wouldn't trade this for anything."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just talked to him on the phone not too long ago. We were just talking about coming down to San Antonio and just can't wait to get to work, and just excited for our future and excited for this upcoming season."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"It means a lot. Me and D.C. have been through so much together. I was friends with him before I got to UConn, before I committed to UConn. I've known him forever now. I mean, I know how much he's been through."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"For that to happen, it's such a great reflection on our program and just it's a reflection on all the hard work that we've put in. It's really a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Nah, he didn't tell me that as soon as I got drafted. That's probably a conversations we'll have a little later."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,It's all good.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,That's a castle for my last name. This is a castle.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,And that's my initials right on the bottom.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,The last thing I'll do in probably just celebrate with my family. I was born here in New York. So I have a lot of family here at the draft. Just doing whatever I can to show how much appreciation I have toward them for all their support right before I go out to San Antonio and start my next journey.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Well, I mean, what I picked for the draft, it wasn't intentional. But I guess it all really worked out. I guess I kind of manifested it to happen for me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Oh, man, just want to thank God first, first and foremost, just for putting me in this position. I was ready to get ready to work. Coming in day one, do all the dirty work we need to do to win. I think I'm a winning player. I'm a win-now type of player, being one of the older guys in the draft. Just having that experience from college, and like I said, just doing all the dirty work, rebounding, diving on the floor for loose balls and just anything we need to do to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"I would love to play alongside Malik Monk, De'Aaron Fox, I think we have a great big in Sabonis, probably one of best passers in the NBA from a big standpoint."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"I'm just ready to be a two-way, versatile player. Get stops on one end, and I can also create some offense not only for myself but my teammates on the other end."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Me and Coach Brown talked, how we see myself fitting in on the team, and just coachplayer talk. I think I got a good feel for Coach and he got a good feel for me. Just ready to start in journey."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"It means everything. Just seeing his face whenever I got drafted, how happy he was, he didn't get a chance to get drafted. So just seeing his face and how excited he was for everything that we've been through, working out, countless hours throughout the night, morning. It's just a very special moment. Came up with handshake today and almost messed it up, but it's all right. We got it done."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, just me being confident, like I said, I know the type of player I am. I know what I bring to the court. I know I just wanted to give Kim the same promise he gave me when he first came to Providence, that he'll make me one of the better players in the conference. Just want to give him the same promise I got a seat for you at the green room table."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Just a mature, win-now, do-it-all type of player. Like I said, rebounding, dive on the floor, take charges, anything that is needed to do to win. Just very excited to play with some great players, and hopefully we can win a championship."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"I'm feeling about as good as you think I'd be feeling. It's a special feeling to finally be here and have my name called, and especially being so close to home. You know, that means a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"It means a lot. Definitely because I would say when I was younger, I wasn't really like that in my area, and to now be sort of that guy that people want to see, especially being from the area and now back in the area. It means a lot to finally see all the stuff that I've done come to light."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,I haven't even touched my phone yet.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"Definitely. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he has texted me already."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"Probably say he'll be at the first game, and ""Don't suck."" Something he would probably say to me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"For sure, yeah, he ain't got no choice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"I would say the biggest adjustment would be how they game plan. It's real strategic for the league. I'm starting to see that working out for all these different teams. They have a real game plan and strategy going into every single game, and if you don't execute it, you can't play. I feel like that's something I'm going to have to get adjusted to."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,Feeling good. Super blessed. I'm ready to work. I'm going to give the Bulls organization everything I've got.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"Super excited, man. I mean, this is a dream come true. I've been thinking about this since a young age. It means the world to me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"I'll dress well, but I'm worried about basketball. I'm not really worried about that. I want to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"Chicago is a winning program and I want to win. So being there, I can embrace it. I fit many different ways on the team. I feel like I can do everything on the court. Whatever Coach asks me to do, I'm going to do to the best of my abilities and I'm going to work hard."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,See my family. That's it.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"The program did an amazing job, even when they had the shutdown. Look at all the picks that they had. Everyone is good. All the coaches are amazing. They did a great job with everyone that they produced. I can't thank them enough, honestly. I would do it ten times over again."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"How do I feel it improved my game? Being around NBA coaches, veterans, just being in the NBA atmosphere, playing NBA rules and all that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Dove for the ball. Lively landed on me. I knew right away. I've chipped it in the past, so it's not new. But, like, I mean, this tooth is loose. The other two teeth are wiggling. They were trying stuff in the locker room. I was like, I don't care. Just play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"This is unreal. I don't think it really has hit and settled in. This is a special group of guys, a special coaching staff that I'm just thankful to be a part of. Yeah, it's unreal. I'm just trying to enjoy the moment and not get too lit laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"At the moment I got traded, I was -- I wouldn't say disappointed. But you're in San Antonio. That's all I knew."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Such a blessing to be a part of this roster. They just drive me in so many different ways, from top to bottom. I'm just so thankful and grateful for each and every one of them. They made me a better player and made me a better person. The city of Boston, everything, has just been amazing for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Man, I love Joe Mazzulla so much. Coming off the year I had, and he gets the job, and he's like, You know what? I'm going to start you. Which I wasn't expecting. He was like, I believe in you and I trust in you. This is going to give you the confidence."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"And from that moment on, I think it's changed my whole career. I'd do anything for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a great teammate, a great competitor. I was happy for him that he was able to go out there. The crowd cheering him on like that just got him going. He's still 7-4 and can do so many different things here. He's special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a surreal feeling. Still has not really kicked in yet. Just trying, I guess, to enjoy the moment. I kept saying, ""Wow."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"These last seven years have been a roller coaster, up and down. I had to listen to all the s--- that people said about me, and tonight, it was worth it. Oh, my God."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, maybe getting drafted. That's something that you dream about. But this is at the top of the mountain. To be able to say we did it, that we came together and we won a championship. Banner No. 18 has been hanging over our head for so many years. To know that we're going to be engraved in history, and it still hasn't like registered. I'm just still trying to process it all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,But we did it. We won a championship.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"He told me that I was the best in the world. I said, ""You're damn right I am."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,Say that again.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,Please say that again laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"That it was -- it was -- all the sacrifice was worth it. I'm so thankful to have been in the positions that I was growing up. Thankful for my mom. Thankful for my dad introducing me to basketball. My grandmother who helped raise me. All my friends and family that have supported me, every coach, every teammate that I've had."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, this is going to be a night that I will remember for the rest of my life, from the game, the celebration, these moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, over the last couple years, we had some tough losses at home in the playoffs. We've lost the NBA Championship at home in front of our fans. We had a chance to beat Miami in Game 6 a few years ago and lost that one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So to have a big win, the biggest win that you could have in front of your home crowd, I felt like that was really important to go out there and do everything in my power to make sure we won this game tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"It took being relentless. It took being on the other side of this and losing in the Finals and being at literally the lowest point in a basketball career that you could be, to next year, to the following year, thinking that was going to be the time, and come up short again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So, I mean, people have said it before. But coming up short and having failures makes this moment that much better. Because you know what it feels like to lose. You know what it feels like to be on the other side of this and be in the locker room and hearing the other team celebrating, hearing them celebrate on your home floor. That was devastating."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"And now, to elevate yourself in a space that, you know, all your favorite players are in, everybody that they consider greats or legends have won a championship, and all of the guys I looked up to won a championship, multiple championships."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So now I can, like, walk in those rooms and be a part of that. It's a hell of a feeling. This is more -- I dreamed about what it would be like, but this is 10 times better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"First of all, congrats to him. Well-deserved. Extremely happy for him. This is a hell of an accomplishment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, they complement each other very well. They are both three-level scorers. They can both use the pick-and-roll. One setting it, one coming off of it, vice versa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me. But to my teammates and the fans there, they're getting a big-time player and even better person. Just somebody who is going to bring it every day, push the people around me. Just someone that is going to work hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really proud of what our owners -- this is something, the owners actually appoint and pay the coaches, that our owners have stepped up to do. I think it's something we have our eye on, we had our eye on as soon as I came into the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sport is something that always in Serbia was something that put in front of us everybody, even like 10, 20 years ago, whatever, but now when we have Djokovic who won, probably the best ever. For us he's the best ever of course, and now we have our NBA championship, and I think it's a really good moment to be a Serbian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,It's like four or five.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day. Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career. I'm not worried about this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think as a group, I think we've found ways that we've gotten great looks. I think we've found a little bit of a rhythm offensively. We haven't made all the shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,Also just taking our time and trying to get this win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the moment, it's us, our coaching staff, our players. But this was for all Nuggets. That was what was really cool about it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I wouldn't say that it was a lineup change. I get what you're saying. We just went back to our original lineup. We went with this lineup for 14 games. I didn't have the foresight, I didn't. That's on me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I've heard that. Yeah, I don't know. Just my father's last name, as well. I don't know. I guess I've got like H's in my family or something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just an amazing duo. They've been together for the longest, and just how comfortable they are with each other and how they know each other's tendencies and what works for them and us as a team. It was just truly amazing to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"That's three 6'9"", 6'10"", 6'11"" guys who can dribble, pass and shoot, have high II think that's going to be a huge advantage for us and a struggle for other teams to game plan for."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"Yeah, super, super looking forward to it. Super excited about, just playing in the league in general. Just super excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, we have player personnel sheets and booklets essentially that we can go through and study players' tendencies, what their strengths are, what they like to get to, how they're most effective. Then I just kind of go through that, treat it like a Bible for the next couple of days and just stick to the script."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"For sure. It's something I take pride in, the defensive end. Having that opportunity, having that role, is something I'm really looking forward to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I think it's a standard that we hold ourselves to and that we have held ourselves to all year long. We've been building habits day in and day out. So, you get to a game like this, the biggest stage in basketball, you let your standard of play and you let your habits carry you."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I had a feeling from the information I was being told is that it was just kind of up in the air. Orlando wasn't really sure yet, and just to be ready for whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, to be honest, it's something that -- since year one, whoever was kind of speaking my language or I'm trying to kind of stay in touch or whatever, some guys maybe a little bit more, some guys a little bit less, but I'm trying to stay in touch with everybody."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, I think I knew the Fever were interested, but you never know until draft night obviously happens. I wasn't getting my hopes up or anything like that. Was just keeping an open mind."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We decided that given that investigation was ongoing and it remains ongoing, that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to work in these Finals. I don't know what the ultimate conclusion will be. We'll see where the facts take us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, I think that's -- Nikola never tries to impose his will or force things that aren't there. He's going to read the game. He's going to make the right play. Most importantly he's going to make every one of his teammates better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I think defensively he is definitely one of the best defenders out there. I credit that to his IQ but also his activeness with his hands.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think it's an opportunity to learn. You watch the film, go to school on it, try to take away some things that you did well, and then certainly learn from some things that you can do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, it seems like they've prioritized that, just maybe helping a little bit less on drives and staying home a little bit more. So it's an adjustment. It's something that we're used to and we feel like we can still generate good three-point looks. It's just going to be a matter of running good, crisp offense with pace, full court and half court, and then just playing to our strengths."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I really haven't thought about free agency at all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, there's lots of moments, kind of when there's a pause in the action, I guess, if you will, to kind of step back and be appreciative of the journey. When you're in it throughout the day to day, you're just focused on what's next. Obviously your perspective shifts and changes as you advance in your career and you want more for yourself, because we're all competitive people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Sometimes a dream is deferred, and our dream was deferred for a few years, but we stuck with it, and we added the right pieces. Huge shoutout to Calvin Booth and the job he's done. This is just an unbelievable feeling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,P-Wat has a great feel for the game and a chance to be a really great player for this team and to help this team along the way. I'm excited for P-Wat and the experience that he has gathered thus far.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Just enjoying and embracing this moment, I think that was the biggest lesson. I feel like I truly embraced it. I was very excited just to see my name pop up. It didn't matter if it was first round, second round. I'm just excited to be here. I know they're going to be always around me. I'm always going to be part of the Huskies family. I can always go talk to coaches, call them whenever, even the alums. It's just a big family. So it's nice to have them as my support group that I can always go to and ask questions about the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, when you play a team numerous times in a row, you've got to know what's coming. They know what we're doing, we know what they're doing. We're going to keep adjusting, mixing things up, but everybody is -- he's locked in. KCP is -- it's a defensive game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Not too much. The main focus through this pre-draft process was everything on the court. That's what it's always going to be for me, just keeping the main thing the main thing. But obviously there's stuff to talk about off the court. So later on the road, obviously. But as of now, I'm excited to get out there tomorrow. I can't really put into words how I'm really feeling about it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Tim Connelly hired me and brought me to the table here, and my countless conversations in my seven years with Tim, we would always talk about how we had the luxury of working for a group with Stan and Josh and the Kroenke family that is not going to be just a quick trigger. We have to make a move. We have to make a move. They were willing to take a step back and see this thing through."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and all of our head and assistant coaches, I'd like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, John Hareas, Mike Levine, Mark Broussard and so many people at the NBA, and for all the league support and assistance in providing this tremendous platform for our great coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Everything, man. We were there I think for five days. We saw Christ the Redeemer, we went to different beaches, different places to eat, as well as seeing all the basketball fans over there and how the game has grown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"So really excited to be drafted, excited to get to Dallas and get into training camp."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Las Vegas tell us that we were underdog before. That doesn't... It's not correct, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,The day I walked through the doors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Nah. I had one of my high school teammates who played for the Heat at the time, so I saw him a lot. But other than that, no."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with. So I'm fortunate enough to be able to be the one right now that's in the limelight, to be able to represent our area the best I can, and I look forward to being able to represent Miami, as well, and trying to get this title."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well."
