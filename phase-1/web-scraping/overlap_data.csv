2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying laughter."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited to get out there and learn and take it all in, so I can't wait."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"'26 is definitely our goal for certainly the next one, and then shortly thereafter, if not then, or a year or two after. So by '28, I'd say I'd feel pretty confident we'll be at 16 teams."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"All-Star Weekend is special, and it's always more special when you get to share it with a teammate or two. I've been fortunate enough to share it with him three times now. It was great. It was great to have a teammate, familiar face around, especially we get to share the same locker room."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"For me, it's not any more difficult. I think I've learned through experience -- and obviously as a young kid it's easy to get caught up in it, just going back to high school and rankings and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"I loved it. The shorter introductions, not being on the stage and all that, I'm definitely a fan of that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No, I prepared her at halftime. I just felt, going with a bigger lineup, I said, okay, be ready, we may go for a big lineup. So Nyara, you're coming in."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's got to be MJ, I guess. I mean, he was the best."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"This is very humbling, very blessed, and it's something I will never forget obviously. It's part of my journey."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"Fortunately, I've been around a few times, so it wasn't my first time. But it's always a blessing, especially for the older guys. You've got Steph, LeBron, KD. Those three in particular, those are Hall of Famers, top-tier guys. It's always a blessing to share the court. As long as you can, you treasure those moments. Hopefully I'm talked about in the same category as my career continues to move forward."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,This is actually going to be my first time in Chicago. I'm really excited. I've heard really good things about it. You have some of the best pizzas. I'm excited to get there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Doing it in front of my family and them be able to come to New York, it just means a lot."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I hadn't been shooting the three ball well all night, but when I needed them to go in, they definitely did. God was good. I just was honored to be in the moment. I definitely tried to go the reverse through the legs. I couldn't make it in the All-Star Game, but I made it in a real game. Kind of funny how I did that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be patient. You've got to be patient. They're not always going to do things that you like. Be patient because they're kids. I think that's the most important thing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think it's beautiful. I took a lot of risk. I left France when I was 17. So I did the last two years in Germany. I felt like it was a risk, and I believed in myself. I worked a lot and stayed confident."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think just my teammates and how much time we spent together. I think that's something I'll miss, all the memories and things like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in."
