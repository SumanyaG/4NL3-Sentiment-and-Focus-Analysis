2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"Depending on the teams that you're playing, you know the teams that want to shoot 40, 50 threes a game. You know the teams that want to shoot 25 to 30. You just have to do your scouting and be prepared for it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I don't know, because when I came into the league, I didn't look at myself as the face of anything. I didn't look at myself as the next Michael or the successor to Michael."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"Being here. You still get that moment where I'm in the locker room looking at Steph, AD, KD, Kawhi, Joker, Luka all those guys. Those are just a few of the names. Those are the guys in the West. So you still have that feeling like, this is pretty cool."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I still at heart and like deep inside, I'm still like that 18-year-old kid that came into this league from Akron, Ohio, which is like you don't really have many inspirations. You've got to grab it from somebody, and it's usually like a family member or a basketball coach or a football coach or a teacher or somebody like that. It's not many people that make it on TV or make it to doing special things that you think is special."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"Yeah, I mean, I told myself before the season when I committed to being a part of the Olympic team, obviously it was all predicated on my health. As it stands right now, I am healthy enough to be on the team and perform at a level that I knew I could perform at."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"Like you said, there's still time left in the season, a third left in the regular season. Obviously, I don't know what the future holds as far as postseason, whatever the case may be. Like you said, it's 11 games, but it is 5 12 weeks, and it's more miles put on these tires."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I've always -- if I'm committed, which I am, to Team USA, then I'm going to commit my mind, body and soul to being out there for Team USA, being out there representing our country with the utmost respect and go out and play."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"But the one thing I know for sure, I don't have to carry the load. I've never had to carry the load on any one of the three teams I've been on, the '04 team, the '08 team and the '12 team. I just try to do my best and be as great as I can be on the floor in the minutes I'm out there."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I'm not sure right now what the full team is going to look like, but from some of the names, I know I don't have to feel any pressure going out there to feel like I have to carry the team. That's going to be a full 12-man roster that's capable of doing it both offensively and defensively on any given night versus any country in the world."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"First of all, it's expletive great to see you. It's so great to see you, Jeff Zillgitt. Love this. And the fact that you got the last question is even greater. You tried to hide in the back. I love that as well. Love you, man. Wow, it's great to see you."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"To your question, there's so much scoring in this league. You can't really put your hands on people too much. I think there's guys that have learned that ability to get to the free throw line very frequently out on the floor. You have guys shooting 20 -- I've seen guys shoot 15 to 20 threes in a game."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"We have some great scorers in this game, that when you see guys putting up 50s, 60s, 70s, it's like you're watching the game, you're like, oh, man, he either had a heater, he caught fire. You've seen guys this year scoring like 40 in the first half."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I don't know, you've got so many great talents in this league. Would I sit here and say I think guys can score 80 or 90? Yeah, why not? It's been done before. Talent is talent no matter what generation it is. '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s all the way until now, talent is talent, and great basketball and great scorers are going to be great scorers no matter what era they're in. Once a great scorer gets going, there's really nothing you can do."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I know you've asked this question before, and a lot of you guys have asked, what does it feel like to be in a zone? Once a guy's in a zone, there's nothing you can do. If a guy decides he wants to stay in the zone, or you've seen Caitlin the other night when she broke the record, there's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can do."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"If the game's flowing at a very good pace and you've got a heater from the midrange, you've got a heater from the free throw line, you're shooting threes, you shoot 15 threes, you make 10 of them, that's 30 right there. You go to the free throw line 15 times and make another 13, 14, that's 43 points right there. You could very easily make another 10, 12, 15 points from two-point land and just be at 60, 70, 80."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I think it's possible. I mean, we've seen Kobe. We've seen Kobe do it. Kobe -- obviously, I'm not going to put too many guys on Kobe's level, but when you have a hot streak, we've seen Kobe live put up 81. I think it could be done."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,Of course you get a bonus question. You don't have to ask that. Of course.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,I am. I promise you.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,I'm feeling okay. I definitely wasn't going to put too much pressure on the game tonight for me physically. I want to try to be as healthy as I can be physically. This last part of the season is very important for us. I got to make sure of that.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"It possibly could. It depends on the recovery process. So possibly, but we will see."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"Still just my love for the game. I'm not pursuing anything, but my love for the game runs deep. Just trying to give everything I can to the game until I have nothing left, in the sense of just my love."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"It's not about the physical or things of that nature. It's just about the pure joy of going out and playing a game that I love. I know I don't have much time left, but while I'm out there, just trying to play with a lot of joy and a lot of fun."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"I don't know. I think it's something we need to figure out. Where is the median? This is what a lot of the games are starting to look like too. We wanted to get more pace into the games. We wanted to get more shots. We wanted the game to be more free flowing. We stopped letting the game -- be freedom of movement, a lot of freedom of movement now. That's what our games are like in the regular season now."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"They let us tighten up in the postseason. It's a deeper dive into a conversation of how we can shore up this game. Obviously from a player's perspective, it's fun to get up and down. But at the end of the day, our competitive nature don't like to have free-flowing scoring like that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"But I think the good thing that came out of tonight was none of the players were injured, and everybody came out unscathed or how they were before the game started. So it's a deeper conversation."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"One, I don't know, man, it's super surreal and super crazy and just very humbled and blessed that I can be able to still perform on the stage at this point in my career and be able to do some of the things that I did 20 years ago. I think that's pretty cool."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"I always acknowledge the greats. I understand the greats that came before me and the people that laid down the foundation for this sport to be as great as it is today. I happen to be a recipient of that. Because of Big O and so many other great players, obviously, if anybody know my history, they know how much I admire Big O, not only for what he contributed to the game, but also what he stood for off the floor as well."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"We've always had a really cool relationship, and every time I get an opportunity to see him, we just pick it back up where we left off. To see him tonight was a treat for me. I didn't expect to see him. I didn't know he was going to be here. So it was a treat for me to see him again."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"I've been asked about Victor before, and I just think he's going to continue to get better and better and better and better the more games he plays. He has one of the greatest coaches in basketball history in Coach Pop, and he's going to learn it the right way by just being around Pop. Pop is one of my favorite guys."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"The kid is special. He's going to continue to get better and better. If he's doing that at 19 now, just imagine what he's going to look like at 21, 22. So a special kid."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"It's awesome. I remember my first All-Star Game and looking up and seeing the likes of Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett and those guys, and I was just in awe. Just to see guys in their first All-Star Games, like you said, Paolo and the rest of the guys here, it's special. It's special for them."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"I think you saw the raw emotion that Jalen Brunson showed when they asked him after a Knick game how he felt being an All-Star. I think you saw the raw emotion, and that's how much he cares about being acknowledged and for him to be a first-time All-Star is just super cool."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"To be a part of their moment, because this is their moment, is something I can look back on and be like that was a cool moment."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"For me, what I find is a silver lining is looking at my upbringing and looking at kids that are in situations that I was in when I was younger, trying to be an inspiration to them, letting them understand that there is a way out. I was one of the kids that made it out."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"So it's my responsibility and my duty to let them know that no matter what you're going through, there is a path out. If you just commit to your dream and you can make that dream become a reality. I think that's what it's all about."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,I've shared a great relationship with the Philippines and TITAN and us having that -- we share some of the same core values. I always respected that even when I went over there and spent a lot of time in the Philippines in Manila.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"Sometimes that's all a kid has is hope, and that's okay. As long as you don't give that up. Don't ever give that up because it's always brighter on the other side, for sure."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I think there's a lot of energy in the building, a lot of energy from Pacers fans, a lot for us to be excited about."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,You saw what Ben started off with Rising Stars MVP. Won the Skills Challenge yesterday. There's been a lot of love and excitement through not only our city but our organization as well.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,We just want to carry that momentum through the second half of the season and make a playoff push.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Last time it was my birthday, I was in college, broke my wrist. Never thought I would be here. Knew that at that time that my wrist was broken. I knew I was going to go to the NBA, but never thought I'd have the success I'm having."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"As I reflect back, it's really special. I don't take this life for granted. Yeah, it's a dream come true for me."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I was just going to keep shooting until I missed. Having fun playing basketball. I didn't know how many minutes I was going to play, didn't know how my leg would feel. I felt good today, even after the one-leg dunk. So that's positive for me."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Obviously it wasn't high intensity at all. It feels good that I felt good, and hopefully I can continue that moving forward."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I think I've handled it pretty well, but just as professional athletes in general -- microphone interruption. My bad. I don't know what's going on up here."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"But to answer your question, I think as professional athletes, we're human beings at the end of the day. I think what you put off surface level is different than -- we're all humans and we all have emotions and good days and bad days."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I think the reason I've had success leading my franchise is the people around me and the trust that's put in me, it's a big responsibility for me, and I'm completely understanding of that. Yeah, just trying to do a good job with it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It was fun. I've said so many times you dream about it as a kid. When you get here, you think you're ready for it, but you're not."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It's a dream come true. Every kid dreams and sees, like, Bron on billboard in Cleveland, and you dream one day it can be you. To see it come to life, I can't describe it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, for sure. I think we're starting to kind of see others take notice of us. We knew that was going to happen once we started winning games. It comes with the territory."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, for sure, it's on the rise. So many talented young guys, guys my age, guys older than us. We have a good crop of talent in Canada. As we continue to get more exposure, keep working, we'll keep going up."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Absolutely. The country means the world to me. It gave me an opportunity. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. So fortunate to be from there. Kids all over the world just don't get the opportunity because of where they're born. I don't take that for granted."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"To kind of have the flag on my back, it's a special feeling."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I appreciate that, but Steve is still ahead of me. I'm going to try to catch him, but he's still ahead of me."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Whenever somebody says good things about you, it's a compliment. Obviously he was a heck of a basketball player, knows the game really well, and I appreciate it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,For sure. It's one of those things that I expected to happen as I got better as a basketball player and became more consistent. It comes with it. It's fun. It's stuff you dream about.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Not at all. Like I said, I've been dreaming about this, this moment, this point in my career. I know what comes with it. I embrace it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I think just the underdog mentality that the brand kind of has, that I have had my whole career. Our stories kind of align with that. Then just, I think we have the same vision for the future, Converse basketball, and the direction."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"The shot-making from the East was incredible. Hard to play defense when somebody is shooting 30-, 40-footers. Great display of shooting tonight. Like I said, record-setting points was pretty cool."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Good test for us. They're playing well lately, and they've got some new additions to their team, which is going to challenge us. It's a great game to start the second half of the season with."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Yeah. I feel like the league is always looking out for the fans and trying to keep their interest high. This All-Star Weekend has gone on for a long, long time, so to keep people engaged is tough to do."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,I think they're doing the best job that they can. People are always excited for All-Star Weekend. I think they do the best -- a great job of trying to keep everybody engaged all the time.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"It's just a testament to the hard work and the enthusiasm he has for the game of basketball. Obviously, multitalented at everything on the floor. But I think anybody in any walk of life could pick up on his love and care for the game of basketball, his teammates and just helping to push the game forward."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,I think everybody could take from that and learn. His story has been inspiring for the last 20 years.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Me and Kawhi was in awe of them shooting from the three-point line like it was a free throw. That's strength, power, muscle memory. That's someone who works extremely hard every day on their craft to be able to do that without flinching. It was just normal and natural motion."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Those are supreme athletes, and it's good we get to celebrate them on weekends like that. Pretty cool he gets to bring the All-Star MVP back to his hometown and back to his family."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"We don't talk about the strength of schedule. We respect every team regardless and try to focus on us as much as possible each night. It just about building our habits, getting better at what we've already established and pushing forward."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I think playing against some of the teams that's going to be there at the end of the season, it's going to be a great test before we head to the playoffs."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I think that's a balance you always try to figure out each and every game, maybe something different. I think, when he has the ball in his hands and he's controlling the game, Coach can ask him anything, for him to score or get his teammates involved. He's up and able to do anything coach asks him."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"His teammates love him. Fans love him. I'm excited to watch his career going forward because I know he's going to do some incredible things here in Indiana. But just for the game of basketball as a whole, you can tell he's one of those point guards that the next generation, kids in elementary school, middle school kids will be looking up to."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,It's cool he got his opportunity and got his franchise to kind of run on his own.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"It's always been that way with NBA, and since the social media era, you see more and more of that. I think guys in the past have stood up for what they believe in, social issues in the league, and that's given us the confidence to go out and do it as well in this generation."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,We're only doing what the greats have done before us. They set a great example when it comes to that. It's good we have such a huge platform to get a message out quick to anybody around the world.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I like East and West always. I like playing conference versus conference, the traditional way that I grew up on. Hopefully we go back to playing in our own jerseys too."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Traditional way, the way that the picking teams, all that stuff, it doesn't matter. It's all about the product on the court and celebrating the best players in the league at that moment."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,I just love my job. I love getting up and doing what I do every day. It's just in my DNA at this point to just get at that hoop.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I enjoy every part of it. There's stressful times, but I enjoy it too. Honestly, when I'm out of those stressful times, it's cool to look back and get better at both. I just love my job. I want to do it as long as I can."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,He's been doing it for his whole career. I know I got off to a head start. But you can stretch your imagination. I think Atlanta two years ago where I think he won -- like maybe two feet beyond the three-point line to win the game in that Elam ending thing. It's always fun to stretch the limits of where he could shoot. He's been doing it a long time.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,You don't ever want to lose that joy no matter how deep you get into your career and the expectations that come with the success that you have and the standards you set. Things are going to get tougher when you try to win at the highest level. Embracing that while still playing with joy is always the challenge.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"He's been to two All-Stars, and playoff experience and all that will come. The sky's the limit for him. You don't want to change who you are as you get deeper into your career."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"Extremely excited. 2019, I think it was, I got to go home to Charlotte and feel the love of my hometown. Kind of embraced that experience. I imagine it's going to be that plus a whole lot more. Hosted in the Bay, it will be the first time since 2000. So a lot to offer."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"The whole Bay has a lot to offer -- San Francisco, Chase Center, possibly some spotlights in Oakland and our history there and in that city as well. But I'm excited. Thankful to be a short drive."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"I think about it all the time, but the thought stops because you've got to get ready for the next game. There's a routine and a cycle that goes if you embrace it now. Eventually you'll get to the point where you'll wake up, and whatever your body's telling you, whatever your mind is telling you, it's time. But I don't think I'm anywhere close to that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"He had this phrase called ""tiki-taka"" he called it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"It's a great visual to see. It's a great comparison of body movement, ball movement, between the two sports. It's all about just flow and rhythm and chemistry. We've had a certain style that we've mastered that has evolved over the ten years he's been coaching. Yeah, it was a concerted effort to get us to play a certain way that would help us win. Obviously we've been able to do that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"I don't know. I'll be able to answer that question better when it's all said and done, because you're still passionate and inspired to win more championships. Individual accolades come from that mission, and that is my advice."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,I'll be able to answer that when I'm done. No idea right now.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it was great. Overall the weekend, celebrating basketball and the legends around the game and stuff like that, celebrities. I think it was a good weekend overall."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"I've only been to a few. The only one I really can compare it to was Utah, because in Atlanta, the other one I went to, was COVID or whatever the case may be. So far, so good for me. I thought that was a great crowd, great energy. Turned out well."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"Definitely the snow. I think nobody planned for that. But I live in Boston, so I'm used to it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"It was cool. It was fine. Before, I think we were attempting to put a little more effort into it, but I'm not sure how successful that was."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"Hopefully as the years go on, it gets back to being what the fans want to see. But I think maybe it was a little bit more effort this time, I think. I don't know. You guys would be a better judge of that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, there were some discussions. There were definitely some. I'm not sure how successful that was, but there were definitely some discussions. I guess guys are trying to figure out how to do that at the same time as having fun, being safe, being injury free. I guess more solutions need to be had to figure that out."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"It was cool being on the same team as J.T. this time. It was pretty cool. We got the win, and we had fun. I think it's just another platform to continue to raise for yourself but also raise for the city of Boston, just represent. I think that's what we kind of look at it as. That's what we've become."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,No practice. We just kind of went in hoping we'd have a better result. Obviously it went better in my head and our heads for sure than it looked out there.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"We still had fun. I put my name in the hat. It was a little bit uncomfortable to participate in that contest, out of my comfort zone, but I wouldn't change anything. I went out there, tried to compete. Tried to bring some attention to it. Didn't go the way I expected, but that's a part of it sometimes."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"I wouldn't say proud of myself, but I wouldn't change anything. I would do it again, if I felt like I made that decision. It was a little out of my comfort zone, but I did want to do something. I feel like I'm in my athletic prime. I felt like I wanted to go out and participate at some point in my career, and I did that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,I didn't get a chance to meet him. He came in and said some words to us as a group. He kind of like said hello to everybody. We didn't get a chance to really communicate or talk. But it was great. That was my first time ever seeing him up close and personal. I haven't seen him around Boston or anything. It was pretty cool to see him around.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"He stayed hot from Saturday night, the win that he had. You could tell he was going for it. All we had to do as a team was give him the ball, and he did what he does best Make a lot of threes. How many did he have? 10, 11? He totally deserved it. All he had to do was play hard and give it his everything."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's incredible. He was shooting a couple shots and they were going in, and he would see like the reaction of everybody, KD, Steph, KAT, Jokic, they were all looking like, and I'm like, dang, that's my teammate there. I'm happy that he's on my side, and I'm happy what he's capable of doing on the court."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"We've just got to stay healthy, keep enjoying the game. Keep on getting together, getting closer. Build good habits as a team in the last 26 games that we have, and hopefully when it matters most, we can gain some edge. He can make tough shots like that, and I can do the rest to try to help us win."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"To answer your question, it's nice to have him on our side."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I don't know if I felt it. Maybe I did feel it a couple times. I don't know that I felt I had to lift and put Milwaukee on the map. I was just playing hard, doing what I love, being consistent with it, staying humble through the whole journey. I always wanted to get better."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I think by doing that step by step, I was able to -- people around the world know where Milwaukee is, and people talk about Milwaukee. Me being able to win a championship, in the last couple of years, we've been always competing for the championship. Obviously it takes a lot of hard work, a lot of time. But at the end of the day, it wasn't like my mindset being in Milwaukee, I wasn't thinking small-market team, small city, I've got to put them on the map, I've got to raise the whole thing."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"No, I always was, I've got to get better. I've got to represent them the right way when I put on that jersey. I've got to respect the people and respect the people before me, and hopefully I can make my mark. By having that mindset, I think I've been able to do it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy that I can spend a few down days with my family, getting my mind right, getting my body right. Getting in the gym and working out and getting ready for the game."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I think as a team, we all needed that. The last couple games we played before the break, you could see not only were we tired physically, but we played two back-to-backs in a row, four games in five days or four games in six days, I don't remember, but it's tiring."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Our shootarounds, our practice, we have to get closer as a team. It's always like we've got to catch up. Usually when you start off in training camp, you have game plan, the structure and you keep adding slowly, slowly, slowly. We don't have that luxury anymore. Every shootaround, instead of shooting around and messing around and getting ready for the game, we actually practice. And so now we're physically a little more tired than the other team."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Now we're adding things. We're adding more things. So I feel personally and our team, we need this little break, five, seven days, hoping to get back refreshed and go win some games."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I have no idea. It's a funny and a crazy story at the same time. I really don't expect everybody to know who I am or know my name. I'm not aiming for that. I'm actually aiming for the opposite, kind of stay as low profile as I can. Yeah, crazy, crazy story."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Going through the streets of Lagos trying to buy a Giannis jersey. I told my mom, if I see my jersey, I'm going to stop and buy it. I don't care if people mob me. I've never bought my jersey before. It's a good way to do it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"You cannot hope guys miss. The players are too good. Guys are making shots from half-court. You saw that today. Last All-Star Game before that, I think in Cleveland, I think Steph was doing the same thing. Even guys that are not as good at three-point shooting, they can still shoot the ball. You can't just hope. You have to make it tougher, contest."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"My philosophy is kind of drive them off the three. I think that's what we've been doing the last couple of years. Try to make them shoot a tough two. No layups. Protect the paint. We have a great Defensive Player of the Year candidate, Brook Lopez, on our team. Send as many people as you can to the paint. No easy layups. Whenever a guy is at the three-point line wide open, you've got to fly out to him and make him put the ball on the floor. If he's going to take a dribble, dribble, dribble three, the chance of that going in is better."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"If you allow him and force him to take a tough two from the free throw line or a floater, it counts for two. I feel like that's been our philosophy the last couple years. That's our game plan. We still are going to allow a lot teams to shoot threes because they still play basketball. They play basketball. We play basketball. You cannot guard everything. But to be a good defensive you team, you have to make the other team shoot tough twos, and that's the way."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's fun. At the end of the day, we don't get as much time as we probably want to get with our family because of our profession. Our program is very, very busy, and whenever I can spend some time with my kids and kind of make them understand what I do, I try to take the time."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Mostly in the past I kind of kept my kids out of the spotlight, to allow them to choose this life for themselves and not this life choose them. Whenever they can understand and want to jump into the spotlight, great, but I wanted that to be their decision. But I feel like that kind of created a disconnect between me and my kids. Like when I was on the basketball court, I kind of stayed away."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"But now I'm like, this is who we are. This is my family. I want my kids to be great men and understand what I do. I want them to have fun and see that their dad is having fun also. They enjoy basketball, and now I cannot keep them away from basketball."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"So I'm excited. I'm excited to be a father. I'm excited to make a future with my kids, and I hope that I can be a good father."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I'll say many times if you could like create the perfect brother, Thanasis would probably be the person. He always like looked after us, took care of us, be supportive of us. He's always been there for not just me, but all our brothers."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Back in the day, my brother Thanasis went viral with the Shammgod move. He basically shared shoes with me. He shared the Kobe five, Kobe six, something like that. It was the same colorway that I wore today, white and red. I loved them. Whenever he played, he'd take them off and then give them to me and allowed me to play. So we used to share our shoes."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Then in 2019 in Charlotte, I got exactly those shoes, and I wrote on the shoes, ""Thanks, Thanasis, for sharing."" And I kind of paid tribute to him for sharing the shoes with me ten years ago. He never thought I was going to be an All-Star or the person that I am today. He was just with me because he loves me. I love him, too, so I wanted to pay respect for him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Absolutely. My foundation is based in St. Louis. Obviously that's where I'm from. I'm very prideful about the city and community I grew up in and trying to impact and change those around me.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, the initiative will start in St. Louis, and hopefully as it continues to grow and we get bigger and get more resources, I would love to expand. As of right now, it just focuses on single-parent families in St. Louis at the moment."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Individual awards are important. I'm not going to say that they're not. Everybody wants to win a championship, but you want to be rewarded for the work that you put in, for the things that you go out there and do on the court."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"They have individual awards for a reason. As a competitor, as a player, you grew up watching your favorite players winning MVP and First Team All-NBA and all that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Of course you want to win those things. But you can't take precedent over playing the right way and doing the things that you have to do in order for your team to essentially be the best team in the league and have a chance to win a championship.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Would I love to win? Yes. But apparently us losing the Finals two years ago affects what people think of me now, so I guess I've got some ground to make up. Everybody who has a vote, they vote -- the criteria is different. Everybody thinks differently. Right, wrong, or indifferent, it is what it is. You can't tell people what they should look for when they vote. That's the beauty of it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, it's been great. Couldn't be happier for him. You see the things that he did while he was at Duke. That's when I first got to know him and be able to talk to him. Obviously since he's been in the league, got a chance to meet his dad, his mom, signed with Jordan Brand, so obviously we have that connection as well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Just a great person, great kid, works extremely hard. Obviously only in the second year, and already an All-Star. So the work is there. The talent is there, for sure. I'm excited to see where he takes it. Couldn't be happier for him. This is only the beginning for him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I'm not caught off guard by making the All-Star Game. I'm still very grateful to be here and thankful to get that because it's not something you take for granted, right? Only 24 of us get to be here every year. There's 450, 500 players in the league. So that's a really big deal."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a special weekend. You've got the best players in the world. A lot of retired guys come around, and you get to see them. It's great for the fans. It's great for your family."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So that's kind of my favorite part about the weekend, just being able to bring my son, obviously, my mom, and seeing all the retired guys I grew up watching and spend time with them."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,All-Star weekend is great. Very honored to be here. Look forward to making many more.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"What makes it special is just the history of it. When I was your age, watching my favorite players compete and play in the All-Star Game and make highlights, it was a very special weekend for me to watch. I can only dream and imagine of one day being able to wear that jersey and live out my dream."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Five years ago, I made my first All-Star Game, and I've been fortunate enough to make it every single year. Just everything about All-Star weekend is special, and the game is super exciting. You get to play with guys that you're normally competing against. So that makes it different as well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"You just get to share the court with some of the greatest players to ever play, and it's just memories you'll have for the rest of your life."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Always just follow your heart, follow your dreams. Never let somebody tell you what you can or can't do. If people are not laughing at your dreams, you're probably not dreaming big enough. So reach for the moon."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, he's having a great year. Unlike any other player we've probably ever seen. At this point, I think he, for sure, deserves to be in the conversation with some other great rookies out there. Chet Holmgren at OKC. I think those would probably be the two guys off the top of my head right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I love watching him play. He's going to be incredible for a very long time. He's having a great year, and I'll continue to keep watching him do great things."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"One change, that's a funny one. If you get a tech -- bear with me. If you get a tech for overreacting to a call and you were right -- if they go back and look, the coaches do the challenge and they overturn the call, that tech should be rescinded. You should get your money back."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"If you get a tech for overreacting to a call that was deemed incorrect or whatever, you should get your money back."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Laughter.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. And I think the league is in a great place right now, the amount of high-character guys, the amount of talent throughout the NBA. The fact that LeBron and KD and Steph are still considered one of the best 10 players in the league right now at their age and how long they've been playing is incredible."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"As well as all the younger guys. Whether it's guys my age or the guys a little bit older, with the Jokices and Giannis, or guys younger than me. So I think the league is in a great place. When LeBron retires, the face of the league, that's tough. But we win a championship, I've got something to say about it, I know that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,My mom. Easy answer. My mom raised me to be the young man that I am today. I give her all the credit for all my good qualities.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Kobe. Kobe Bryant. That was my idol and the guy that inspired me to ultimately get to the point where I am today and strive to be the best version of myself.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Hot take, I probably won't score 55 points tomorrow. It's a feel thing. Starting in the game tomorrow, you get into a good rhythm, get a couple layups, maybe a couple threes, you look up, now you've got 16 points, and it's like, all right, I might try to go get it again."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I wonder who's the last person to win back-to-back All-Star Game MVPs? I'm not sure I know that. Russell Westbrook in 2015 and 2016. But if it's not going to be me, I might say -- maybe like Donovan Mitchell, maybe so. Someone from our team."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Just feel like he's athletic enough, obviously. I think a key part of it is starting, right? Probably going to play a little bit more than the rest of the guys. Is he starting? Wait, is he starting? Shoot, I might be wrong."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I had, like, 55 last year, and I think he was on my team. I want to say he might have had 40-something, so he was close. Mitchell scored 40 points. He's just somebody that can get really hot. In the All-Star Game, if you can get hot, have some electric dunks and things like that, you have a great shot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"It means the world. It means the world. I think the respect that I've gained from my peers and legends means the world to me. Just to keep meeting people where I'm from, that's not really a thing. There's no chance that they even know where Oshkosh, Wisconsin, is."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,So it means the world to me. I just want to continue to keep doing what I'm doing and gaining people's respect.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"No change. My goal is to play for USA until the wheels fall off. If I get that call to go, I'll be there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,I don't really get into that. That's something that you guys decide as media members.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I think we got a lot of different guys that it could be. The league is in great hands. It's the most talent that has even been in this league. There's a lot of different guys it could be. We'll see. To be the face of the league, winning has to come with that. Whatever young guy takes that charge and is winning moving forward, that's probably who it will be. Yeah, that's not for us to decide."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Well, I'm not on the team yet. If I were on the team, it would mean the world to me. Obviously I had a lot of fun with Team USA last year, and we didn't get the result we wanted. To be part of the team this year and have a chance at a little bit of revenge or a little bit of get-back, that would mean the world."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I think, as a kid who grew up in the 2000s, I always wanted to play for Team USA after watching the Redeem Team with LeBron and those guys. And watching D-Wade's doc for them on Netflix, and I was at the premiere with D-Wade. It would mean a lot moving forward."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Going into the Skills contest, I have no idea what that entails. Looking forward to finding that out. I do think what we have over people is chemistry because we're all together all the time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"3-Point Contest, just don't choke. Last year I had a legendary first round, and then I think I got iced a little bit. That might be the reason. But I was terrible the second round. Just some consistency this year, and hopefully I can pull off the W."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"That's a good question. I'm going to say myself, number one, of course. Then I'd probably say Shai and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. I like their style, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"It's been a zoo. It's been a lot, but it's been a lot of fun. I've been told I'm kind of like the prom king of the weekend, so just doing whatever I'm asked to do."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Coolest thing I've done? That's a good question. The IndyCar was cool. I'm trying to think. I don't know. I don't know. I did the little 2K League thing yesterday and was with Tyrese Maxey and some other 2K League guys. That was fun because I've always grown up playing the game. There's a lot of YouTubers there that I grew up watching, so it was cool to see those guys for, sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Wow, that's a great question. I'm glad I get to plug I.Y. a little bit, give him some love. Me and I.Y. hit it off right when I was in Sac, and we grew our relationship there pretty quickly. Obviously I got traded here. He was able to join me here."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"We spent a lot of time together. This is his first time living outside of California, so there's a lot of trust that he's put into me and my future and this organization's future to move here. I'm excited that he's here, and we're very, very close."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Thankful he's in my life, and thankful that I have him, that I can call him a brother, but also someone whose basketball opinion I trust more than a lot of people."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Very critical. When I get compliments from him, it means a lot because I don't get them often. He's like my mom. Yeah, I'm always -- especially a play or if I mess up or somebody else messes up, I can quickly ask him to pull up the iPad and give me a look. You see a lot of times that I have the computer or something on the bench just showing guys just because he gets it to me pretty quickly."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I know our minds are usually on the same wavelength, so that helps a lot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I appreciate the love. It's super cool to be on Chinese social, interacting with fans. That means a lot to me. So I appreciate that. I feel like that has a lot to do with me being first in fan votes. I know people see a player in Indiana and don't expect that, but the love I've received from my fans in China has been amazing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I'm trying to think. What comes to mind? Have you ever seen that commercial where the dude goes to the ref and says like, Coach, I touched this, their ball, and then the ref switches the call? Terrible. I don't know what brand that was, but that was awful."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"For sure. I'll be Chad. I'll be the sidekick. Me and Ant, if Disney wants to rock with us, we'd be down. We could do it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I think winning games speaks for itself. That's why everybody plays the game. That's why you watch the game. You want your teams to win. It's everybody's ultimate goal, and I think that obviously this year we've gotten off to a really good start in that category. I think winning games is the biggest."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I honestly try to stay very present, try to stay in the moment, not look too far ahead, not look back and kind of just take advantage of every moment, whether it's me working or it's me just being grateful for where I am today. I try to just stay in the moment, and it's worked out pretty good thus far. So I try to continue to do so."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I have no clue. I think that's your guys' job to decide and figure out. But it will be an amazing league regardless. Obviously, he's done amazing things for this league and for the game of basketball. You don't want to take him for granted, obviously. But when he's gone, yeah, it will still be great."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I've just found so much success from, not blocking it out, but not letting it faze me or control me. I think I've just learned through that experience and figure out what works for me and then try to run with it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"To this point, it's not any harder, because I've grown through it being hard, I think, in the past."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It's amazing. It's a good feeling, just seeing the thing develop, not only for myself, but for my peers and guys that I'm around all the time and guys that are like brothers to me, just because we do everything together. It's exciting. Not only for myself, like I said."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"We've just got to try to keep pushing forward. Whatever's been working, just try to continue to do so and keep getting better."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Good question. I'm not too sure. Usually experience, the teams that have gone through multiple playoff series and multiple guys that have gotten to that level know what it takes to get over the hump and do so. That's something that, honestly, just has to come with us playing in more games. Maybe we give it time. Maybe we don't."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"But we have no ceiling on what we think we can do this year. We kind of take the same mentality and just stay in the moment, plug away every day. Where we get at the end of the year, whenever the end of our season is, we'll look back and make adjustments and try to figure out then. As of right now, we just try to stay focused on the task at hand."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I don't think it's a message to the rest of the league. I think it's a mentality, almost like a message to ourselves that the job's not finished, not even close. We're a little bit more than halfway through the season."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"But our goal wasn't to be 37-17 halfway through the season. We want bigger things and better things. Obviously, we're not done. So, yeah, I think it's more of a message to ourselves."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"He's super, super humble, a great guy, first and foremost. Really down to earth, easy to talk to, easy to work with. Easy to get along with."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Then as far as on the court, he has an ability to -- he always understands what the right thing to say is. And the things that matter, he always emphasizes. When he speaks, guys listen and guys understand that it's something that is going to make or break our team."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I think that over time we've seen his -- not only his development, but we've seen kind of his schemes and his work coming to life and really lead this pack and steer us in the right way. We all have his respect and appreciate him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I'm not too sure. I think no matter what there's like a fine line in -- like when it comes down to it, there's always a fine line in games played and availability. I think the league has the right intention in trying to make that line a little bit bolder and easier to make a decision."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Now, I try to be as available as I can every night, not only for that, but just for the love of the game. But as far as how the rule goes, I don't really have an opinion. I'm going to try to be available for my team to win basketball games every night. If I can't be available, then I just can't. It is what it is."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Work on your craft as much as possible. Pretty cliche. But I would say be a star in your role -- that's also a cliche. I think when guys figure out what their game is going to look like, what their roles are going to be, and then attack it with everything they've got, you find the most success. I'd say that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"When I see those high-scoring games, I just think about the skill that has come into the league and how great these players really are and how great offense is always going to beat great defense all the time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"You watch Luka's 70-point game, and he's making tough shot after tough shot. I definitely feel like someone can break that 80-point. 100 points would be tough to do in a game. You've got to make every shot and get a lot of shots up to get to 100. But I think somebody could get 80."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"I think each era has about six or seven guys that help carry the game forward, help push the game forward. It's more than just Steph and LeBron and myself. It's the James Hardens, Russell Westbrooks, Kawhi Leonards, Paul Georges, a lot of these guys who inspired the next generation of hoopers to want to be professionals. There's more than just one or two guys."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"You look around the league -- I'm going to miss a lot of guys, but you see Shai, Ant, Book, Luka, Tyrese Maxey, Tyrese Haliburton. There are so many guys inspiring the next generation of hoopers after them to become basketball players that you can't just pinpoint it to one or two guys."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"It's about pushing the game forward, setting a different standard, how we play. These guys are doing it right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"That's a tough question. You put me on the spot. If I had to say one, I would say probably Game 6, 2012 Western Conference Finals, up 3-2 against San Antonio. We were down 20 at the half at home, and we had to rally to get to the Finals. At 23 years old, that was probably something that stood out the most."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Because we hang out off the floor. I think that's most of the battle. When you get to know your teammates that deep, we almost to this point know what each other is thinking. I hung out with him a lot since I got to Phoenix and this past summer, and we worked out obviously."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Hanging out, playing video games, going out, having a drink. All that stuff helps when you're trying to gain chemistry as a team. It's been great getting to know him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Same thing. I feel like we're both confident players. But when you've got that extra support out there to just go do what you do, sometimes you need that, especially when you're one of the lead guys on the team. You focus on so much other stuff -- your teammates, scheme, strategies -- and sometimes you need somebody to relieve you of all that stuff and just go play, and that's what we do for one another."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Also, our coaching staff does that for us, as well, and our teammates. When you've got support like that, it just makes you a way better player."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Whenever Drake just wants to talk about life, I'm just there for him. And then he just gave me that title."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,I doubt I have an album dropping. I just do it for fun.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"""Hi."" That's it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"I think I've had great chemistry with every point guard. I think, to be honest, I played longer with Russ, so I think I probably have more chemistry with him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"We came up together as 19-year-olds. We played eight seasons together, and he knew me inside-out. Obviously, I had great success with Steph. I don't want to discredit that. But I don't want to also discredit what me and Russ did, as well, as a duo."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying laughter."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited to get out there and learn and take it all in, so I can't wait."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"'26 is definitely our goal for certainly the next one, and then shortly thereafter, if not then, or a year or two after. So by '28, I'd say I'd feel pretty confident we'll be at 16 teams."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"All-Star Weekend is special, and it's always more special when you get to share it with a teammate or two. I've been fortunate enough to share it with him three times now. It was great. It was great to have a teammate, familiar face around, especially we get to share the same locker room."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"For me, it's not any more difficult. I think I've learned through experience -- and obviously as a young kid it's easy to get caught up in it, just going back to high school and rankings and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"I loved it. The shorter introductions, not being on the stage and all that, I'm definitely a fan of that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No, I prepared her at halftime. I just felt, going with a bigger lineup, I said, okay, be ready, we may go for a big lineup. So Nyara, you're coming in."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's got to be MJ, I guess. I mean, he was the best."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"This is very humbling, very blessed, and it's something I will never forget obviously. It's part of my journey."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"Fortunately, I've been around a few times, so it wasn't my first time. But it's always a blessing, especially for the older guys. You've got Steph, LeBron, KD. Those three in particular, those are Hall of Famers, top-tier guys. It's always a blessing to share the court. As long as you can, you treasure those moments. Hopefully I'm talked about in the same category as my career continues to move forward."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,This is actually going to be my first time in Chicago. I'm really excited. I've heard really good things about it. You have some of the best pizzas. I'm excited to get there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Doing it in front of my family and them be able to come to New York, it just means a lot."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I hadn't been shooting the three ball well all night, but when I needed them to go in, they definitely did. God was good. I just was honored to be in the moment. I definitely tried to go the reverse through the legs. I couldn't make it in the All-Star Game, but I made it in a real game. Kind of funny how I did that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be patient. You've got to be patient. They're not always going to do things that you like. Be patient because they're kids. I think that's the most important thing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think it's beautiful. I took a lot of risk. I left France when I was 17. So I did the last two years in Germany. I felt like it was a risk, and I believed in myself. I worked a lot and stayed confident."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think just my teammates and how much time we spent together. I think that's something I'll miss, all the memories and things like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in."
