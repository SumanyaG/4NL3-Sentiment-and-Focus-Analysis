2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I think the players, the players deserve all the credit for the show that we are being treated to. I thought both teams played well. It was a good game. Obviously both teams, things you can point to -- you wish you made a layup or you wish you didn't do this or that. That's the way a game always is."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"But no, I'm looking forward to seeing what the ratings are for this one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"The same defense as always. Try to make it as hard as possible for them to get the shots they want. They are good players. They are going to get shots off. But they can't get easy ones. So that's my goal, to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it's an epitome of the year she's had and how important she's been to the team. Shot making, big three. She's a hustle-play player, so that was on display. Go give yourself a chance to maybe either put it in or get fouled."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,That's just what she does every day we are around her. She's the same. You can always count on her to be there for you. We're obviously super proud of Bridget.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Same. I completely agree. I feel like Bridget is just so reliable every time. Like Coach said, we can bank on her to make those hustle plays and to be cool and collected at the end to make those free throws. That's the hardest shot, honestly, in basketball, is to make free throws at the end of the game. To make those at the down at the big moment is who BC is."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,They were saying Naz Reid free tattoos. I think BC free tattoos is next.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I think you hit the nail on the head. It's unfortunate those teams were a joy to watch. But it's a sign of the times where we are now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't know about these guys, but I know when I'm out and I'm in different places and I'm going to one, everyone is talking about it. Everyone is talking to me about it, talking about, I go to this bar, and this is a bar that maybe wouldn't have a women's game on five years ago. All the TVs have the game on and the volume on, and the place is going crazy. I heard that so many times in different establishments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,And obviously I appreciate the opportunity that A Bar of Their Own has given women in making that front and center. I'm happy to support a woman-owned business like that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that what this team has done, obviously the Wolves energized the city in their playoff run, and I'm thrilled to see the same energy came for this team because they deserve it. Obviously the crowd was there tonight, but even more than that, everywhere you go around the city, people are talking about the Lynx."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"It's really tough. I think we are both great players. It was Game 4 and we played each other, what, four times in the regular season. It's going to get harder and harder each time to get the shots that you normally get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Everyone is out there to do the same thing make shots hard. That's my goal every time. She's a great player, one of the best players in the world. But you have to make it as hard as you can for her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to answer the second part, the Game 5. I don't really think about the other ones. I do feel very blessed in my career to have a chance to have been a part of so many. Haven't won them all. You know, when I was in Detroit, we suffered a heartbreak at home. So it runs the gamut. I think that what I'm just thrilled about is that this group gets to experience the Game 5."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It's beyond words how we feel about this team, and we just so wanted them to be in the Finals, No. 1 and two, put themselves in a position to win a championship, and we've done just that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't get a response from the league. I have a text to prove it. I think that -- I think Phee has some things to prove that the fouls weren't called.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"That's unfortunate. You know, I guess I don't really have much more than that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Wish I knew. I'd either not eat or not sleep or I'd sleep really good if I knew the difference. It's two great teams. Who knows? Who knows.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I wanted to come out and enjoy the moment and be as aggressive as possible. When you're playing for your season, after the last game you sit with everything, and you erase it and you want to leave all those internal feelings and put it out there and embrace the crowd."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I just wanted to be out there with my teammates and give it everything we had. Shots go in, they don't go in, whatever. There are always things you can fix. But I was just excited to be out there and compete again after the last game. Shots were falling. That's always a good thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,We were celebrating together and she was saying how proud she is of us and the team. I was telling her that she has to get her butt to New York.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Anybody that has been following along knows this team, from the beginning of the season all the way through to Game 4, has this unique ability to believe in themselves and believe in each other. What we said before the game, can we do it in the toughest of times, right. Because this will be the most that we are tested. We talked about it in shootaround. This will be the most this group has been tested in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I was sure how we would connect and compete. Not sure whether you're going to win the game or not. But I was sure that we were going to be the Minnesota Lynx and how we have done things all season long. You know, the ups and downs and all of that, this group is just equipped to handle it. It's special."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It was expected. Going into the game, we talked about it in the pregame that we were going into the game as if that didn't happen. Whatever was going to show itself was going to show itself and we were going to react. But we didn't have any minute restrictions and anything else we were doing to modify. Just competed."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"We did try to get some players off the floor a little bit more. This one Collier -- we thought about it. But I think overall I was concerned about leaving Lan too long on the bench, sitting too long. But other than that, we weren't concerned."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, Ceci is tough. You know, goes through a stretch of games where maybe she's not contributing like she wants to contribute, and then all of a sudden we had a Ceci sighting at shootaround the other day and these last two games really helping us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy for her. We've always stayed in touch through the years. We've always tried to get her back here. Timing was good for this one, and she's been a great fit for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Sounds like he's rooting for them. He didn't text that to me.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I love it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,Huskies drama.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Looks like I'm going to have to text him about some things now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Bench was really important. We knew they were going to be. They were ready. They were ready. There was a lot of conversations, the teammates, getting them going and getting them ready to be able to make contributions when they got in the game. Give Dorka credit as she remained patient, and when she got the opportunity, I thought her minutes were good. We'll look at the video. But it was nice to be able to have players able to sub in and stay out there for extended time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Is that why we missed layups so we can get down to the nitty-gritty? Is that what she's saying? Laughter.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. Laughter. My heart is still racing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think we gain energy and confidence from one another. I feel like internally we are strong, strong-minded mentally and physically. We have a lot of belief within our group. We problem solve with each other. It's just a belief, like, internally. I don't know how else to explain it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"I think we're excited. I don't even know if I'm thinking about that. I'm thinking that it's a Game 5 of the Finals, that we need to go out and execute. That's really all I'm thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, last 40 minutes of the season. It could be anywhere, really. It doesn't matter. We are going to be out there together going to war, and I'm pumped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Elite players play no matter the environment, home, road. Elite players play and they love the environment and they are not affected by the environment. That's why you see the series has been what it has, winning on each other's court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to say probably information gathered in the three games. Everything is getting harder. So the edge that maybe other games that provided each team, there's no secrets at this point."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I actually was trying to call a timeout, but they didn't hear me. So that's on me. But yeah, you know, it wasn't our best possession. It was loud in here. I don't know, maybe I just have to sprint out in the middle of the court next time. So I've got to be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think that I was going a little bit too fast. I just needed to slow down. They are sending multiple people when I'm slipping on a screen, stuff like that. A little bit better awareness on my part. But quick turnaround and be ready for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"With the two seconds? Yeah, it was like a little screen to get JJ to the block. If not, Sabrina had to come out. So with two seconds, we tried to establish the big girl down low. They defended it well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, obviously they are great players. I think Stewie said it, we took some shots, we probably could have moved it a little bit more."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, I will say this, and I look at the thing here and I know Cheryl talked about it last time, but we got no calls today. So do I need to talk up in a press conference? Because they were getting ticky-tacks. And we went down there and got hit and get nothing. It was like 12-6 at halftime and they tried to even it up near the end. It was 14-9."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No. All we want is fair, okay. So if we are getting hit, that's a foul. You know, I'm one of the nicest bloody coaches in this league, but this pisses me off. Just be fair. You know, if they are getting hit, it's a bloody foul."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that expletive timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,JONQUEL JONES,It's a close-out game. Their backs are against the wall and we are trying to win. It was going to be that type of game tonight where we are both trying to claw and both teams are trying to figure out whatever to do to get over the hump.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, that's what we said we worked for all season long. Minnesota did what they needed to do here to tie it up, and now we go back home. We love playing in front of our home crowd."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So it will definitely be another sellout, and it will definitely be loud. And we have to bring our ""A"" game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I have a lot of respect for Minnesota, don't get me wrong. This is a really tough team, really tough team. They play well. They compete. So we've got one more game, and we're going to win on our home court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"Short-term memory. Just the fact that all that happened tonight is the series is even, and there's a Game 5, winner-take-all. We are going back to New York, and we're going to get it done. You know, getting it done there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, of course. We wanted to get it done tonight. But like Sandy said, our fans are like no other, and to be able to go into our environment on Sunday, know they have our backs. So whenever there are tough situations, whenever we're fighting through all of this adversity, we know we have the crowd behind us. That's just going to continue to motivate us. Yeah, can't wait for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that, you know, for our team, we bounce back after a loss really, really well, and making sure that everybody is on the same page going forward."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"In the playoffs, in a series, there's going to be momentum shifts. There were momentum shifts in the game tonight. But mentally, understanding what's our ultimate goal, how are things going right here. Like Sandy said in the locker room, we haven't won anything yet we haven't lost anything yet. And we have the opportunity to do that Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, I thought as you said, we had the appropriate effort and focus on what we were doing. As the game wore on, the offense got harder and harder for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that one of the things, and you know, like I was saying after Game 1, you feel like the ball isn't moving enough, and I think we got easy stuff when we were able to do that. We were taking hard shots. We had good shots. Didn't make shots, right, and that's what it comes down to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Stewie was making shots. JJ's big three when we were up four, that was a big three. Then obviously Ionescu's shot at the end. It's a battle. We talked about that, players making plays. Unfortunately, we didn't make enough of them to put the ball in the hole."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I mean, I'll let these guys talk about that. Go ahead, you guys. Jump in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I feel like they were making plays at the end of shot clocks and like Coach said, we were getting really good looks. We just weren't executing on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's just hard when you get that and then obviously they are a great offensive team and like Coach said in the locker room, it just puts a lot of pressure on our defense. I think we just need to make more shots, honestly."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't have an update, game finished what, 15 minutes ago? I haven't talked to the trainer."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,KAYLA McBRIDE,Great player made a good shot. I guarded her for 40 minutes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, obviously give credit to Lan. She did what should he could do. We were plus 20 when she was on the floor. So it obviously hurt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our starting five is a really good starting five, and you know, not having Lan, foul trouble, and then just not feeling like she could go put us in a bit of a bind."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, tried different things. You know, just a little bit of a small lineup. See if we could spread the floor and get some easier shots but that didn't produce itself either. We need our starters, just like they need their starters."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't necessarily know that it was -- obviously got fouled. She was, you know, asserting herself in that way. The game is called differently for Phee than it is for Stewie for sure. You look at the same level of activity, and around-the-rim contact. For whatever reason, we have a hard time getting to the foul line in this series."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I think they were getting some switches that they were picking on. You know, as Lan was switching on her. She made some great plays. She attacked, she made threes, she got it going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our defense gave us a chance to win the game. Our defense gave us a chance to win the game, period, and our offense is going to help our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"If you told me that we would have got the amount of stops that we did and we were playing off that, and we wouldn't have scored 80, that would be surprising to me. This team scored 80, its 77-all with the remaining seconds left."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I'll have to look at the film. I know when I was watching it live, I liked some of the shots that we were getting. I've seen our players make those shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, it's not to sit here and say, you know, that New York doesn't get credit for, you know, their defense. Just they are a good defensive team. I'll have to watch it but I felt like we got some good opportunities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, yeah. We just need to score the ball a couple times. Just a couple times. We were up four. Like I said, that JJ three sort of changed things for them, right. If we get that stop and we just score one or two more times, that's our game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's a hard-fought game, right. Really great game. That's one that, you know, we convert just a couple and it's our game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"So, our defense, and like the things that you mentioned, we did those things. We played well enough at that end. Obviously, it seems crazy to say when Stewie has 30 but you know, she had 38, 39 on us and they only scored 78, 79 points. We were right there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,For sure. For sure. That's what we just talked about. This is Phee's first Finals. So she's feeling these things for the first time. K-Mac has been there.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"The hardest thing to do, I imagine you guys feel it when you are watching, there's so many ups and downs and swings and all around, and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to sort of weather those swings, and here we are. We're disappointed. We're home. We played well and just couldn't come up with the win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's important that you don't get too high when you win and too low when you lose, and it's really hard. It's really, really hard but we've got to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home with our tremendous fans. And you know, we'll see what we can do on Friday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it feels great. I mean, that's something that -- obviously it's the ultimate goal is to be here and to get a win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Doesn't feel great right now, obviously, with a loss. But I am excited to look at film and see what we can do better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it feels amazing. The crowd was awesome. To play at home in the Finals is such a rush. So definitely looking forward to the next game.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Her contributions today, she was back to being BC for us. So we were glad to see that, and we'll continue that into game four."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,That was just a great All WNBA Second-Team performance laughter. That's it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I mean, you know, in the time-out, Sandy kind of was just like, you're going to shoot this shot. You know, I feel like I was able to get a little separation in range and get a really good shot to go. Obviously wanting to let the shot clock wind down. And got the space that I needed to get my feet under me and felt comfortable taking that shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn't. I've practiced that shot a thousand times in my head, on the court, and I feel like that's just something that as athletes, you put yourself in that position to want to be able to make a shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"And obviously like we don't win this game without Stewie. What she was able to do, just continued to chip away. Obviously she'll speak, but I mean, yeah, there's nothing I could say. Like that shot's nice but that doesn't go against what she's been able to do for us tonight and how she was able to just will us back into that game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we were all kind of just waiting for our moment. You know, waiting for the script to flip a little bit. You know, they talked about it. They talked about first five minutes, going to come out punching. They punched us in the face in the first quarter and we continued to wear them down."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We knew that our pace was something that made them tired and for me, it was just kind of like I was motivated. I was mad. And I liked my matchups that I had, and really kind of attacking them to make sure that we could get this back into where we needed to be for it to be a ballgame."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Just continuing to kind of be in help side and know that we did some different schemes. We sometimes were sending two to the ball and then leaving somebody open and making sure that, you know, between JJ and I, like we are going to protect the rim at all costs and make sure that nothing is easy, because this is the Finals and everything is going to be tough and we're going to make everybody work for it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,That's why I can't be miked up.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I'm not sure exactly what the situation was. Might have been when it was 71-69, because I feel like we were at that score for a long time. But just I could feel it. You know, you could feel the momentum was shifting to our side."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"They were up and their shots weren't falling. We were getting good looks, and it's like, if we are going to be this close, we are not leaving here without this win. It's tough to play in this arena, but the way that we continued to stay together is something that I'm not shocked at but I am really proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,I was mad we were losing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We know we're one game away from winning the championship, and I think that they are going to give us their best shot. They are going to give everything they have got, and you know what, so are we. The turnaround is quick but we are going to continue to be ready. There's a lot of things that we didn't do right tonight and have a kind of quick memory. I think that we're happy we got this win but we're -- the job's not done."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I just went up and gave him a big shot. Him and Jodie Berry, our assistant coach came down and he kind of told me the same thing, like there was never a doubt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Obviously him, Sandy, all the coaches that I've had, just their continued belief and pouring into me means the world to me whether I make or miss that shot. Like the fact that they kind of trusted me to go out there and make big shots, that's why I love playing for this team and continue to pour my all."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's pretty special. It was never in doubt. Obviously Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there, but I thought the right time, this is Sabrina. She just made a big shot. She's a great shooter and she just needed a little bit of separation."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, definitely the biggest shot of my career and hopefully not the last."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,It did. Pretty nice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Not for us. I think that, you know, this feels like we're playing on their home court, and I feel like each game is so different. You know, you go from 1 to 2 to 3. But the way that we continue to fight and be resilient. I don't want to speak for you guys. Doesn't feel like Game 1 to me. Feels like Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"At this point, I don't know."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think -- well, I think the way that we fought back in the second, knowing that our offense didn't really click yet but we were able to limit them defensively. But then in the third, when we had a strong push, a strong punch. You guys know the first two games, our third quarters have been a struggle to score offensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We were getting downhill. We were attacking and we were being confident. If a mistake happened, like a turnover or a missed shot or like something just doesn't go our way, we didn't panic. We continued to play and continued to fight through it because we know how big this moment is. We have the experience of the good, bad, ugly, and different."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, we didn't come out how we wanted to start the game. We knew they'd threw the first punch. I thought we weren't playing how we wanted to play physically, mentally with the pace and everything. But credit to them. They were taking us out of stuff that we wanted to do and they were making big shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I trust this team. I feel like we've grown so much. We've handled adversity even from Game 1, you know what I mean? It's like, okay, this is a totally different game here and we just had to chip away."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I did. I felt confident. Even with that last shot I felt confident, okay, because we worked hard and we found a way to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think that what the big three means is between Sab, JJ and myself, we know when it's our time to step up and to make an impact. And over the course of the game, it's like sometimes things are hard. Sometimes things are frustrating. I pick up two fouls in the first quarter. But knowing that our team trusts and believes in us to be in this position to take these shots, to help get the game in the right place, but at the same time we wouldn't be here without our teammates, and having that trust and belief just gives us confidence."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't know. Like, you guys talk about the run, Sab's shot. There was so many players that came in that were like such an important piece of what we were able to do tonight just because they made Minny tired and that's what makes this team really special. It's a collective win even though some of us are shining a little bit brighter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I think it's important to just read the game, and being able to get downhill and find JJ on a really important basket that, helped us late in the game. Because you're just not really one-dimensional. The defense doesn't know what you're going to do Are you going to shoot it are you going to pass it? Are you going to be a screener, a decoy? There's just so many opportunities that when you have the gravity we have to be able to make it tough on the defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"JJ was huge for us. The way that she protected the rim, hit a huge three, hit that layup, like just continue to go chip away, and it was a total team effort. Like Stewie said, we're not here without every single person on this team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,Just in the locker room waiting on Stewie. I would say I really didn't realize how far out I was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, like I kind of, you know, wasn't sure if I was dribbling with my right or left hand and then I was like, oh, yeah, I did hit that step-back."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I just didn't really realize how far I was, but like I said, it's a shot that I take often and I take in practice and that I take before the game. It's not like a Hail Mary, hope this goes in. It's like, once I got it off, I was like, yeah, this is in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I was really, really happy with Nyara. It was the plan to give her a few more extra minutes tonight. Stewie came in a little sooner because Stewie got two fouls early."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She played so hard. She was winded by the end of those seven minutes. We played her seven minutes in a row but she was so effective. Just the ability, they were being so aggressive, and what Nyara brings is she's always on her front foot getting downhill. She's always going to run the floor, just a hundred miles an hour, which is what we needed."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So it's been great to see her growth, and yeah, it was never in doubt there. But obviously I went to Slooty early, too, and I thought that changed the pace of the game. We struggled a little bit. Not often do I sit both of these at the same time, very rarely. But I felt like we needed to at that moment, and I think they gave us really good energy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We got it back to ten after that first quarter, and I think that was the thing. We've got to keep grinding, keep grinding, and as the game went on, we got back to playing Liberty Basketball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Our offense was bad at a time when we really needed it. Our pace was slow. Taking too long to get into things, and you know, I don't think we were terribly hard to play against from that standpoint. And that was obviously a difficult time to be doing that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm disappointed that we let it get to 17. I'm more disappointed in that. I'm more than disappointed, I'm pissed that that happened again."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Sure, did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It's hard. You have to adjust to the refs. Definitely it's not an excuse. We played really bad. I'm definitely not using that as an excuse.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it's hard to adjust because you are playing one way and you are getting used to the refs and then they change it up. But that's not why we lost. It wasn't them. It was us. Can't blame that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,It's been talked about a lot. This is a group that problem solves well together. They never think they are out of it. Their belief in themselves and their belief in each other is top-notch. And we know it's a long game. They are very experienced.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"We just knew what we had to clean up, get some things cleaned up and we did that then. Put ourselves in position, right where we wanted to be and just couldn't get over the hump."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't think it affected the game. I don't know if it affected her play. Phee can answer that. It was a chance to get her three minutes of rest and at the end of the quarter, that was fine, and then she went back in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,So it didn't affect us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Huge difference. So both games they have gotten help from part of their -- they have a big five, right, their starters are all very capable, just like our starters are all very capable and you need players beyond your stars, and for two games, they have done that. We're having trouble getting that consistently and we've got to have that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I mean, yeah, obviously you want to steal one on the road. We're really disappointed I think in how we played today but excited to go home and play in front of our crowd, and we have to respond. We have to come out playing better than we did in these two games."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's hard. Like we are both competing for a championship. You have to play with a level of desperation from the very beginning, and so that's what we're going to need to do to come out in Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I honestly don't feel like I changed my mindset. I feel like I stayed aggressive on defense. I was frustrated that I had those four fouls but I don't think it affected me in the way that I was playing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"No, I happen to agree with you. I had a chance to talk to Joe Ingles, I don't know if I told Lan this when we were in Minnesota, and he asked me how I liked my Australian. And we talked about all the ways that we love the way that Lan plays and her level of compete, and that's what Joe said. He's like, one thing you're darned sure an Australian is going to do is compete their tails off."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"And Lan is the very definition of that. Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how difficult it is. Lan is always there for us in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"We were trying to get another ball handler out there, somebody they had to pay attention to, try to get downhill a little bit, try to create some easier opportunities playing with flow. Setups weren't necessarily producing anything for us, so we just thought, spread the floor and play with two ball handlers."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Well, I mean, what did she have at half, 12? Ten of them were in fast break. Ten of them were fast break. So what changed is she wasn't able to get it in the fast break and we had her in the halfcourt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,I think Stewie is the same. I don't think making her missing a shot or free throw. We do this long enough that those things happen. She's resilient. She played exactly like we thought she would. I thought she played great in Game 1.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"And so you know, I think her impact defensively was something that we felt. You know, what did she have, seven steals? And so you know, she's been doing that in these playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"More than that, in my mind -- you have to ask Stewie, but I don't think that's what was on her mind. I think what was on their collective minds is it's a must-win game for them and they came out and played like it was, and they took the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, but I think the opponent has a fair amount to do with it. We have to come up with better opportunities and better things that we can do offensively so that we can get back to a little bit more of a balanced scoring."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,So I think that's most important to say is New York has had a lot to do with this.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"You've got players that are playing a lot of minutes, a lot of heavy minutes, and any time you can get your bench to come in and be productive and you can keep them out there longer, that's an advantage."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"But I don't think either bench has been necessarily a separator. We talked about Hiedeman in the last game. She scored it. I think she had ten, right. So that was impactful."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"But you know, both teams are looking for anywhere else you can go so that you don't have all this pressure on your top players."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"What we continued to keep saying to one another was like stay together, keep playing. Every rebound matters. And even if our offense gets a little bit stagnant and funky, we are not going to let that dictate what we do defensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, massive. They have been going under on screens so we encouraged her to shoot the three. She's a great three-point shooter. She was stroking it yesterday in practice before the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, she was digging deep and that's what we needed. We knew we needed to bounce back and it was a big bounce-back game. They contained Leonie a little bit after what she did in Game 1 but B helped us get this margin to win the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. Just like not letting history repeat itself and knowing that Game 1 happened but now, you know, how can we control Game 2 and I think that honestly the thought process was, we were trying to be up a little bit more. Like not letting them get to the three-point line to set up their offense. And then in to out, whether I'm helping, I know that Sab or whoever else is helping on my backside, and making them have to move just a little bit quicker than they want to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"No. Honestly -- sorry, I'll just rant laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I kind of texted him and I was like, you know what it's about time that you come to my game. I've been here for two years and he hasn't come down. What are you doing? Yeah, CD Dailey came and she got that same message, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a long drive.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,Two hours.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B brings is this grit, this toughness, knowing that -- and all of us know, she's giving us whatever she's got, and the way that she continued to be aggressive, they were going under on her and she knocked that thing down with confidence, got into the paint, drive and kicks."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,But that's what we're used to. We know she can do this and happy to see her get into a good rhythm with everything that's been up and down this season and know that she's a big factor in everything we do.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think that the first thing was higher pick-up points, knowing that if Leo was going to be up, really trying to limit Courtney Williams, then I need to be there, too. So when Phee is dribbling up it's without any pressure."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"That's really what my goal was, was just take what the defense gives me and not forcing anything but understanding I'm going to be able to drive and kick. And players hit, multiple players hit really big shots. But obviously I think coming out like that was great for us to get going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"And then in the second half, they made some adjustments and I think it was understanding being able to drive passing lanes and find the open man, if they are going to bring a few on the ball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,So I just did that. I don't always need to be looking to score every single time I have the ball. Just continue to make the right read and understanding what it is that provides our best offense as a team.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think everyone has seen her. She's been struggling but she's been feeling good these last few days, can tell you that much. She has been."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We just knew it was a bit of time. We've given her so much rest here and she was ready to go. She puts the work in. Like I said, she's tough. We talked about the grittiness that she gives us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But it's great that you put the ball in her hand and be more of a playmaker, because it takes a little bit more pressure off these two in particular. I thought that was very effective for us. But her defense, she was everywhere. She was guarding everyone. I'm really happy for her. We just have to freshen up and get ready for the next game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B and I were continuing to say in the huddles was defensively, you know, the schemes because they went small. So it means our matchups are a little bit different. And making sure that we have each other's help. If we are weak side, who is high, who is low. Just those type of things, and knowing that like scores and stops, we're playing the long game in the last two minutes, and making sure that we are all are on the same page."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I mean, I think we missed her grittiness and just she's the ultimate competitor. She takes pride -- she used to always guard the best player and obviously now we have Leo, too, that makes us really a versatile defensive team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But you also miss her play-making. That's something we talked about this year. We wanted to make sure she could play-make more and it was hard for to play-make when she was hobbling around with the knee. We need her to get confidence first, and then to go out and play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She's just impactful because she plays at both ends of the floor, and plays hard, and she's a winner. So happy that she got the success tonight and keep building on it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Well, I'm not from here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Geno. Vivian, has been here for B. It's great."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a full house tonight. It was really loud.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,Largest crowd ever.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Loudest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,BREANNA STEWART Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,She's not from here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,I'm not from here. Loudest? Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'm not from here. It's great. We talked about the winner is women's basketball, WNBA. So many fans coming out to watch these amazing players play, but yeah, they are all welcome. All coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,My coach is coming to Minnesota.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,Okay. Kelly is coming.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,SABRINA IONESCU Go Ducks.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think the moment the game ended Thursday night, I was looking forward to Sunday, just to be able to kind of change things, change the narrative a little bit, and know that I'm going to come out and be the same that I was and be obviously better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But throughout this entire process, my team has my back every step of the way and was just excited to have another opportunity to go to battle with them. Because we have a lot of fun in everything that we do, and you know, it's not always like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"It was the difference in this last game. I think that especially after watching the film of Game 1, we slowed down to a pace that is a little bit awkward for us. We want to play fast and we want to move the ball and we want to get downhill and we want to score, obviously."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"So making sure that no matter what, we continue to play fast, we get good shots and we get that defense moving."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Understanding how teams are playing me and being able to make that adjustment in real time. Possession by possession, quarter by quarter, teams have kind of changed the way they have guarded, whether they are switching, hedging, trapping. And I think being able to just be poised and understanding what it is that I need to do in order to create an advantage for the team that we have out there on the floor is what I've always wanted to do, and I feel like I've been able to do that in a really good spot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,Obviously my teammates set really good screens and are able to get me open in order for me open to create for them.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"I'd say it worked pretty well for us, understanding that we use our big lineup and knowing that, you know, we can get the ball inside. We can switch. We're able to apply pressure defensively with our length and being able to get steals and just disrupt their flow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"But obviously it's a series and it's a chess match and they are going to throw different adjustments, and I think our ability to stay poised and being able to kind of see what it is that they are doing in real time is going to be crucial."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,Now we have seen their small ball lineup and we're going to go back and find ways that we can execute while they have that group on the floor.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we weren't happy the way we played we and we talked about our principles of play. We have it on our wall, there's a way that we want to play when we are at out best, when we are at pace and moving it, setting good screens and getting second and third side when we need it, but with a good inside-outside attack. We came out, and I think that was very effective for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,We always want to try to get the ball to JJ. They bring a lot of congestion and we probably would have liked to put it in more cleaner in some areas but she demands so much attention down there. I thought the are best thing was obviously just getting on the boards. I think she was fantastic for us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And that's what we need. You know, some games you are going to get more touches than other games and shoot but it's more about playing in the right way and sharing the ball and good to great. I think shot selection wasn't great last game. So it's about making those adjustments and continue to play the way that we want to play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was thinking no, no, she's up -- no, no, she's going to shoot it. But a three-point shot is a layup for her. We encourage her to shoot all those threes. I know she missed one just before it. But I love the confidence that she brings."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We talk about her being a rookie. She's not really a rookie. She has this experience in really big moments and the mindset to handle this atmosphere extremely well, and to make a play like that, I mean, I love it. She's an amazing player and an amazing human being."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, you know, I think kind of piggybacking off of the question that I answered from Pepper, it's understanding when I'm getting into the paint, the defense has to make a decision. They are either going to come and take me or they are going to play, you know two on one on the back side, and there's Leo and B in the corner, and as a defender, you just have to take your pick between the two."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"I was able to just drive in, look her off, and obviously B -- a corner three for B is a layup as well. She shoots that at a really high clip and really well. So I kind of baited Alanna Smith into thinking I was going to pass it high. And B hit a huge shot for us that changed the momentum of the game and continued to extended the lead. I think they called a time-out a little bit after that. It was huge for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"We believe in her. She knows that. This was a huge game. She played a huge role in the game ending up the way that it did and she's going to continue to do it for these next two games, we know that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I think we've been in these moments before on opposing court when it gets really, really loud, and it's more about making sure we stay true to who we are. We kind of know how we want to play. We know that they are going to make runs. We know the crowd is going to get into it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But we've just got to continue to play -- stay true to who the New York Liberty are, and if we can do that, we can overcome any obstacle."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We have had great starts in both games, but I thought our -- how much they were talking in the huddle, you know, it wasn't just me talking all the time. They're going ""We have got to rebound. The possession game."""
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just thought, when we play like that, with the pace that we went out and just the effort and the energy we put into the defensive side with the scramble and the help, good things happen. It was just more about staying persistent."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We kept Minnesota to 27 points in that second half, that's pretty good. And some of our scramble defense, we were down 1-0. So you know, we should be playing like that. And now we can tidy up some things and they can tidy up some things as well, too. We'll look forward to playing another tough game on Wednesday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying laughter."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited to get out there and learn and take it all in, so I can't wait."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"'26 is definitely our goal for certainly the next one, and then shortly thereafter, if not then, or a year or two after. So by '28, I'd say I'd feel pretty confident we'll be at 16 teams."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"All-Star Weekend is special, and it's always more special when you get to share it with a teammate or two. I've been fortunate enough to share it with him three times now. It was great. It was great to have a teammate, familiar face around, especially we get to share the same locker room."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"For me, it's not any more difficult. I think I've learned through experience -- and obviously as a young kid it's easy to get caught up in it, just going back to high school and rankings and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"I loved it. The shorter introductions, not being on the stage and all that, I'm definitely a fan of that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No, I prepared her at halftime. I just felt, going with a bigger lineup, I said, okay, be ready, we may go for a big lineup. So Nyara, you're coming in."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's got to be MJ, I guess. I mean, he was the best."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"This is very humbling, very blessed, and it's something I will never forget obviously. It's part of my journey."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"Fortunately, I've been around a few times, so it wasn't my first time. But it's always a blessing, especially for the older guys. You've got Steph, LeBron, KD. Those three in particular, those are Hall of Famers, top-tier guys. It's always a blessing to share the court. As long as you can, you treasure those moments. Hopefully I'm talked about in the same category as my career continues to move forward."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,This is actually going to be my first time in Chicago. I'm really excited. I've heard really good things about it. You have some of the best pizzas. I'm excited to get there.

2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I hadn't been shooting the three ball well all night, but when I needed them to go in, they definitely did. God was good. I just was honored to be in the moment. I definitely tried to go the reverse through the legs. I couldn't make it in the All-Star Game, but I made it in a real game. Kind of funny how I did that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be patient. You've got to be patient. They're not always going to do things that you like. Be patient because they're kids. I think that's the most important thing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think it's beautiful. I took a lot of risk. I left France when I was 17. So I did the last two years in Germany. I felt like it was a risk, and I believed in myself. I worked a lot and stayed confident."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think just my teammates and how much time we spent together. I think that's something I'll miss, all the memories and things like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in."
