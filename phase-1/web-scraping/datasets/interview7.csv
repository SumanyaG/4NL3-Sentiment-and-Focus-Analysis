2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LeBRON JAMES,"Sometimes that's all a kid has is hope, and that's okay. As long as you don't give that up. Don't ever give that up because it's always brighter on the other side, for sure."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,You saw what Ben started off with Rising Stars MVP. Won the Skills Challenge yesterday. There's been a lot of love and excitement through not only our city but our organization as well.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,We just want to carry that momentum through the second half of the season and make a playoff push.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Last time it was my birthday, I was in college, broke my wrist. Never thought I would be here. Knew that at that time that my wrist was broken. I knew I was going to go to the NBA, but never thought I'd have the success I'm having."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"As I reflect back, it's really special. I don't take this life for granted. Yeah, it's a dream come true for me."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I was just going to keep shooting until I missed. Having fun playing basketball. I didn't know how many minutes I was going to play, didn't know how my leg would feel. I felt good today, even after the one-leg dunk. So that's positive for me."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Obviously it wasn't high intensity at all. It feels good that I felt good, and hopefully I can continue that moving forward."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"But to answer your question, I think as professional athletes, we're human beings at the end of the day. I think what you put off surface level is different than -- we're all humans and we all have emotions and good days and bad days."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It's a dream come true. Every kid dreams and sees, like, Bron on billboard in Cleveland, and you dream one day it can be you. To see it come to life, I can't describe it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, for sure, it's on the rise. So many talented young guys, guys my age, guys older than us. We have a good crop of talent in Canada. As we continue to get more exposure, keep working, we'll keep going up."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Absolutely. The country means the world to me. It gave me an opportunity. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here. So fortunate to be from there. Kids all over the world just don't get the opportunity because of where they're born. I don't take that for granted."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"To kind of have the flag on my back, it's a special feeling."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I appreciate that, but Steve is still ahead of me. I'm going to try to catch him, but he's still ahead of me."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Whenever somebody says good things about you, it's a compliment. Obviously he was a heck of a basketball player, knows the game really well, and I appreciate it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,For sure. It's one of those things that I expected to happen as I got better as a basketball player and became more consistent. It comes with it. It's fun. It's stuff you dream about.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Not at all. Like I said, I've been dreaming about this, this moment, this point in my career. I know what comes with it. I embrace it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I think just the underdog mentality that the brand kind of has, that I have had my whole career. Our stories kind of align with that. Then just, I think we have the same vision for the future, Converse basketball, and the direction."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"The shot-making from the East was incredible. Hard to play defense when somebody is shooting 30-, 40-footers. Great display of shooting tonight. Like I said, record-setting points was pretty cool."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Good test for us. They're playing well lately, and they've got some new additions to their team, which is going to challenge us. It's a great game to start the second half of the season with."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Yeah. I feel like the league is always looking out for the fans and trying to keep their interest high. This All-Star Weekend has gone on for a long, long time, so to keep people engaged is tough to do."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,I think they're doing the best job that they can. People are always excited for All-Star Weekend. I think they do the best -- a great job of trying to keep everybody engaged all the time.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,I think everybody could take from that and learn. His story has been inspiring for the last 20 years.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Those are supreme athletes, and it's good we get to celebrate them on weekends like that. Pretty cool he gets to bring the All-Star MVP back to his hometown and back to his family."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"We don't talk about the strength of schedule. We respect every team regardless and try to focus on us as much as possible each night. It just about building our habits, getting better at what we've already established and pushing forward."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I think playing against some of the teams that's going to be there at the end of the season, it's going to be a great test before we head to the playoffs."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I think that's a balance you always try to figure out each and every game, maybe something different. I think, when he has the ball in his hands and he's controlling the game, Coach can ask him anything, for him to score or get his teammates involved. He's up and able to do anything coach asks him."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"His teammates love him. Fans love him. I'm excited to watch his career going forward because I know he's going to do some incredible things here in Indiana. But just for the game of basketball as a whole, you can tell he's one of those point guards that the next generation, kids in elementary school, middle school kids will be looking up to."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,It's cool he got his opportunity and got his franchise to kind of run on his own.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"It's always been that way with NBA, and since the social media era, you see more and more of that. I think guys in the past have stood up for what they believe in, social issues in the league, and that's given us the confidence to go out and do it as well in this generation."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,We're only doing what the greats have done before us. They set a great example when it comes to that. It's good we have such a huge platform to get a message out quick to anybody around the world.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I like East and West always. I like playing conference versus conference, the traditional way that I grew up on. Hopefully we go back to playing in our own jerseys too."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"Traditional way, the way that the picking teams, all that stuff, it doesn't matter. It's all about the product on the court and celebrating the best players in the league at that moment."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,I just love my job. I love getting up and doing what I do every day. It's just in my DNA at this point to just get at that hoop.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"I enjoy every part of it. There's stressful times, but I enjoy it too. Honestly, when I'm out of those stressful times, it's cool to look back and get better at both. I just love my job. I want to do it as long as I can."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,He's been doing it for his whole career. I know I got off to a head start. But you can stretch your imagination. I think Atlanta two years ago where I think he won -- like maybe two feet beyond the three-point line to win the game in that Elam ending thing. It's always fun to stretch the limits of where he could shoot. He's been doing it a long time.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"He's been to two All-Stars, and playoff experience and all that will come. The sky's the limit for him. You don't want to change who you are as you get deeper into your career."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"Extremely excited. 2019, I think it was, I got to go home to Charlotte and feel the love of my hometown. Kind of embraced that experience. I imagine it's going to be that plus a whole lot more. Hosted in the Bay, it will be the first time since 2000. So a lot to offer."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"The whole Bay has a lot to offer -- San Francisco, Chase Center, possibly some spotlights in Oakland and our history there and in that city as well. But I'm excited. Thankful to be a short drive."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"I think about it all the time, but the thought stops because you've got to get ready for the next game. There's a routine and a cycle that goes if you embrace it now. Eventually you'll get to the point where you'll wake up, and whatever your body's telling you, whatever your mind is telling you, it's time. But I don't think I'm anywhere close to that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"He had this phrase called ""tiki-taka"" he called it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,"I don't know. I'll be able to answer that question better when it's all said and done, because you're still passionate and inspired to win more championships. Individual accolades come from that mission, and that is my advice."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,STEPHEN CURRY,I'll be able to answer that when I'm done. No idea right now.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it was great. Overall the weekend, celebrating basketball and the legends around the game and stuff like that, celebrities. I think it was a good weekend overall."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"Definitely the snow. I think nobody planned for that. But I live in Boston, so I'm used to it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"It was cool. It was fine. Before, I think we were attempting to put a little more effort into it, but I'm not sure how successful that was."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"Hopefully as the years go on, it gets back to being what the fans want to see. But I think maybe it was a little bit more effort this time, I think. I don't know. You guys would be a better judge of that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, there were some discussions. There were definitely some. I'm not sure how successful that was, but there were definitely some discussions. I guess guys are trying to figure out how to do that at the same time as having fun, being safe, being injury free. I guess more solutions need to be had to figure that out."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"It was cool being on the same team as J.T. this time. It was pretty cool. We got the win, and we had fun. I think it's just another platform to continue to raise for yourself but also raise for the city of Boston, just represent. I think that's what we kind of look at it as. That's what we've become."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,No practice. We just kind of went in hoping we'd have a better result. Obviously it went better in my head and our heads for sure than it looked out there.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"We still had fun. I put my name in the hat. It was a little bit uncomfortable to participate in that contest, out of my comfort zone, but I wouldn't change anything. I went out there, tried to compete. Tried to bring some attention to it. Didn't go the way I expected, but that's a part of it sometimes."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"I wouldn't say proud of myself, but I wouldn't change anything. I would do it again, if I felt like I made that decision. It was a little out of my comfort zone, but I did want to do something. I feel like I'm in my athletic prime. I felt like I wanted to go out and participate at some point in my career, and I did that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"He stayed hot from Saturday night, the win that he had. You could tell he was going for it. All we had to do as a team was give him the ball, and he did what he does best Make a lot of threes. How many did he have? 10, 11? He totally deserved it. All he had to do was play hard and give it his everything."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's incredible. He was shooting a couple shots and they were going in, and he would see like the reaction of everybody, KD, Steph, KAT, Jokic, they were all looking like, and I'm like, dang, that's my teammate there. I'm happy that he's on my side, and I'm happy what he's capable of doing on the court."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"We've just got to stay healthy, keep enjoying the game. Keep on getting together, getting closer. Build good habits as a team in the last 26 games that we have, and hopefully when it matters most, we can gain some edge. He can make tough shots like that, and I can do the rest to try to help us win."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"To answer your question, it's nice to have him on our side."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I think by doing that step by step, I was able to -- people around the world know where Milwaukee is, and people talk about Milwaukee. Me being able to win a championship, in the last couple of years, we've been always competing for the championship. Obviously it takes a lot of hard work, a lot of time. But at the end of the day, it wasn't like my mindset being in Milwaukee, I wasn't thinking small-market team, small city, I've got to put them on the map, I've got to raise the whole thing."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"No, I always was, I've got to get better. I've got to represent them the right way when I put on that jersey. I've got to respect the people and respect the people before me, and hopefully I can make my mark. By having that mindset, I think I've been able to do it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy that I can spend a few down days with my family, getting my mind right, getting my body right. Getting in the gym and working out and getting ready for the game."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I think as a team, we all needed that. The last couple games we played before the break, you could see not only were we tired physically, but we played two back-to-backs in a row, four games in five days or four games in six days, I don't remember, but it's tiring."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Our shootarounds, our practice, we have to get closer as a team. It's always like we've got to catch up. Usually when you start off in training camp, you have game plan, the structure and you keep adding slowly, slowly, slowly. We don't have that luxury anymore. Every shootaround, instead of shooting around and messing around and getting ready for the game, we actually practice. And so now we're physically a little more tired than the other team."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Now we're adding things. We're adding more things. So I feel personally and our team, we need this little break, five, seven days, hoping to get back refreshed and go win some games."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"You cannot hope guys miss. The players are too good. Guys are making shots from half-court. You saw that today. Last All-Star Game before that, I think in Cleveland, I think Steph was doing the same thing. Even guys that are not as good at three-point shooting, they can still shoot the ball. You can't just hope. You have to make it tougher, contest."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"If you allow him and force him to take a tough two from the free throw line or a floater, it counts for two. I feel like that's been our philosophy the last couple years. That's our game plan. We still are going to allow a lot teams to shoot threes because they still play basketball. They play basketball. We play basketball. You cannot guard everything. But to be a good defensive you team, you have to make the other team shoot tough twos, and that's the way."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's fun. At the end of the day, we don't get as much time as we probably want to get with our family because of our profession. Our program is very, very busy, and whenever I can spend some time with my kids and kind of make them understand what I do, I try to take the time."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"But now I'm like, this is who we are. This is my family. I want my kids to be great men and understand what I do. I want them to have fun and see that their dad is having fun also. They enjoy basketball, and now I cannot keep them away from basketball."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"So I'm excited. I'm excited to be a father. I'm excited to make a future with my kids, and I hope that I can be a good father."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I'll say many times if you could like create the perfect brother, Thanasis would probably be the person. He always like looked after us, took care of us, be supportive of us. He's always been there for not just me, but all our brothers."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Back in the day, my brother Thanasis went viral with the Shammgod move. He basically shared shoes with me. He shared the Kobe five, Kobe six, something like that. It was the same colorway that I wore today, white and red. I loved them. Whenever he played, he'd take them off and then give them to me and allowed me to play. So we used to share our shoes."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Absolutely. My foundation is based in St. Louis. Obviously that's where I'm from. I'm very prideful about the city and community I grew up in and trying to impact and change those around me.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, the initiative will start in St. Louis, and hopefully as it continues to grow and we get bigger and get more resources, I would love to expand. As of right now, it just focuses on single-parent families in St. Louis at the moment."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"They have individual awards for a reason. As a competitor, as a player, you grew up watching your favorite players winning MVP and First Team All-NBA and all that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Of course you want to win those things. But you can't take precedent over playing the right way and doing the things that you have to do in order for your team to essentially be the best team in the league and have a chance to win a championship.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, it's been great. Couldn't be happier for him. You see the things that he did while he was at Duke. That's when I first got to know him and be able to talk to him. Obviously since he's been in the league, got a chance to meet his dad, his mom, signed with Jordan Brand, so obviously we have that connection as well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Just a great person, great kid, works extremely hard. Obviously only in the second year, and already an All-Star. So the work is there. The talent is there, for sure. I'm excited to see where he takes it. Couldn't be happier for him. This is only the beginning for him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I'm not caught off guard by making the All-Star Game. I'm still very grateful to be here and thankful to get that because it's not something you take for granted, right? Only 24 of us get to be here every year. There's 450, 500 players in the league. So that's a really big deal."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a special weekend. You've got the best players in the world. A lot of retired guys come around, and you get to see them. It's great for the fans. It's great for your family."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So that's kind of my favorite part about the weekend, just being able to bring my son, obviously, my mom, and seeing all the retired guys I grew up watching and spend time with them."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,All-Star weekend is great. Very honored to be here. Look forward to making many more.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"What makes it special is just the history of it. When I was your age, watching my favorite players compete and play in the All-Star Game and make highlights, it was a very special weekend for me to watch. I can only dream and imagine of one day being able to wear that jersey and live out my dream."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Five years ago, I made my first All-Star Game, and I've been fortunate enough to make it every single year. Just everything about All-Star weekend is special, and the game is super exciting. You get to play with guys that you're normally competing against. So that makes it different as well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"You just get to share the court with some of the greatest players to ever play, and it's just memories you'll have for the rest of your life."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Always just follow your heart, follow your dreams. Never let somebody tell you what you can or can't do. If people are not laughing at your dreams, you're probably not dreaming big enough. So reach for the moon."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I love watching him play. He's going to be incredible for a very long time. He's having a great year, and I'll continue to keep watching him do great things."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"If you get a tech for overreacting to a call that was deemed incorrect or whatever, you should get your money back."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Laughter.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"As well as all the younger guys. Whether it's guys my age or the guys a little bit older, with the Jokices and Giannis, or guys younger than me. So I think the league is in a great place. When LeBron retires, the face of the league, that's tough. But we win a championship, I've got something to say about it, I know that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,My mom. Easy answer. My mom raised me to be the young man that I am today. I give her all the credit for all my good qualities.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,Kobe. Kobe Bryant. That was my idol and the guy that inspired me to ultimately get to the point where I am today and strive to be the best version of myself.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Hot take, I probably won't score 55 points tomorrow. It's a feel thing. Starting in the game tomorrow, you get into a good rhythm, get a couple layups, maybe a couple threes, you look up, now you've got 16 points, and it's like, all right, I might try to go get it again."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I wonder who's the last person to win back-to-back All-Star Game MVPs? I'm not sure I know that. Russell Westbrook in 2015 and 2016. But if it's not going to be me, I might say -- maybe like Donovan Mitchell, maybe so. Someone from our team."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Just feel like he's athletic enough, obviously. I think a key part of it is starting, right? Probably going to play a little bit more than the rest of the guys. Is he starting? Wait, is he starting? Shoot, I might be wrong."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I had, like, 55 last year, and I think he was on my team. I want to say he might have had 40-something, so he was close. Mitchell scored 40 points. He's just somebody that can get really hot. In the All-Star Game, if you can get hot, have some electric dunks and things like that, you have a great shot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"No change. My goal is to play for USA until the wheels fall off. If I get that call to go, I'll be there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,I don't really get into that. That's something that you guys decide as media members.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I think we got a lot of different guys that it could be. The league is in great hands. It's the most talent that has even been in this league. There's a lot of different guys it could be. We'll see. To be the face of the league, winning has to come with that. Whatever young guy takes that charge and is winning moving forward, that's probably who it will be. Yeah, that's not for us to decide."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Well, I'm not on the team yet. If I were on the team, it would mean the world to me. Obviously I had a lot of fun with Team USA last year, and we didn't get the result we wanted. To be part of the team this year and have a chance at a little bit of revenge or a little bit of get-back, that would mean the world."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Going into the Skills contest, I have no idea what that entails. Looking forward to finding that out. I do think what we have over people is chemistry because we're all together all the time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"3-Point Contest, just don't choke. Last year I had a legendary first round, and then I think I got iced a little bit. That might be the reason. But I was terrible the second round. Just some consistency this year, and hopefully I can pull off the W."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"That's a good question. I'm going to say myself, number one, of course. Then I'd probably say Shai and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. I like their style, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"It's been a zoo. It's been a lot, but it's been a lot of fun. I've been told I'm kind of like the prom king of the weekend, so just doing whatever I'm asked to do."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Coolest thing I've done? That's a good question. The IndyCar was cool. I'm trying to think. I don't know. I don't know. I did the little 2K League thing yesterday and was with Tyrese Maxey and some other 2K League guys. That was fun because I've always grown up playing the game. There's a lot of YouTubers there that I grew up watching, so it was cool to see those guys for, sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Wow, that's a great question. I'm glad I get to plug I.Y. a little bit, give him some love. Me and I.Y. hit it off right when I was in Sac, and we grew our relationship there pretty quickly. Obviously I got traded here. He was able to join me here."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"We spent a lot of time together. This is his first time living outside of California, so there's a lot of trust that he's put into me and my future and this organization's future to move here. I'm excited that he's here, and we're very, very close."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Thankful he's in my life, and thankful that I have him, that I can call him a brother, but also someone whose basketball opinion I trust more than a lot of people."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Very critical. When I get compliments from him, it means a lot because I don't get them often. He's like my mom. Yeah, I'm always -- especially a play or if I mess up or somebody else messes up, I can quickly ask him to pull up the iPad and give me a look. You see a lot of times that I have the computer or something on the bench just showing guys just because he gets it to me pretty quickly."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I know our minds are usually on the same wavelength, so that helps a lot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I appreciate the love. It's super cool to be on Chinese social, interacting with fans. That means a lot to me. So I appreciate that. I feel like that has a lot to do with me being first in fan votes. I know people see a player in Indiana and don't expect that, but the love I've received from my fans in China has been amazing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,TYRESE HALIBURTON,"For sure. I'll be Chad. I'll be the sidekick. Me and Ant, if Disney wants to rock with us, we'd be down. We could do it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I think winning games speaks for itself. That's why everybody plays the game. That's why you watch the game. You want your teams to win. It's everybody's ultimate goal, and I think that obviously this year we've gotten off to a really good start in that category. I think winning games is the biggest."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I honestly try to stay very present, try to stay in the moment, not look too far ahead, not look back and kind of just take advantage of every moment, whether it's me working or it's me just being grateful for where I am today. I try to just stay in the moment, and it's worked out pretty good thus far. So I try to continue to do so."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"For me, it's not any more difficult. I think I've learned through experience -- and obviously as a young kid it's easy to get caught up in it, just going back to high school and rankings and things like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I've just found so much success from, not blocking it out, but not letting it faze me or control me. I think I've just learned through that experience and figure out what works for me and then try to run with it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"To this point, it's not any harder, because I've grown through it being hard, I think, in the past."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It's amazing. It's a good feeling, just seeing the thing develop, not only for myself, but for my peers and guys that I'm around all the time and guys that are like brothers to me, just because we do everything together. It's exciting. Not only for myself, like I said."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Good question. I'm not too sure. Usually experience, the teams that have gone through multiple playoff series and multiple guys that have gotten to that level know what it takes to get over the hump and do so. That's something that, honestly, just has to come with us playing in more games. Maybe we give it time. Maybe we don't."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"But our goal wasn't to be 37-17 halfway through the season. We want bigger things and better things. Obviously, we're not done. So, yeah, I think it's more of a message to ourselves."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"He's super, super humble, a great guy, first and foremost. Really down to earth, easy to talk to, easy to work with. Easy to get along with."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Then as far as on the court, he has an ability to -- he always understands what the right thing to say is. And the things that matter, he always emphasizes. When he speaks, guys listen and guys understand that it's something that is going to make or break our team."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I'm not too sure. I think no matter what there's like a fine line in -- like when it comes down to it, there's always a fine line in games played and availability. I think the league has the right intention in trying to make that line a little bit bolder and easier to make a decision."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Now, I try to be as available as I can every night, not only for that, but just for the love of the game. But as far as how the rule goes, I don't really have an opinion. I'm going to try to be available for my team to win basketball games every night. If I can't be available, then I just can't. It is what it is."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Work on your craft as much as possible. Pretty cliche. But I would say be a star in your role -- that's also a cliche. I think when guys figure out what their game is going to look like, what their roles are going to be, and then attack it with everything they've got, you find the most success. I'd say that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"When I see those high-scoring games, I just think about the skill that has come into the league and how great these players really are and how great offense is always going to beat great defense all the time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"You watch Luka's 70-point game, and he's making tough shot after tough shot. I definitely feel like someone can break that 80-point. 100 points would be tough to do in a game. You've got to make every shot and get a lot of shots up to get to 100. But I think somebody could get 80."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"I think each era has about six or seven guys that help carry the game forward, help push the game forward. It's more than just Steph and LeBron and myself. It's the James Hardens, Russell Westbrooks, Kawhi Leonards, Paul Georges, a lot of these guys who inspired the next generation of hoopers to want to be professionals. There's more than just one or two guys."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"You look around the league -- I'm going to miss a lot of guys, but you see Shai, Ant, Book, Luka, Tyrese Maxey, Tyrese Haliburton. There are so many guys inspiring the next generation of hoopers after them to become basketball players that you can't just pinpoint it to one or two guys."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"It's about pushing the game forward, setting a different standard, how we play. These guys are doing it right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"That's a tough question. You put me on the spot. If I had to say one, I would say probably Game 6, 2012 Western Conference Finals, up 3-2 against San Antonio. We were down 20 at the half at home, and we had to rally to get to the Finals. At 23 years old, that was probably something that stood out the most."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Because we hang out off the floor. I think that's most of the battle. When you get to know your teammates that deep, we almost to this point know what each other is thinking. I hung out with him a lot since I got to Phoenix and this past summer, and we worked out obviously."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Same thing. I feel like we're both confident players. But when you've got that extra support out there to just go do what you do, sometimes you need that, especially when you're one of the lead guys on the team. You focus on so much other stuff -- your teammates, scheme, strategies -- and sometimes you need somebody to relieve you of all that stuff and just go play, and that's what we do for one another."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Also, our coaching staff does that for us, as well, and our teammates. When you've got support like that, it just makes you a way better player."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,I doubt I have an album dropping. I just do it for fun.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"""Hi."" That's it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"I think I've had great chemistry with every point guard. I think, to be honest, I played longer with Russ, so I think I probably have more chemistry with him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"We came up together as 19-year-olds. We played eight seasons together, and he knew me inside-out. Obviously, I had great success with Steph. I don't want to discredit that. But I don't want to also discredit what me and Russ did, as well, as a duo."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Legacy, I just want to be respected amongst people that actually played the game, and players that are aspiring to be where I'm at, I want to be respected by them. And that's it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Some guys get injured, man. Some guys just get injured. I think the 65-game rule for the load management, but I think load management sometimes comes from these organizations too when they force you to sit out of games and guys may be injured. I don't know. It's tough. It's tough."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"I just want guys healthy and on the court too. I guess that's what the solution is, try to get guys to stay on the court. It's just something we've got to deal with. I won't say I love it or I hate it either, but it's just something we've got to deal with."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Every night my best player and my top fives and GOATs, I feel like every week they change. I feel like this last week right before the break Minnesota was playing good ball. Clippers playing great ball. If anything, I'd probably say Clippers and give it to Kawhi as the best player I've seen."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Yeah, I got asked this question three times over the last three weeks. My final answer today is I'll go with Steph."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,I just think the fact that you got the men's and women's game coming together to just help celebrate the game of basketball is always good. Sabrina is such a great ambassador for the women's game -- I don't even want to call it the women's game. For the game of basketball in general. Steph is such a great ambassador.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"So when we get them both on the floor together to shoot some basketballs, it's always going to be fun. I'm looking forward to it. It's a new event we have, and hopefully we can do more stuff like this with the WNBA, as well, and All-Star Weekend. So I'm sure they're going to put a show on."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"It's huge. It's huge. It's an opportunity for people around the country to see the type of talent they have at HBCUs. There's a lot of hidden gems there, great coaching, great talent up and down the board."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"If we can give them the platform to showcase their talents and skills, we need to do so. So I'm excited for them. Hopefully this becomes an annual thing and we start to see more and more talent come out of HBCUs."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Just a flat-out legend. For the Boomers, right? Boomers. He's been a constant for that program since I've been in the league."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"They play with such a toughness, and you know that comes from their best player, which is Patty. And then having an opportunity to play with Patty for two years in Brooklyn, I see why he's become such a legend over there. He's so passionate about where he's from. He's so passionate about just the culture itself and basketball. He's an extremely hard worker whose journey should be spoken about with some of the best."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,He continues to push the game forward and inspire a lot of people. That's what I love about this game.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Man, that dude can achieve anything he wants in this game. He's only getting more comfortable as time goes on. 20, 10, 3 12 blocks a game, 2 or 3 assists. It's just insane how dominant he's going to be as he gets more comfortable in the game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"We'd hope that this stage and being a first of its kind in basketball, kind of the competition, the road map that Sabrina has ahead of her as an ambassador for the game of basketball, not just women's basketball, but how she handles herself, and just the conversation around promoting the WNBA, the NBA, merging our two worlds, it's going to be fun."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"I don't know what's going to come out of it, but me and Sabrina talked about how cool of an opportunity it is to do something that's never been done before in our game. And for her to have a presence on this stage is going to do a lot to inspire the next generation of young boys and girls that want to compete and see themselves in either one of us."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"Wherever it goes from there, we know we can kind of plant our flag as doing something really special."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"You've got a lot of talent to choose from in that respect. I think the more you understand the authenticity around it, and like me and Bron and KD, like the guys you named, have done it and tried to do that in our way, where it might look different for different guys. But the league is in pretty good hands when it comes to young talent that I think gets it and understands the magnitude of the platform we all have and will respect it as they come into their own."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"It was a surprise, one. I didn't know Seth was on the trading block and whatnot up until probably two days before. The fact he had his homecoming going back to Charlotte, the first game they played, they wore their retro, old-school pinstripe Hornet jerseys, which my pops wore, and like you said, No. 30."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"It's funny, my dad said on the broadcast, I don't think anybody asked Seth or my dad what number he was going to wear. He just did it knowing it was an easy decision there. It was cool to see the Curry 30 alive back in Charlotte. Still got a lot of family there, and my dad obviously doing the color commentating for games. It's a family affair, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"They always told me that they were super high on me. But of course it's the NBA Draft, so you can't make any promises to anybody."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,It's something anyone has to manage in their career.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't. I did not envision this, not because I didn't think I was capable but because I didn't know. I think honestly until I was in maybe about ninth grade, my freshman year of high school, I had to learn the path that it took to get to the W. I was around it, but I didn't know the path that it took to get there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Basketball IQ, for sure. Making the right reads. Making smart plays. Being in the right position. I feel like that's very underrated, being in the right position and reading your defender. That's a lot of my game where I get my advantages from."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Our offense was bad at a time when we really needed it. Our pace was slow. Taking too long to get into things, and you know, I don't think we were terribly hard to play against from that standpoint. And that was obviously a difficult time to be doing that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Yeah, I mean, the dunking thing came late, first of all, so I didn't start dunking until my senior year in high school. That was probably part of it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"And then the second one, the same. It's when you want to be thinking about nothing else. It definitely sucks to miss."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Whenever Drake just wants to talk about life, I'm just there for him. And then he just gave me that title."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, he's having a great year. Unlike any other player we've probably ever seen. At this point, I think he, for sure, deserves to be in the conversation with some other great rookies out there. Chet Holmgren at OKC. I think those would probably be the two guys off the top of my head right now."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"It's crazy how the series ended. For four games, it was about the three ball, three ball, three ball. Certainly offensive rebounds throughout the whole thing. But then tonight came down to points in the paint. We don't even score in the paint and we had 44, was it, right. So it was really interesting how the series ended with them playing bigger. They won the game with their defense, no doubt about it, with their defense. Anyway, to your question, her minutes were really good, really helped them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Today throughout my whole day, everybody was texting me, like, ""How are you? Are you ready?"" All these things. ""Do your thing."""
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"That really helped keep things in perspective. I went out there to play to win and not to lose. The experience that I had, even though it wasn't the best experience and we lost in the past, it allowed me to be a little bit more relaxed in the situation and just understand that these moments aren't guarantees. It's not a given. You have to kind of just take advantage of it but also live in the moment and really appreciate what it took to get here, too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Hanging out, playing video games, going out, having a drink. All that stuff helps when you're trying to gain chemistry as a team. It's been great getting to know him."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I have no idea. It's a funny and a crazy story at the same time. I really don't expect everybody to know who I am or know my name. I'm not aiming for that. I'm actually aiming for the opposite, kind of stay as low profile as I can. Yeah, crazy, crazy story."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I'm very excited to work with her and just learn from her and take whatever I can take from her and take it to my game. I would say just being able to score in different ways, that's a way that I can come in and help the Liberty."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"Yeah, I think I can. It's just getting a lot of reps in practice and everything like that. Just getting the confidence and just let it go. That's what I'm going to try to do in Phoenix, is be in the gym a lot. Just do what I've got to do as a team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I mean, I'll let these guys talk about that. Go ahead, you guys. Jump in there."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Then in 2019 in Charlotte, I got exactly those shoes, and I wrote on the shoes, ""Thanks, Thanasis, for sharing."" And I kind of paid tribute to him for sharing the shoes with me ten years ago. He never thought I was going to be an All-Star or the person that I am today. He was just with me because he loves me. I love him, too, so I wanted to pay respect for him."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think overall it's just our lockers are next to each other's. When you go somewhere outside of your team with a teammate, you usually naturally turn to each other more, just a lot of conversation. We're sharing our own experience away from this when we get around other groups."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"After that, I had to start getting the between cross and start getting back in my bag, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,KEVIN DURANT,"Luckily I'm on my way out, so I won't have to deal with it too much. You just see him settling in game after game after game, and it's going to be a joy to watch."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't know. Like, you guys talk about the run, Sab's shot. There was so many players that came in that were like such an important piece of what we were able to do tonight just because they made Minny tired and that's what makes this team really special. It's a collective win even though some of us are shining a little bit brighter."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,I got hopes and dreams.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,Sometimes when we didn't rebound or we kind of -- we went to offensive rebound but we are out of position and they got easy layups in transition. So those really break your back.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, so obviously one of our focuses this year of our social justice council is reproductive rights, as well as civic engagement, given that we're in a general election year. So the one thing I like about our players, our players want to be engaged. They don't run away from things. They want to be engaged and they want to force change in the communities in which they live and work, and they do it very, very effectively. I think on this issue they'll continue to do that effectively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I did. I felt confident. Even with that last shot I felt confident, okay, because we worked hard and we found a way to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Finally, before we get to your questions, we have some news to announce Starting next year with the 2025 WNBA season, the WNBA Finals presented by YouTube TV will be a best-of-seven format, replacing the current best-of-five format. The Finals will take on a 2-2-1-1-1 structure, in which the team with the higher seed will host Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, and its opponent will host Games 3, 4 and 6. This will give our fans a championship series format that they are accustomed to seeing in other sports."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Just to show people what type of time I'm going to offer Utah for Saturday in the Dunk Contest. Didn't want to do anything too crazy. Didn't want to give any previews of what I'm going to do, but definitely wanted people to see I got a little ups."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Oh, Jabari Parker? I love it, man. I watch all of his highlights, and he's found a place that he's happy. I feel like, when I played with him, whenever he was happy and he felt comfortable in his environment, he will thrive, and you can see he's playing really well."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"You want to come here and have success, so I had that. It's just been a good break. Just being around my family, being able to just do the things that I've always done."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I like bowling and starting to pick up golf too. Have a lot more free time, so I can start getting good at golf and getting a routine for it. But definitely bowling is another activity I'm heavy on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, I thought as you said, we had the appropriate effort and focus on what we were doing. As the game wore on, the offense got harder and harder for us."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"One of the things that's great about being in the WNBA right now is everybody is paying attention. I ran into someone who ran an ad buy during the final of the women's Final Four. They said -- it was a CEO they got thousands of messages, not only about how great they thought the ad was but that they ran it during women's basketball, and how much that lifted their brand with not just their female employees but their female customers and everybody."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, that's what we said we worked for all season long. Minnesota did what they needed to do here to tie it up, and now we go back home. We love playing in front of our home crowd."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's hard. Like we are both competing for a championship. You have to play with a level of desperation from the very beginning, and so that's what we're going to need to do to come out in Game 3."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"You've just got to keep shooting the ball. I think, in a game like this, you know it's going to be pretty loose, and you're going to get your opportunities. Being in the starting lineup, I knew I'd play longer stretches, get more minutes."
