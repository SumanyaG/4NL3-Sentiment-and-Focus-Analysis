2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"We haven't played them yet, so it will be cool. We've got two games coming up against them the second half of the year. I'm excited about those two nights."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"I can confirm it's the guy you're looking at right now. Trying to apply some pressure, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"The first year we did the player draft -- the first year I was the captain up until the game in Chicago, it was the Elam Ending, that was kind of your peak competitive nature that kept everybody on the edge of their seat till the end. I think the guys had a different energy about them and definitely a spirit of competitiveness throughout the whole thing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"Then it kind of got a little quirky with all the draft stuff that was happening. We talked about it a little bit in some of our meetings. It's kind of hard when you're here in the building -- it's very prima donna of us, but you're here four or five hours leading up to the game. It's so different than our normal game day kind of experience, like the way we prepare our bodies and stuff like that. So it's kind of hard to get to a normal level."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"I think there's a balance. We've talked about it a little bit. It's just coming with the right energy where everybody knows kind of the speed of the game, physicality of the game, and you can kind of make those adjustments, whether you're starting, whether you're coming off the bench, playing a little bit of defense. And kind of taking it from there wherever the game goes."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"I think getting rid of the pre-draft thing where everybody was standing around for however long will help. The East-West stuff, where there's a little more familiarity with your teammates, will help. Like you said, it's not going to be a Game 7. It's not going to be a playoff-type vibe, but it should be somewhere in between."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"Like you said, talent is at an all-time high in every position. Shooting ability, scoring ability, different combinations that coaches are putting out there, like five-man units where everybody is a threat to shoot the ball. So the game has changed dramatically."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"I think there was that week or two-week span, there was a 70, a couple 60s and I don't know what. It was astronomical scoring. That slowed down a little bit."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"There's a couple rules, I think, from a defensive perspective -- I know Coach has talked about it a little bit -- where you could favor the defense a little more. I know the conversations the -- what's the group called that makes the rules? -- Competition Committee, thank you, that make those decisions every summer and try to adjust how the game is going, those conversations are always happening."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"I like the brand of basketball because everybody who is out there can put the ball on the floor, for the most part, can, like I said, be a threat to shoot. You're going to see a sway toward higher scoring, but I think the cycle of the league, it will reset itself at this point. I don't know how quickly that will happen or what rules will change this summer and the following summer, but I personally like the brand of basketball that's being played because it highlights the amount of talent that we have around the league."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"Gui is an unbelievable person. He's shown in some short stints out there on the court with us what he's capable of. He's got a bright future ahead of him, and I know he's proud to represent his country."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,"I've been to Brazil once, and it was way back when I was in high school. I told Gui, when I come back, I'm going to call him, call Varejao, call Barbosa and all the guys I've played with, and hopefully they treat me to a good time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,They're definitely proud to represent their country. Gui is the next in line to do that. It's been cool to watch him grow in the short time he's been with us.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,STEPHEN CURRY,He hasn't shared that with me as much yet.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"That time I drafted him, the relationship, I had a big relationship with him. I appreciate him as a player at the time, and I knew the value he brought to the game. It's a guy on the All-Star team that you want to have on your team. I think that's pretty much all."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Now having him as a teammate, I think it's unbelievable having the all-time great suiting up next to you and getting ready for the game. Our chemistry day by day is getting better and hopefully can get to a place that we can compete for the championship."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"We've been teammates for 50 games, so four, five months. Now, as I said, game by game, day by day, we're getting closer, chemistry is getting better. Hopefully we can get to a place that we can lead the other guys to the goal that we've set in the beginning of the year."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's always a great feeling. I never take it for granted, and I'm never going to let it slide by without appreciating it. From my first one until my last one."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I'm happy that I'm here. I'm happy that I get to suit up and play, participate in this game in the best place in the world. I'm happy that I'm able to put on a show for the people."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to come to practice. The plane was delayed. I know there's a lot of kids that come out to practice that don't have a chance to go to the game to watch us play. I don't know if the NBA is that complimentary anymore. They have you pay for it, I don't know. But first time I was at the All-Star, it was free."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"As I said, it's great to be here. I appreciate every moment of it. I appreciate that I'm able to put on a show here for the people in Indiana and for the people around the world that are watching. Suiting up with the best players in the world in the locker room, you get memories, great memories, from conversations that I remember that I had, with Carmelo, my first one, and conversations I'm going to have tomorrow with Dame, Tyrese, Brunson -- all these players that I don't always have the opportunity to sit in the same locker room with."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"But it's fun. Every one that I was able to participate was fun, except for last year when I wasn't able to play."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Oh, yeah, that's my dad. Growing up, I remember it was a game that the best players played. I think my first memories of the All-Star was in the video game. Now it's the NBA 2K is big. But back then from where I'm from the NBA Live is a different version. I believe in the 2006 version Manu Ginobili was doing well. I remember they were playing East versus West, and I used to compete with my brother in the video game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,That was my first memory. I thought all the best players coming to a game and they play against one another and it's fun.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Then you participate in some of them, and it's been a fun ride. I enjoy it. I hope the people that watch the game enjoy it as much as we enjoy it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I don't know. We have Victor. We have Nikola, but he doesn't want to be really the face either. We have Luka, Joel, Shai, on and off the court. There's a lot of people that can take his place after LeBron leaves."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,His availability. 21 years he never got hurt. I think that's the biggest talent he has. He's able to be durable throughout his whole career. There's never been a player like that.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I wish that I could be as durable as LeBron. That's the most important thing. All of the other things you can control, from being able to shoot better, be able to post up better, be able to dribble better, be able to run the floor better, all the other things you can control."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"The things that you can't control is how durable this guy has been, how the way he takes care of his body. A lot of people work hard, but there's only a few of the players that recover as hard, too, as LeBron. So probably that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's fun. It's always fun playing against the best players. Now, if we are going to be in the Finals, I don't know, time will tell. Denver has a very, very good team, probably the favorite in the West, probably going to make it all the way. But we have a lot of work to do, talking about our team. We have a lot of work to do."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"But it's always great playing against Nikola, playing against the best players in the world. It's always fun."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,He had this crazy buzzer beater a couple weeks ago. He's leaned out. He's healthy. I'm just happy that he's enjoying the game again. Barcelona definitely have a good one -- good one. A great one.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Great guy also.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I'm happy. I'm happy to see him out there. I'm very, very happy to see him out there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I'll be honest with you. I don't watch basketball. I didn't watch any game of Wemby before that, and I didn't watch any game of Wemby after that. Not just Wemby, but in general, I don't watch basketball. Stats, highlights, how people play, I have no idea."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"And I love it. I love when I go to the game, and I have no idea who I'm playing and what they do. It makes it harder."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,I really don't want to go there. Just never give up. Keep on believing. Keep on going. And be a hard worker. That's all I can say.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I don't give up. I believe in myself. I believe in my dreams and what I'm trying to accomplish, and I know that I've got to work hard. That's what I've done my whole career, and that's what I'm going to do in basketball after I retire. It's something that's allowed me to be the man that I am today."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I hope it can touch as many people as possible, inspire them in the best way. But for me, I'm just -- when I'm doing stuff like that, I try to be myself. I don't have in mind I'm trying to inspire. I just try to be myself. I try to be as authentic as possible."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I understand that I have a platform that allows me to do that, and I have to be a role model for a lot of people around the world that look up to me. I try to be myself as much as possible. I was inspired by many people before me, and I hope that I can do the same for them. Not just for immigrants, but for a lot of people around the world."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be patient. You've got to be patient. They're not always going to do things that you like. Be patient because they're kids. I think that's the most important thing.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's hard. It's hard. This is my fourth coach in the span of six months, from Coach Bud, Coach Griff, Coach Joe and then Doc. Different philosophy, different game plan. It's hard. It's training."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I am a student of the game. I try to -- when somebody asks me to do something, I try to do it in the best of my ability. I try to understand what we're trying to accomplish because, if I can understand it, I can also be there for my teammates if they ask me a question."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"But I love working with Coach Doc. He's been very, very successful. We can talk all day about things he's accomplished around the league. He's won, I think, 1,100 NBA games. Some people have never played 1,100 games."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yeah, he brings that level of -- how can I say? A championship level to the team. He won. He's coached a lot of successful teams in the past. When you have that guy in your bench, you have to bring your A game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Now, things that we have to do to get back on track, I'd say, one, we have to get healthy, but that cannot be our excuse. We've played 56 games, which is a lot. We've played a lot of minutes. We've got to take care of our body, and hopefully we'll have a mental and a physical break now these six, seven days. Then we get back, and we are fresh, and we're able to go again and try to build new habits and play good basketball and try to win some games."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yes, it's been a very, very, very hard season for everybody. Not just for the players, but for the coaching staff, and changes -- it's been a hard season. But through it all, I think we can get it done. We hope. We'll see."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be a hundred times better than Giannis. He doesn't need to be Giannis. He's going to be Victor.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, it's been -- I mean, the schedule has been full, but it's also what I'm here for. It's a lot of fun experiences."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I'm looking forward to play in the game, two games hopefully. Next year hopefully the big game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"The Tech Summit, that was a lot of fun. It was funny. Had the rehearsal yesterday too. Actually learned a lot from these people who made the Internet world what it was today. It was a lot of -- I learned a lot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, about not skipping steps, I've been told never to skip steps my whole life, but that didn't stop me from running up the stairs. So yeah, of course it's something I want to be a part of in the future."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, I think so, especially if we win."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Expectations, it depends from who. My coaches and my teammates, the rise of expectations has been going on all season. It's no reason that it changes. So it's something I hope will continue as well with the years coming because I don't want to -- we want to be in the playoffs soon, and then we want to win."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Of course, not even talking about the statistical facts. He was just incredible."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"""Welcome to the NBA"" moment, there's been plenty of them. The earliest one I can remember is Kevin Durant was pretty tough to guard. Even though sometimes it feels like you've done your best and he still scores. So, yeah, there's been plenty of those."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"How different? The talent is just so incredible here, every team. So it's tough to guard because -- yeah, it's tough to guard. Yeah, those shots you've got to take are different as well offensively, the positions. Yeah, it's way different."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yes, how everything's getting better in terms of knowledge, the body, treatment, stuff like this, I think we're going to see more and more of those. Taking care of my body has long been one of my most important thoughts even for long term."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"But only the future will tell how the health is going to be. For sure, I'm trying to have no regrets about how I treat my body."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Cool, obviously. It was cool. Fun experience. Got to have a little fun with the guys, play against my teammates. So, always can appreciate moments like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Then, too, just continued to work over the summer to get more athletic each and every year. That's probably what it is."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Always. That was always my motto. Just be patient and be myself and continue to work hard every single day. That's the best way to do it because if you don't, you try to rush the process, things aren't going to go your way."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Obviously health is an issue, but without that being an excuse, we just have to play together, play the right way and defend at a high level. That's the best way to do it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,BONES HYLAND,"A little bit. I didn't get all the way suited up, but almost there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,BONES HYLAND,"I feel like what I offer is very elite. My shotmaking ability, my playmaking ability, my speed, my pace, my quickness. I feel like that's definitely a go-ahead position for me right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,BONES HYLAND,"I feel like I'm bigger than that, but in the meantime just go with what I've got right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,BONES HYLAND,"I feel like it's good. A lot of good guys around the team. A lot of good vibes, positive vibes. Just great dudes all around."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,BONES HYLAND,"It feels good to see the guys like that be back around at All-Star Weekend. Get out there and play with them and stuff like that because, honestly, we don't see each other a lot during the season. So just to be out there and be able to compete against each other and have some fun is good."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,BONES HYLAND,"Of course. Yeah, just try to blend in, but at the same time just getting in where I fit in right now and just trying to be that spark plug for us and get out there and do what I do best."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,BONES HYLAND,"I knew guys on the team before, but I didn't know I was going. Once I got traded there, it was definitely, like, a lot of excitement for myself. I knew a lot of guys on the team already. I just feel like I could fit in really well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's got to be MJ, I guess. I mean, he was the best."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,I wasn't ready for these questions.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, probably would help with a WWE match."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I'd say we surprised people who weren't paying close attention. Obviously we're in a small market and everything, so we don't have the constant daily national media attention that some teams have around them. But the diehard fans who really watch us could see the talent that we've had for the last couple years."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"First of all, it's a blessing to be here. I'm completely grateful. I don't take any of it for granted, especially knowing it can be taken away at any time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"What's really respected in this league is winning. It doesn't matter what you do, if you never win at the same time. That's always on the forefront of my mind."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"With the group of guys we've got, if anybody is not focused on winning, it's kind of an outlier in our locker room. I'm not going to be that guy who is kind of pulling away from what we're trying to do. It's showing in the win column. We know we've got a long ways to go."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,It's always good to be able to look back on what we've done so far in the season with kind of a natural break we're having with All-Star break. But there's still been a lot of lessons that we've still got to learn from.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I don't know, I just always show up early to things, I guess. Part of it's also like I'm young, and I didn't grow up in L.A. When you're driving out there, you've kind of got to take into account there might be two hours of traffic. So just in case, I always leave a lot of room there just in case."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"That was a big emphasis this summer, figuring out how to get my shot back to where it had been in the past and even better. That was a big part of it. I got to work on my shot kind of from the ground up, and when I got back to OKC, I kind of just continued that work all the way up to this point."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"He's a high-level competitor. You can see that in how hard he plays and the emotion that he plays with. He's a really good basketball player, too, so it's always fun to go up against players that are not only really good but play really hard. It really brings the best out of you."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"Always. Like I just said, it's always great to play against players that are really good and also play hard and have a lot of talent. It brings the best out of you and makes you better and really makes you compete."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I'm excited to play against him, but also all the other guys that are in this Rising Stars thing. There's a lot of talent across the board."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I think it's always been an exhibition. If you really go back and watch some of those highlights, there's not a whole lot of defense until the fourth quarter in those ones. But it just comes down to competing. I think last year there was some great moments between, I think Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown where they're going back and forth with each other, just competing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's friendly. At the end of the day, obviously nobody wants to have anything bad happen in terms of injuries or anything during the All-Star Game. But I think it just comes down to competing and having fun with it at the same time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"A lot of guys are friends with each other from being in the league and seeing each other all over the place, growing up playing basketball. If guys have a little friendly competition and go back and forth, I think that would be great for the game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I guess dominance and stats. Yeah, put up a lot of stats."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,I'd say my post fade. I added it to my game a while back. I've had it in my game. It's a good shot for me. I feel like I should just get to it more.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,I was on defense? I'd probably say like Embiid.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"And then ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, I mean, there's been a lot of good moments and a lot of bad moments this year, just like for anybody in the NBA. But I'd probably say Andre Drummond stripping me and making me fall on the same play. First game in the league, too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"First, I feel like I'm coming along great. Physically I've been blessed with enough luck, and I've worked hard enough to play in all 54 games so far this year. Obviously, last year I missed all 82 with kind of, I guess you could say a freak injury. I put a lot of work into my body and making sure that I'm in the right shape and strong enough, et cetera, to kind of deal with the night in, night out banging of the NBA."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I feel like I've done a great job of that so far. Shout-out to our medical staff, too, for helping me in between games, get ready for the next one."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"God willing, it would be great to play in all 82 games this year. That's definitely one of my goals this year is to play in every single game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"""I can't believe I just did this."" I mean, getting into the NBA, being drafted, shaking Adam Silver's hand and finally playing in my first game. Obviously, there was a lot of time in between that, but those two moments were huge for me."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I also understood that's just the beginning. Got a long ways to go from there, a lot of work to put in, but it's a good stepping stone along the way, I guess."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,I wasn't ready for these questions.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"Laughter. Probably like Embiid or somebody, just because he's huge."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, probably would help with a WWE match."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I'd say we surprised people who weren't paying close attention. Obviously we're in a small market and everything, so we don't have the constant daily national media attention that some teams have around them. But the diehard fans who really watch us could see the talent that we've had for the last couple years."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"First of all, it's a blessing to be here. I'm completely grateful. I don't take any of it for granted, especially knowing it can be taken away at any time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"What's really respected in this league is winning. It doesn't matter what you do, if you never win at the same time. That's always on the forefront of my mind."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"With the group of guys we've got, if anybody is not focused on winning, it's kind of an outlier in our locker room. I'm not going to be that guy who is kind of pulling away from what we're trying to do. It's showing in the win column. We know we've got a long ways to go."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,It's always good to be able to look back on what we've done so far in the season with kind of a natural break we're having with All-Star break. But there's still been a lot of lessons that we've still got to learn from.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I don't know, I just always show up early to things, I guess. Part of it's also like I'm young, and I didn't grow up in L.A. When you're driving out there, you've kind of got to take into account there might be two hours of traffic. So just in case, I always leave a lot of room there just in case."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"That was a big emphasis this summer, figuring out how to get my shot back to where it had been in the past and even better. That was a big part of it. I got to work on my shot kind of from the ground up, and when I got back to OKC, I kind of just continued that work all the way up to this point."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"He's a high-level competitor. You can see that in how hard he plays and the emotion that he plays with. He's a really good basketball player, too, so it's always fun to go up against players that are not only really good but play really hard. It really brings the best out of you."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"Always. Like I just said, it's always great to play against players that are really good and also play hard and have a lot of talent. It brings the best out of you and makes you better and really makes you compete."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I'm excited to play against him, but also all the other guys that are in this Rising Stars thing. There's a lot of talent across the board."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I think it's always been an exhibition. If you really go back and watch some of those highlights, there's not a whole lot of defense until the fourth quarter in those ones. But it just comes down to competing. I think last year there was some great moments between, I think Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown where they're going back and forth with each other, just competing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's friendly. At the end of the day, obviously nobody wants to have anything bad happen in terms of injuries or anything during the All-Star Game. But I think it just comes down to competing and having fun with it at the same time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"A lot of guys are friends with each other from being in the league and seeing each other all over the place, growing up playing basketball. If guys have a little friendly competition and go back and forth, I think that would be great for the game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I guess dominance and stats. Yeah, put up a lot of stats."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,I was on defense? I'd probably say like Embiid.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"And then ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, I mean, there's been a lot of good moments and a lot of bad moments this year, just like for anybody in the NBA. But I'd probably say Andre Drummond stripping me and making me fall on the same play. First game in the league, too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"First, I feel like I'm coming along great. Physically I've been blessed with enough luck, and I've worked hard enough to play in all 54 games so far this year. Obviously, last year I missed all 82 with kind of, I guess you could say a freak injury. I put a lot of work into my body and making sure that I'm in the right shape and strong enough, et cetera, to kind of deal with the night in, night out banging of the NBA."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"God willing, it would be great to play in all 82 games this year. That's definitely one of my goals this year is to play in every single game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"I also understood that's just the beginning. Got a long ways to go from there, a lot of work to put in, but it's a good stepping stone along the way, I guess."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,SCOTTIE BARNES,"It feels amazing to be a champion. We put in the hard work, the effort, and we were just playing hard both games, and we came together as a group, and we won out there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,SCOTTIE BARNES,"Everybody played hard. Jose, my boy, he played hard. Everybody just played hard really. That's why we won. We just tried to stick to that mindset, and that's why we came out with the W."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,SCOTTIE BARNES,"It's been amazing. Of course, I knew a lot more guys last year, but it was fun getting to know new guys, seeing the young talent that's under me. I'm only in my second year, but I'm seeing those first-year guys, and they're really good. They're really talented. So, it's been fun."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,SCOTTIE BARNES,"For sure. I feel like I always have that inspiration, that motivation to try to come back as an All-Star. It's one of my goals, and I'm going to keep fighting every year for it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"My ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, I think was my first game. We played in Detroit. First regular-season game, in Detroit. I had a fast break and dunked over the top of a guy, and it was kind of a surreal moment."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"It's exciting. Like you said, just having all these games after the break really mean something, every game. We've got to be ready to go because we're trying to make this final push."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"The break, just everyone getting a chance to take a breath and get whatever it is they need, whether it's rest, time with their friends and family. It's a great time to just take that time. So I look forward to getting back and making that push at the end."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Some, for sure, have just said little gems to me throughout the season, told me I'm playing well and they love what I'm doing, stuff like that. Then once I did make the All-Star, guys definitely went out of their way to tell me congratulations, which is dope because not even really knowing the guys, just them coming up and saying congrats, it's just a brotherhood in the NBA, and I appreciate it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Yeah, working out with him just showed me how to be even more efficient as a scorer. Like you said, a lot of pivots. A lot of movement without dribbling. When you catch, getting your defender off balance. Just being able to simplify the game and getting to your spots, that was one of the major takeaways I had from working out with him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"It wasn't seven, eight dribbles. There was never anything like that. It was simple three-, four-dribble combos, pump fakes, pivots, turnarounds, all stuff to be able to rise over the top and make the game a lot more simple."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"It was great. We got to go there early in the year. The fanfare was crazy. I didn't know what to expect, but sold-out game. The media at practice was crazy. You could just tell how excited they were for us to be there playing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"As far as the game, the game was super fun, super energetic. The crowd was into it. Every play that was made, they were reacting. It was a really fun game to be a part of."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,On the team right now? That's a good question. I like some of the guys they got this year. Some guys have been playing well.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I think Jared McCain has been playing pretty well. I think Kyle Filipowski has a chance. He's been playing well. Yeah, it depends who comes out of the draft, but I'm always watching them, cheering them on. I like some of their players, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,Shout-out my guy Jeremy Roach too.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Coming into this season, I had just played in the World Cup. When we got done, I think it was like two or three weeks into training camp, so usually that's like when you get built up and ramped up to get in the training camp. Me, it was the opposite. I didn't touch a ball after that for two weeks. So I came to training camp just body like I've been sitting down, not really into it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"So I had to kind of ramp up through the training camp, through the preseason, and that can take from two weeks to maybe a month. To start the year, I was kind out of rhythm, and I was kind of playing. I was kind of having trouble fitting back in, I think to our team, after playing so long with the guys."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I think I also just -- the role I was playing for USA, I wouldn't say it clouded how I played the first four games, but I had to get back to who I really was, having the ball in my hands, being that guy."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I'm not going to sit here and say I'm a point guard, but I definitely think I can handle the ball, initiate a lot of things, create plays. I think I'm growing a lot as a playmaker, being able to set up my teammates. That's something I take pride in, being able to play whatever position is needed."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Obviously, I know how my size is an advantage. So I don't want to get too much into staying on the perimeter. I want to be able to mix it up and always keep the defense off balance. That's something that I think me, my coaches, we always try to balance and work on is how much I'm handling, how much I'm inside and just trying to find that perfect balance."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I wouldn't say it's over, but I think it's just changing. I think it's more of -- really it varies from team to team, system to system, how guys fit, what the team's running, how they use a certain player."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I think like with Victor, I think I saw like a difference in his stats from playing power forward and center. So like when you're out on the perimeter, like I said, with my size, I don't want to be on the perimeter too much because then you become inefficient or taking bad shots. So you want to stay kind of around the rim, but also you want to be able to use your versatility to keep the defense off balance and make plays from the perimeter."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Just finding that for me has been a challenge, just since coming into the league, because I think, when I first came in, I kind of just wanted the ball and wanted to dribble around and see what I can do. Now in year 2, I've been a lot more intentional with how I get to my spots, how I'm being used and where I'm trying to get to on the floor."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Even if I do have it as a handler, I'm still trying to get to this spot on the floor. So that's been a big learning curve for me."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Definitely the grind of the season with all the travel and the games, and the competition level doesn't drop off. Every game is a high-level game. You're playing against the best players in the world."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"So it's definitely grueling when you are playing all these games against the best players in the world. You have to be strong, and not just physically but also mentally. There's a lot on your mind too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,So it's definitely something I've been learning and just trying to manage as the season goes on.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Everything. Everything. Literally everything. So definitely going to finish out the season strong and then take a nice break. Definitely look back at this year, and I can set some main focus points to work on over the offseason and just grind those out to become a much better player."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I think that's what we're starting to realize. I think that's why we've been able to put together the last two, three months of basketball that we have."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"It definitely was tough for me and I think the whole team. A lot of those games, we weren't getting blown out as well. We were still competing. We were down a lot of players because of injuries, and we just had to fight it out. A lot of those games were losses, so it was tough just racking those up."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"But we knew that once we got healthy, we were going to be much better, and that's been the case. So it's definitely encouraging."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Considering the circumstances of the injuries and what we went through as a team, I think we were able to fight through it. We started off 5-20. I don't know what our record is since then, but I'm pretty sure it's a winning record. So it just shows how much we came together and bought into what we were trying to do."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"It's just the guys we have in the locker room. I think we just all get along. We all want to see each other win. Nobody is out there with a personal agenda. Everyone is just trying to do what's best for the team. And I think when we have guys with that mindset and everybody is talented like we are, it results in wins."
