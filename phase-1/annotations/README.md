The dataset is taken from asapsports.com, with the data focusing on responses given by the interviewees.

The data was collected by scraping interview transcripts from ASAP Sports, a website that provides official press conference transcripts for major sports events, including the NBA and WNBA Drafts and Finals. The [scraping_script.py](https://github.com/SumanyaG/4NL3-Sentiment-and-Focus-Analysis/blob/main/phase-1/web-scraping/scraping_script.py) program given, a list of event URLs, scrapes the event data for each URL. These pages contain links to interviews conducted for each event. The scraper navigates through these pages, extracts the URLs of individual interviews, and then parses their content.

For each interview, the script retrieves the event name and date from the webpage's title. The interview text is then processed to distinguish between speakers and their statements. The script identifies questions and removes them to focus on direct quotes from players, coaches, and other any other interviewees. Since some names in the transcripts may not be properly formatted, the script includes logic to validate and clean speaker names, ensuring consistency. Additionally, a function corrects encoding errors that sometimes occur in text extracted from web sources.

Once the data is collected, it is stored in the [interviews.csv](https://github.com/SumanyaG/4NL3-Sentiment-and-Focus-Analysis/blob/main/phase-1/web-scraping/interviews.csv) file containing four key fields: event name, date, speaker, and quote. This structured format makes it easy to analyze the dataset. Afterwards, the [data_splitting.py](https://github.com/SumanyaG/4NL3-Sentiment-and-Focus-Analysis/blob/main/phase-1/web-scraping/data_splitting.py) program further processes the data by splitting it into eight datasets with overlapping segments which can be found in the [datasets](https://github.com/SumanyaG/4NL3-Sentiment-and-Focus-Analysis/tree/main/phase-1/web-scraping/datasets) folder.

To achieve the overlapping split, data_splitting.py first calculates a base size for each dataset and uses that to determine the overlap size (15% of the base size). It then randomly selects a subset of the original datapoints to be part of the overlap group and distributes the rest among the first 7 datasets. This allows for some redundancy across sets, which can be useful for validation and to determine the annotator agreement.

Overall, the data collection process ensures that structured interview data is extracted from ASAP Sports, cleaned for accuracy, and efficiently organized into manageable subsets. After this, the 8 dataset files are manually edited to add 4 additional columns to each file - one corresponding to each of the 4 labels (2 for each class). This is done in Microsoft Excel and the files are then 
downloaded and stored in the [annotations](https://github.com/SumanyaG/4NL3-Sentiment-and-Focus-Analysis/tree/main/phase-1/annotations) folder, ready to be annotated.

For the purpose of this assignment, the events used to generate daatpoints include the 2024 WNBA Draft, 2024 WNBA Finals, 2024 NBA Draft, 2024 NBA All Star Game, 2024 All Star Media Day and 2024 All Star Rising Stars Practice.
