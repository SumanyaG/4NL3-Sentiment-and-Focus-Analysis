2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I've said Philly is on the list, and Philly is on the list. Now that we have the three teams, two in '26, one next year, we're not in a huge rush. We'd like to bring it in in '27 or no later than '28, as I mentioned. So I'd say there's 10 to 12 cities that are very viable that we're evaluating, and we have a process. I'd say I don't have a deadline by which we have to name it because it'll be out to '27 or '28, but I would think in the next couple months or so we'll start -- now as we get into the offseason, we'll start taking a look at those that will go to the top of the list through our process.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, it's all the same types of things I've been talking about for the other three around arena, practice facility, player experience, committed long-term ownership group, city, demographics, psychographics, Fortune 500 companies based there. All the things we've been looking at in all of our cities and our data analysis. And then we've built some good relationships with some of the potential cities as they've started to engage with the league on an expansion team.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think if you look at the diversity of when we did our capital raise, you'll see a fair amount of diversity in the ownership group we brought in there, investor group.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, we talk with our owners all the time about diversity in the coaching ranks, in their front office, back office, et cetera. You see every year we score very well in our report on that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We have a lot of assistant coaches that have been previous WNBA players and represent a very diverse group, as well. We have all of our owners partnering with minority-owned businesses. We partner at the league with Mielle, who is one of our newer partners. Playa Society. I think one of our teams just got a Partake Foods jersey patch that's a minority-owned business.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But it's something that you can never rest on, so I appreciate the question. We've had a couple coaches exit, so I think we have three open coaching spots. Obviously, the Golden State Valkyries announced their first head coach in their franchise history today. We have three open coaching spots. So we'll certainly be looking for our owners to have a diverse pool of candidates, and ultimately they'll make the decision on their head coaches.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"We just take it on the chin, you know. We were up a lot and then we had a wild kind of sequence to end the fourth. Didn't start overtime great. I had a great look at the end and I didn't make it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"But I think that this is a series. We wanted to really win, obviously, for home court. But the beauty is, we have another game on Sunday and we'll be ready.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think we forced some of the action. We weren't moving it good enough. We couldn't get downhill as much. You know, we missed a lot of shots. We missed a lot of shots.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Just the principles of play for us. How we want to play, get to the next action.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, defensively, I think they executed better than us. That's what it came down to. They executed better than us. They found a way to win. They made some big shots, timely shots when they needed to.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,We're disappointed. We have to be better. We're a better team than what we showed today.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think it's pretty clear, JJ had an amazing game, and the way that she was aggressive from start to finish is exactly what we need.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we got a lot of looks. Like, 90 shots is a lot, and we missed them. I think just coming out and understanding the game plan a little bit better, and always being on our front foot. I felt like there was just a few situations, time and score toward the end of the game, that really hurt us. But collectively there's a lot of things that you could kind of look at and be like, well, this is one of the reasons why we lost.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And they made plays. They made plays down the other end. Obviously we contested it -- we give them a three, a four-point play. Those things, they can break your back, and they did. We had our opportunities to win and we didn't finish it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We're disappointed. We have to go back to work. We have to freshen up. We have to look at how we can be better, and it's really just principles of play. Things that we have been great at all season long, we have to just refocus on them.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think the missed free throw because we had an opportunity to go up one. But even still, at the end of overtime, I had probably one of my cleanest looks. Didn't make it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"I mean, they switched with us a little bit more to stop us from going downhill. I don't know, I think the weight of the game was more about us, like Sandy said, getting away from our principles versus what they did to kind of get us out of rhythm.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We had a tough night. We had a tough shooting night. We all did. But what I know, Sabrina is a competitor. She'll get ready for Game 2 and come back strong.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"It was a point of emphasis for us coming into the game, just to control the rebounding and really get on the boards and try to exploit them in that way. It's something that we're going to have to continue to do to be successful.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"But like Stewie and Coach said, we had a lot of opportunities to close the game out. A few things that we have to change and kind of be aware of moving forward, but still some things to build upon and things to learn from.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, a hundred percent. It's principles of plays at both ends. Being at the point of the screen, Kayla McBride is coming off and shooting it, and then letting them go downhill, pressuring and letting Hiedeman dribble by us and giving them too many easy looks where we should have been just a little bit smarter in our defense there.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Principles of play in the half court. Pace is there, but I think we got a little stagnant and a little tired. But credit to them. They were blowing us up and they were being really physical. They were very active. They were switching it, and then that took us out of it a little bit. We've got to be better and we will be better.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think it's, specifically to that play because they were reviewing the time, you're just focusing on making the shot. Making the first one. Making the first one. Making the first one.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,I think just the start we did have. We put up 32 points. We were very intentional playing defense. We were making it really hard for them to score. Some easy baskets. We were making shots and moving the ball really quick.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,But they went to another level. So they kind of took us out of a rhythm. Not surprised us. We knew what they are capable of doing. But we've got to get back and just play Liberty basketball.,,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely a little bit anxious. A little bit nervousness in there, just because I had no idea where I was going. I kind of told my agent to keep it a secret from me. I just want to be surprised.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"For me, I just wanted to land somewhere that would develop me and kind of make me into the best basketball that I can be. I'm happy that I landed with Utah. Definitely excited. Felt relief when I heard my name called, so that's probably the biggest one.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think the biggest way I fit in is just my versatility. When you come in at such a young age, and being able to play multiple positions and guard multiple positions, I really feel like that allows you to fit in with the dynamic of the team just because you can do so much and fit in with different needs. That's the biggest part.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,There's a lot of talented guys on that team. I could go down the list and do their whole lineup that I can fit in with. But the biggest thing is they are young and I could develop and learn with them and kind of build that young core. That's probably the part I'm most excited about with this team.,,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Just being himself really. I feel like that's how he differentiates himself on and off the court and really made a name for himself. Being himself includes not only his personality but also his work ethic and how hard he worked to get to where he is and where he is going to continue to go to.,,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I feel like just taking those aspects of his game and his mentality, how he approached every workout, every rep, every charity event, every media coverage, I feel like I can use that and take that with me and use it throughout my career. That's how I'm going to grow and develop.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"It's something we dreamed about. As kids, obviously we never really got to play against or with each other on the same team just because of the age difference. So I think being able to do that now is definitely a dream come true. I'm going to make sure I'm matched up on him when we're playing them. Make sure, tell Will, put me on Jalen Williams. That's the game plan.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think it just goes to show the type of parents I have and the type of people I have in my life and my family members, just the values they installed in both of us. That's why we ended up this way. So I know they are extremely proud watching us reach our dreams. That's the biggest thing for them.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"We practiced it a lot, I'm not going to lie. Two years ago, we messed it up. We were practicing for a few days, maybe even a week up until this point, to make sure we nailed it. Add a little flair to it. So we made up for it.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I've just got baby steps into the fashion industry, I'm not going to lie to you. This is the first time I stepped out and wore something expensive. I think for me it might be something a little hobby I'll pick up, but I'm just starting to get into fashion and just starting to figure it out. I'll probably learn from him as I go.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, it's hard to say just because we play two different styles of basketball. I don't know what your definition of better is. I hope to become an elite two-way player, playing offense and defense and doing that at the highest level and being one of those elite two-way players in the NBA, as I go throughout my career.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I strive to be better than him. Obviously a little sibling rivalry, but we also play like completely different just with the way our bodies are built. So you know, that's the answer you're looking for.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely gaming. I would say gaming, for sure, is one of the biggest ones. Fashion, stepping into it a little bit.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I'm a huge movie guy. That's something I always been into. Just pick up a movie and watch it. I love cinematography, so that's definitely probably the biggest one.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, probably. And a lot of family time. That's probably going to be a heavy dose of it, spend as much time as I can with friends and family, while also obviously staying locked in on basketball. But enjoying the moments with them before the season gets hectic and I'm going to be traveling all over the place.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, go to this afterparty. That's probably the biggest thing. I'm looking forward to enjoying that. Got all my closest friends and family there. I guess that's on my bucket list to enjoy.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"It was a surreal feeling. I mean, especially just sitting in that chair waiting, just to figure out which team was going to get me. For them to pick me, a lot of emotions were just going through me. I'm definitely blessed.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"Well, like you said, they have their trust in Bam. So I feel like once they have trust with me, it comes with me showing them that in practice. I feel like that's something that would elevate my game, just having that trust in me that I go out and make the right plays.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"A lot of people go into the transfer portal for money. I went in there for the right fit and I found the right fit. That definitely helped my career. Going into my sophomore season, actually getting to know the coaches. Just learning more things about the team just before I made the decision.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,I've got to go with Drake. OVO. OVO.,,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, I think the more I develop, I'll definitely be able to initiate offense at the one. Played two and three before. I think playing in the NBA, playing around in practice, I think I'll start to get used to it more, and then I think I can really take that role to the next level.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, the guards, we're a close group at Baylor. Every year, there's six guards. Y'all are competing against each other every day. Y'all are getting better watching a lot of film. We actually do call it Guard U.",,,,

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"It was unbelievable. It was a dream come true. It's something that I've been dreaming of since I've been a little kid.

It was my mom's birthday today, so that's an awesome thing to celebrate as well.",,,,

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I'd say my why is I feel like I've been underrated my whole entire life ever since I was coming out of high school. I've always had a chip on my shoulder, and to this day I'll always have that chip on my shoulder to go out there and prove people wrong.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, I would say to all the kids out there that don't have offers, you don't have to be the highest-rated kid in your class or whatever.
