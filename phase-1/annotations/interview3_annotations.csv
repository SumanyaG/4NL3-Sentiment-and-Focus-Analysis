2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just thought what she brings, she has that X-factor. Her ability to make one-on-one plays, to rebound the ball, to play great defense. I mean, all of it. And then to finish plays. Finish plays.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So I prepared her. Really, really proud of her. I know she's had a lot of adversity over here career, but the biggest game of her career, and she really rose to the occasion. For a young player, that says a lot about her. I mean, the future is pretty bright.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what's incredible about Ny is if you look back at the semifinal series, she didn't really play. Then she stayed ready and knew that in the Finals, her time will come and she continued to stick with it. When we needed her most, because you were the X-factor tonight, Ny.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, we were tired. We were trying to do whatever we could. We needed, like a spark and she was that. She continued to trust the process and we are so proud of Ny. So proud.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"When I hugged Stewie, I was sobbing in her ear. I didn't say one word. I was just crying the whole time. I'm so happy to win and do it with her. We talked about it so much, about coming together and what we envisioned of what we wanted to do in New York, and what we could do, to be able to pull it off and accomplish a dream. It's so freaking hard to do. It just means a lot. It means a lot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I told her this before, but I've watched Stewie be great for so long, in high school and then in college and then in the WNBA. For a long time, she was that person that I was kind of like chasing in college I want my game to be at her level and play against her in the WNBA and to ultimately be teammates.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But then I think it was picture perfect to be able to embrace JJ. Really what I was saying was like, she led us. Her dominance in the paint, on the boards, help-side defense. Everything that we needed, she was there.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,Definitely was.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"The wait was so, so, so worth it. We talked about it two years ago when it was free agency, and we wanted to come together. You look back and me, JJ, Sloot, we all came together to win a championship. Last year we lost in the Finals. But look at us, now we're here.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,THE MODERATOR,"There's no practice tomorrow, so....",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was like, let's go. You know, I've won one championship. I've been in many Finals and competed for so long. It's hard to win because this league is so good. You need a little bit of luck on your side, but you also need talent. You also need talent, the right talent to put together.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,I think Jonathan Kolb did a really great job of getting these players to come to New York and sell the vision that we had here. We wanted to win. New York has never won before.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,Now we are going to go in the history books as the first ever. That makes me very proud. Because it's hard. People think it's easy.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I was excited just to coach great talent. I didn't really know them that well. I knew Stewie probably a little bit more than JJ because I coached her wife, Marta, in Phoenix. Hopefully that helped a little bit to get her here.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's a journey. So it's getting to know each other. I think it's been fun. Hey, let's not stop at one, though. Let's go for two.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I'm not really sure exactly when we flipped the switch. I just remember just like weathering the storm and us really talking about making sure we kept our emotions in check and that we just kept executing and that it was going to be a grind. I think obviously we came out with the win, but I don't really remember an exact moment where the switch was flipped.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,How big was Leo's three in the corner? I'm going to tell you this as a fact Whoever scores first in overtime usually wins. I was confident after that.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Am I really the only New Yorker on this team? That is incredible.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Honestly, winning in Seattle was amazing and nothing takes away from that. But to be able to bring the first ever to the Liberty and the first in 51 years -- like you guys know, my first WNBA game I ever went to was at MSG, was the Liberty. And to have that be full circle was amazing.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"And I was calm. I was ready because I knew that no matter what, the city was going to have our back. They showed up and they showed out, and they continued to be there for us when we needed. I'm so proud of this team but so happy to be able to bring the first championship here because the city deserves it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen this next week, but I'm sure s--- is going to be crazy.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Parade in the Bahamas.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Really, really proud of JJ. I love coaching her. I just love her personality, how she brings it every single day. She was big for us. It wasn't a pretty game today. But we were trying to establish her early. At both ends, she worked her butt off. Usually I don't like to play her 42 minutes, but she just stayed competing because that's how important it was. She knew how she needed to help us. She's been big for us. She's been big for us all season long but particularly these playoffs. She's amazing. We love you, JJ. So proud of you, mate. You deserve this. Your first one, baby.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,We want to have an exhibition game in the Bahamas next year.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Parade.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Parade, too.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"Parade, too.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"For me, just trying to get the infrastructure of the Bahamas to be a little bit better for sports and especially girls sports in the Bahamas to be a little bit better. I think you need more investment in sports in the Bahamas, to give the kids more games and to allow them to be able to have more developmental camps and different things going on. Just to have more people invested in it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I want to make it my mission to help just grow the game in the Bahamas because we have so much natural talent. So many people that come out of the Bahamas go to the U.S. and go to school, end and up be being really successful. I would like the kids to be able to stay home in the Bahamas and stay with their families and then still be able to come to the U.S. to play professionally. That's the next step we have to take.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I'm really proud of my journey. I was talking to Rebecca Lobo earlier after shootaround and just basically telling her, I was doing this thing where we are about to run out after our theme or whatever and they would have the theme music playing. I would look up and be just taking everything in and just really being appreciative of the moment and just having a moment of gratitude without -- with all the chaos that was going on in the Finals, just a moment to just exhale, to breathe and just look around at all the things that we've been able to do, and all the people that are in the gym watching women's sports and the city, like Stewie said, really supporting us.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"That's a big lineup right there. But I mean, it means a lot, obviously. She did say something at halftime. But I feel like throughout the whole season, it's been unwavering support, whether from Sandy or my teammates and in general, everybody in this organization has always kind of believed in me, which means so much. They drafted me knowing I had to sit out a year. That just shows how much trust they have in me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"I feel like this whole season, every time I'm on the floor, my teammates have my back and tell me just to keep going, work hard. It means the world to be able to have players like Stewie and JJ, who I've looked up to my whole career, be my teammates, and now win a championship with them. That's something that I will remember forever.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"It's really hard to compare the Olympics to this moment. Especially with Team USA, because at the Olympics, we were going for eight straight gold medals. The pressure is insane, but also the pressure bringing a championship to a city that has never had one, especially in the WNBA, has been a lot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't know, this is something that I think I'll be remembering forever, and each Olympics I also remember forever. But the time together is so short. Like, it's three weeks.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But like, this is my team. This is my squad. We continue to go to battles together. With the Olympics, you come together for a few days. You have practice and then you go and you play exhibition games against Germany in London, and it's hard to build that chemistry and stuff. But you just know you're Team USA and here now, we're New York Liberty.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't think I answered your question, but each one is really special, and they are not comparable.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, this one? This is more personal. This is more personal because I'm from New York. I'm from upstate. I came here for a reason, and that's to win a championship.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Thank you for that shaking Breanna's hand.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,You speak German? Go for it.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Really it's just the mental preparation of staying ready and being locked in, knowing that whenever you have -- like whatever minutes you get, that's what you get and you need to be ready to go on the floor. Because our team has such a high standard, and really, to be able to live up to that, you have to be mentally ready. Otherwise, you'll just kind of hurt the team in the long run.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"But with great teammates like that, it's kind of easy to just get on the floor and leave it all out there. Because my role is pretty simple Run the floor, get rebounds and maybe shoot some buckets. But they make it really easy. They make it really easy for me. It's just like I always said, there's so much talent on the floor, and just being able to bring something to that is just something everybody dreams of.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Pepper, we got you. We got you. But it's not tomorrow.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just went in and told them what I saw and what we needed to do, the adjustments. Obviously I didn't think we were playing with the right amount of urgency. Things were a little too easy for them, and so I just encouraged them. Hey, let's go, 20 more minutes. Then I talked about the big lineup. Be ready for the big lineup. I just thought, I was thinking that all day today, and if things are going hard, we're fatigued. It's been a grueling schedule, five games, and that's a tough team, just the way that they make us work really hard.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I'll talk for the players.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Yes, please.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what we said was Minnesota, they had 34 points at halftime. Our offense wasn't coming easy, but eventually it was going to come through. Continue to shoot your shots with confidence. But if it's going to be an ugly game, we will win ugly. We've talked about first five minutes, first five minutes, whatever. No. Third quarter. Third quarter is going to be our quarter, especially with the city behind us and the fans behind us. We came out and continued to execute. I think throughout the entire game, we talked about coming together. Huddling, talking about schemes, making sure everybody is calm and confident. And we did that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yes, we did.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying laughter.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Seven games next year.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Basically we knew we had more in the tank to give and 20 more minutes for the end of the season.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I felt like, because I was just thinking about today, and it's like whether we win or lose, we want to put it all on the line. Because last year when we lost, there was more in the tank. And this year, that wasn't happening.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure. All season long, Lan has been in those positions for us. Just appreciate her ability to turn around and buck up and do what her team needed her to do. She's important. Important for her to be on the floor for us.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I thought it was obvious what we were trying to do. We went four flat and said, Court, make a play. The last thing we said was, we've got to get the last shot. Didn't want to shoot too early. Make sure we get the last shot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"The same defense as always. Try to make it as hard as possible for them to get the shots they want. They are good players. They are going to get shots off. But they can't get easy ones. So that's my goal, to make it as hard as I can.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it's an epitome of the year she's had and how important she's been to the team. Shot making, big three. She's a hustle-play player, so that was on display. Go give yourself a chance to maybe either put it in or get fouled.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,That's just what she does every day we are around her. She's the same. You can always count on her to be there for you. We're obviously super proud of Bridget.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Same. I completely agree. I feel like Bridget is just so reliable every time. Like Coach said, we can bank on her to make those hustle plays and to be cool and collected at the end to make those free throws. That's the hardest shot, honestly, in basketball, is to make free throws at the end of the game. To make those at the down at the big moment is who BC is.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,They were saying Naz Reid free tattoos. I think BC free tattoos is next.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I think you hit the nail on the head. It's unfortunate those teams were a joy to watch. But it's a sign of the times where we are now.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't know about these guys, but I know when I'm out and I'm in different places and I'm going to one, everyone is talking about it. Everyone is talking to me about it, talking about, I go to this bar, and this is a bar that maybe wouldn't have a women's game on five years ago. All the TVs have the game on and the volume on, and the place is going crazy. I heard that so many times in different establishments.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that what this team has done, obviously the Wolves energized the city in their playoff run, and I'm thrilled to see the same energy came for this team because they deserve it. Obviously the crowd was there tonight, but even more than that, everywhere you go around the city, people are talking about the Lynx.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"It's really tough. I think we are both great players. It was Game 4 and we played each other, what, four times in the regular season. It's going to get harder and harder each time to get the shots that you normally get.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Everyone is out there to do the same thing make shots hard. That's my goal every time. She's a great player, one of the best players in the world. But you have to make it as hard as you can for her.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to answer the second part, the Game 5. I don't really think about the other ones. I do feel very blessed in my career to have a chance to have been a part of so many. Haven't won them all. You know, when I was in Detroit, we suffered a heartbreak at home. So it runs the gamut. I think that what I'm just thrilled about is that this group gets to experience the Game 5.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It's beyond words how we feel about this team, and we just so wanted them to be in the Finals, No. 1 and two, put themselves in a position to win a championship, and we've done just that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't get a response from the league. I have a text to prove it. I think that -- I think Phee has some things to prove that the fouls weren't called.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Wish I knew. I'd either not eat or not sleep or I'd sleep really good if I knew the difference. It's two great teams. Who knows? Who knows.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I wanted to come out and enjoy the moment and be as aggressive as possible. When you're playing for your season, after the last game you sit with everything, and you erase it and you want to leave all those internal feelings and put it out there and embrace the crowd.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I just wanted to be out there with my teammates and give it everything we had. Shots go in, they don't go in, whatever. There are always things you can fix. But I was just excited to be out there and compete again after the last game. Shots were falling. That's always a good thing.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,We were celebrating together and she was saying how proud she is of us and the team. I was telling her that she has to get her butt to New York.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Anybody that has been following along knows this team, from the beginning of the season all the way through to Game 4, has this unique ability to believe in themselves and believe in each other. What we said before the game, can we do it in the toughest of times, right. Because this will be the most that we are tested. We talked about it in shootaround. This will be the most this group has been tested in that way.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I was sure how we would connect and compete. Not sure whether you're going to win the game or not. But I was sure that we were going to be the Minnesota Lynx and how we have done things all season long. You know, the ups and downs and all of that, this group is just equipped to handle it. It's special.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It was expected. Going into the game, we talked about it in the pregame that we were going into the game as if that didn't happen. Whatever was going to show itself was going to show itself and we were going to react. But we didn't have any minute restrictions and anything else we were doing to modify. Just competed.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, Ceci is tough. You know, goes through a stretch of games where maybe she's not contributing like she wants to contribute, and then all of a sudden we had a Ceci sighting at shootaround the other day and these last two games really helping us.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy for her. We've always stayed in touch through the years. We've always tried to get her back here. Timing was good for this one, and she's been a great fit for us.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Sounds like he's rooting for them. He didn't text that to me.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I love it.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,Huskies drama.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Looks like I'm going to have to text him about some things now.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Bench was really important. We knew they were going to be. They were ready. They were ready. There was a lot of conversations, the teammates, getting them going and getting them ready to be able to make contributions when they got in the game. Give Dorka credit as she remained patient, and when she got the opportunity, I thought her minutes were good. We'll look at the video. But it was nice to be able to have players able to sub in and stay out there for extended time.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Is that why we missed layups so we can get down to the nitty-gritty? Is that what she's saying? Laughter.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. Laughter. My heart is still racing.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think we gain energy and confidence from one another. I feel like internally we are strong, strong-minded mentally and physically. We have a lot of belief within our group. We problem solve with each other. It's just a belief, like, internally. I don't know how else to explain it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, last 40 minutes of the season. It could be anywhere, really. It doesn't matter. We are going to be out there together going to war, and I'm pumped.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to say probably information gathered in the three games. Everything is getting harder. So the edge that maybe other games that provided each team, there's no secrets at this point.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I actually was trying to call a timeout, but they didn't hear me. So that's on me. But yeah, you know, it wasn't our best possession. It was loud in here. I don't know, maybe I just have to sprint out in the middle of the court next time. So I've got to be better.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think that I was going a little bit too fast. I just needed to slow down. They are sending multiple people when I'm slipping on a screen, stuff like that. A little bit better awareness on my part. But quick turnaround and be ready for Sunday.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"With the two seconds? Yeah, it was like a little screen to get JJ to the block. If not, Sabrina had to come out. So with two seconds, we tried to establish the big girl down low. They defended it well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, obviously they are great players. I think Stewie said it, we took some shots, we probably could have moved it a little bit more.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, I will say this, and I look at the thing here and I know Cheryl talked about it last time, but we got no calls today. So do I need to talk up in a press conference? Because they were getting ticky-tacks. And we went down there and got hit and get nothing. It was like 12-6 at halftime and they tried to even it up near the end. It was 14-9.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No. All we want is fair, okay. So if we are getting hit, that's a foul. You know, I'm one of the nicest bloody coaches in this league, but this pisses me off. Just be fair. You know, if they are getting hit, it's a bloody foul.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that expletive timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,JONQUEL JONES,It's a close-out game. Their backs are against the wall and we are trying to win. It was going to be that type of game tonight where we are both trying to claw and both teams are trying to figure out whatever to do to get over the hump.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I have a lot of respect for Minnesota, don't get me wrong. This is a really tough team, really tough team. They play well. They compete. So we've got one more game, and we're going to win on our home court.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"Short-term memory. Just the fact that all that happened tonight is the series is even, and there's a Game 5, winner-take-all. We are going back to New York, and we're going to get it done. You know, getting it done there.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that one of the things, and you know, like I was saying after Game 1, you feel like the ball isn't moving enough, and I think we got easy stuff when we were able to do that. We were taking hard shots. We had good shots. Didn't make shots, right, and that's what it comes down to.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Stewie was making shots. JJ's big three when we were up four, that was a big three. Then obviously Ionescu's shot at the end. It's a battle. We talked about that, players making plays. Unfortunately, we didn't make enough of them to put the ball in the hole.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I feel like they were making plays at the end of shot clocks and like Coach said, we were getting really good looks. We just weren't executing on the offensive end.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's just hard when you get that and then obviously they are a great offensive team and like Coach said in the locker room, it just puts a lot of pressure on our defense. I think we just need to make more shots, honestly.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't have an update, game finished what, 15 minutes ago? I haven't talked to the trainer.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,KAYLA McBRIDE,Great player made a good shot. I guarded her for 40 minutes.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, obviously give credit to Lan. She did what should he could do. We were plus 20 when she was on the floor. So it obviously hurt.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our starting five is a really good starting five, and you know, not having Lan, foul trouble, and then just not feeling like she could go put us in a bit of a bind.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, tried different things. You know, just a little bit of a small lineup. See if we could spread the floor and get some easier shots but that didn't produce itself either. We need our starters, just like they need their starters.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't necessarily know that it was -- obviously got fouled. She was, you know, asserting herself in that way. The game is called differently for Phee than it is for Stewie for sure. You look at the same level of activity, and around-the-rim contact. For whatever reason, we have a hard time getting to the foul line in this series.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I think they were getting some switches that they were picking on. You know, as Lan was switching on her. She made some great plays. She attacked, she made threes, she got it going.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our defense gave us a chance to win the game. Our defense gave us a chance to win the game, period, and our offense is going to help our defense.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"If you told me that we would have got the amount of stops that we did and we were playing off that, and we wouldn't have scored 80, that would be surprising to me. This team scored 80, its 77-all with the remaining seconds left.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I'll have to look at the film. I know when I was watching it live, I liked some of the shots that we were getting. I've seen our players make those shots.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, it's not to sit here and say, you know, that New York doesn't get credit for, you know, their defense. Just they are a good defensive team. I'll have to watch it but I felt like we got some good opportunities.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, yeah. We just need to score the ball a couple times. Just a couple times. We were up four. Like I said, that JJ three sort of changed things for them, right. If we get that stop and we just score one or two more times, that's our game.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's a hard-fought game, right. Really great game. That's one that, you know, we convert just a couple and it's our game.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"So, our defense, and like the things that you mentioned, we did those things. We played well enough at that end. Obviously, it seems crazy to say when Stewie has 30 but you know, she had 38, 39 on us and they only scored 78, 79 points. We were right there.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,For sure. For sure. That's what we just talked about. This is Phee's first Finals. So she's feeling these things for the first time. K-Mac has been there.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"The hardest thing to do, I imagine you guys feel it when you are watching, there's so many ups and downs and swings and all around, and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to sort of weather those swings, and here we are. We're disappointed. We're home. We played well and just couldn't come up with the win.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's important that you don't get too high when you win and too low when you lose, and it's really hard. It's really, really hard but we've got to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home with our tremendous fans. And you know, we'll see what we can do on Friday.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it feels great. I mean, that's something that -- obviously it's the ultimate goal is to be here and to get a win.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Doesn't feel great right now, obviously, with a loss. But I am excited to look at film and see what we can do better.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it feels amazing. The crowd was awesome. To play at home in the Finals is such a rush. So definitely looking forward to the next game.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Her contributions today, she was back to being BC for us. So we were glad to see that, and we'll continue that into game four.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,That was just a great All WNBA Second-Team performance laughter. That's it.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I mean, you know, in the time-out, Sandy kind of was just like, you're going to shoot this shot. You know, I feel like I was able to get a little separation in range and get a really good shot to go. Obviously wanting to let the shot clock wind down. And got the space that I needed to get my feet under me and felt comfortable taking that shot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn't. I've practiced that shot a thousand times in my head, on the court, and I feel like that's just something that as athletes, you put yourself in that position to want to be able to make a shot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we were all kind of just waiting for our moment. You know, waiting for the script to flip a little bit. You know, they talked about it. They talked about first five minutes, going to come out punching. They punched us in the face in the first quarter and we continued to wear them down.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We knew that our pace was something that made them tired and for me, it was just kind of like I was motivated. I was mad. And I liked my matchups that I had, and really kind of attacking them to make sure that we could get this back into where we needed to be for it to be a ballgame.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,That's why I can't be miked up.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I'm not sure exactly what the situation was. Might have been when it was 71-69, because I feel like we were at that score for a long time. But just I could feel it. You know, you could feel the momentum was shifting to our side.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,I was mad we were losing.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We know we're one game away from winning the championship, and I think that they are going to give us their best shot. They are going to give everything they have got, and you know what, so are we. The turnaround is quick but we are going to continue to be ready. There's a lot of things that we didn't do right tonight and have a kind of quick memory. I think that we're happy we got this win but we're -- the job's not done.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I just went up and gave him a big shot. Him and Jodie Berry, our assistant coach came down and he kind of told me the same thing, like there was never a doubt.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Obviously him, Sandy, all the coaches that I've had, just their continued belief and pouring into me means the world to me whether I make or miss that shot. Like the fact that they kind of trusted me to go out there and make big shots, that's why I love playing for this team and continue to pour my all.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's pretty special. It was never in doubt. Obviously Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there, but I thought the right time, this is Sabrina. She just made a big shot. She's a great shooter and she just needed a little bit of separation.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, definitely the biggest shot of my career and hopefully not the last.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,It did. Pretty nice.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Not for us. I think that, you know, this feels like we're playing on their home court, and I feel like each game is so different. You know, you go from 1 to 2 to 3. But the way that we continue to fight and be resilient. I don't want to speak for you guys. Doesn't feel like Game 1 to me. Feels like Game 3.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"At this point, I don't know.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think -- well, I think the way that we fought back in the second, knowing that our offense didn't really click yet but we were able to limit them defensively. But then in the third, when we had a strong push, a strong punch. You guys know the first two games, our third quarters have been a struggle to score offensively.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We were getting downhill. We were attacking and we were being confident. If a mistake happened, like a turnover or a missed shot or like something just doesn't go our way, we didn't panic. We continued to play and continued to fight through it because we know how big this moment is. We have the experience of the good, bad, ugly, and different.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, we didn't come out how we wanted to start the game. We knew they'd threw the first punch. I thought we weren't playing how we wanted to play physically, mentally with the pace and everything. But credit to them. They were taking us out of stuff that we wanted to do and they were making big shots.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I trust this team. I feel like we've grown so much. We've handled adversity even from Game 1, you know what I mean? It's like, okay, this is a totally different game here and we just had to chip away.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think that what the big three means is between Sab, JJ and myself, we know when it's our time to step up and to make an impact. And over the course of the game, it's like sometimes things are hard. Sometimes things are frustrating. I pick up two fouls in the first quarter. But knowing that our team trusts and believes in us to be in this position to take these shots, to help get the game in the right place, but at the same time we wouldn't be here without our teammates, and having that trust and belief just gives us confidence.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I think it's important to just read the game, and being able to get downhill and find JJ on a really important basket that, helped us late in the game. Because you're just not really one-dimensional. The defense doesn't know what you're going to do Are you going to shoot it are you going to pass it? Are you going to be a screener, a decoy? There's just so many opportunities that when you have the gravity we have to be able to make it tough on the defense.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"JJ was huge for us. The way that she protected the rim, hit a huge three, hit that layup, like just continue to go chip away, and it was a total team effort. Like Stewie said, we're not here without every single person on this team.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,Just in the locker room waiting on Stewie. I would say I really didn't realize how far out I was.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, like I kind of, you know, wasn't sure if I was dribbling with my right or left hand and then I was like, oh, yeah, I did hit that step-back.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I just didn't really realize how far I was, but like I said, it's a shot that I take often and I take in practice and that I take before the game. It's not like a Hail Mary, hope this goes in. It's like, once I got it off, I was like, yeah, this is in.",,,,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,I think he's handling it well. I think he's playing well.,,,,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"He was in the locker room before the game. Him, Adam Silver, and Dr. J, they were talking to us. Once they got done, I thought I was going to be able to shake his hand. I turned around, and he was gone.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I want to be taking these shots. I feel like knowing my teammates and that everyone has confidence in me is important. It's kind of like on to the next and still making sure I'm aggressive any time on the court. Obviously as a player, it's very frustrating. But bounce back for Game 2.",,,,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"For now I'm just a student of this league. I don't really know how everything works. Of course, it's something I want to be -- highly involved in the future, yeah.",,,,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I think it was the first four games, that West Coast trip, where I wasn't really playing well. I wasn't even shooting the ball, just kind of out there floating. That Utah game was where I had to snap out of it. I went to dinner the night before with two of my coaches and had a good talk with them. Just wanted to come out with a clear head. After that game, I knew it was over. I just didn't want to look back.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"So it's disappointing. I mean, congratulations to the Liberty on their first championship. Been around, I don't know, how long has the league been around? 28 years? It took them 28 years. Congrats to them. We were that close to our fifth. Just didn't happen.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"Probably say he'll be at the first game, and ""Don't suck."" Something he would probably say to me.",,,,

Trying to understand what Victor, Rudy or other French players really help me to develop myself as a player, first of all, in France, and hopefully now in the NBA.",,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I think the basketball in France has improved, and that's why we are here in this draft. Three French players in the top 10, it's not nothing.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, well, growing up in juniors, I'd always be the scorer, attacking the rim, being an offensive player and stuff. But as I headed into the pro league, being young, there's already people doing all that. You have to make sacrifices. You need to learn the game a bit more, learn your other strengths. For me, it was defense. My length, being able to guard different positions, different players, being able to switch on to different people and just using my length, my ability, my quickness to kind of get around people.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But throughout this entire process, my team has my back every step of the way and was just excited to have another opportunity to go to battle with them. Because we have a lot of fun in everything that we do, and you know, it's not always like that.",,,,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,I didn't get a chance to meet him. He came in and said some words to us as a group. He kind of like said hello to everybody. We didn't get a chance to really communicate or talk. But it was great. That was my first time ever seeing him up close and personal. I haven't seen him around Boston or anything. It was pretty cool to see him around.,,,,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Yeah, yeah. We feel like we can beat anybody on any given night. We're talented enough to do it, and it's just up to us bringing that same mentality. Yeah, it's encouraging when you know that you can compete with any team in the NBA.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I'm always so in awe of Phee because she carries it with such grace. She carries it her own way.

2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYLEN BROWN,"I've only been to a few. The only one I really can compare it to was Utah, because in Atlanta, the other one I went to, was COVID or whatever the case may be. So far, so good for me. I thought that was a great crowd, great energy. Turned out well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,We are the first team in WNBA playoff history to be down 15 and come back and win the game. So that ranks really high.,,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"It's disappointing. It's incredibly disappointing. But these guys, I mean, they've got to try to pick themselves up and go, ""We were that damn close."" It hurts. It hurts.",,,,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"That's definitely part of it. I feel like it started even in preseason. One of the first games I was back, I had 27 against the Spurs, and that was one of the times where I was, like, all right, I'm ready and prepared. I just kept that confidence, kept the same energy. Just stuck with my consistent work and just tried to produce.",,,,
