2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I started off just being an athletic girl, wanting to play hard, run around. Had a high motor. That kind of took me pretty far. I realized that that was something that was going to get me on the court, doing those little things, taking charges.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Then once I got to high school, my coach told me if you can guard multiple positions, you know you're going to play. So I think I carried that with me all the time. As I got into college, I started to watch film. I started to watch my opponents and learn different defensive schemes and all that stuff.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's been a journey, but it's been a great journey.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I actually am from New York, so I used to go to Liberty games growing up. I was a ball girl a couple times. I've been around the W for a little bit.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So being able to purchase tickets to sit front row, seeing that, they were giving out free tickets at one point for girls to come in and just have a crowd. To now playing against Iowa and selling out our crowd at home, just to see that evolution and that aspect, and now I haven't been to that many, but I think I went to one of the playoff games with the Liberty last year.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just to see that in itself, being a young girl, thinking that the stadium was so huge to coming in there going, you've played in stadiums like this but now it's filled up, it's filled to the top, I think it's great to show people that once you invest in women that they can give back in a lot of ways.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Once I learned that these colleges come and you get a free education and you get to experience so many different things -- I've had the opportunity to play on USA teams. So just for me, just understanding everything that comes with it. I didn't expect to be here, but I'm here, and I am so excited that Indiana has taken the opportunity on me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I played with Caitlin when I was at USA for a couple years. So we played together there. But from going against her this year to being able to play with her and also Aliyah Boston, as well, it brings me some comfort, honestly.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Very excited and so proud of what they've done and how they've grown, as well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, it was definitely a tough decision for me last year, but I told people that I would never trade the decision I made to go to Ohio State. I think it has brought me so much peace in who I have become as a player and the impact that I can make in any program that I choose or organization that I have the opportunity to be a part of.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that mindset and going into Ohio State and coming in and realizing that I can make a little impact, I'm not here to change anything, but I'm just here to sprinkle a little of me in there and try to impact in any way that I can is really helpful.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously adaptability is definitely a big thing, being able to go to a different country, adapt to the environment, adapt to the culture. Overseas is definitely a different way to play ball. They play ball pretty differently there. Just having that prior experience. I know there are a lot of people in the W that are from overseas.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that prior experience, even playing with the caliber of players that I played with, I think all in all, everything together has helped me become the player I am today. I'm very hopeful and very confident that it will help me in the W.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I think pro level of play would probably be the best one. It's just pretty different. They're used to playing against grown women. They're used to that physicality. I think all together it has helped me in many facets of the game of basketball.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's really focused on trying to make the team. Obviously that's the first step going into it, and having confidence in myself and trying to make that. If I do, and when I do get the opportunity to play against them, I think it's just going to be such a surreal feeling. I'm there to compete. I'm there to try to make a roster spot. I'm trying to stay in the league.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think a lot of it is just excitement, surreal, because I've seen them play. I was younger watching them play. But definitely very competitive and just excitement.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I didn't have the opportunity to really, really get to know her. When I was recruited by Ohio State coming out of high school, she was there. So I got to see her on my visits a couple times. That was probably the biggest interaction. But very hands on, very big about coming to be a Buckeye.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think it's kind of interesting that that was the school that I was looking at coming out of high school. I ended up finishing my college career there, and now I get to play with a Buckeye. I think that's also going to give me some comfortability. She's a great player and so much I can learn from her. I'm just ready to go in there to work and continue to learn.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's special. I think taking that fifth year was something I thought long and hard about and I'm glad I did. A lot of good things came from it. Obviously having Emmy next to me it makes everything easier and that much more special. She's had a huge impact on me and everyone at Ohio State, and it's been really cool to see.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"She's everything to me. She's my why. She's why I do it, why me and my brother work so hard at it. She's special, and I really hope so. I know it'll be a little harder for them to travel, but I feel like absolutely they'll make it to some games.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's a surreal moment because I grew up as a little kid watching all these women play and how talented they are and being able to have a chance to play with them and compete against them, it's a dream. It's what we all are here for, and it's what we're looking forward to.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Absolutely. I think that's something that's really big in today's world, especially with our class. It's exciting just to have those opportunities as women athletes. I think that's something that is kind of new to us, and it's exciting and it's absolutely something people should take advantage of. To be honest, I'm just ready to go play ball down there right now.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I think there's going to be an adjustment period for all of us, whether people want to admit it or not. I'm looking forward to it and welcoming it. As a rookie I think that's something you have to accept and be ready for.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"The pace, the length, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of things that are a little different and it'll take some time to get used to, but I'm welcoming that challenge and looking forward to it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot. I've gotten to spend some time with some vets the past couple days and they've been really helpful. Just staying confident with who you are and what you do well is something that I took from them just a couple days ago. But I think that's important because when you're good at something, you can excel in that area and really keying in on that and taking that with you to the next level is definitely something I'll take from them.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"I'm excited to play with everyone, to be honest on that team. Like I said, I grew up watching them, and I think being able to play with them now and getting that opportunity is something that, like I said, was a dream. They're a really talented group, and I know they're going to push me day one when I get there, so I'm excited for that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Competing really against everyone. The league is -- the talent, you guys have seen it and it's no joke and it's something I'm looking forward to and excited for, and like I said, there will be an adjustment, but I'm super excited.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"As far as representing the university and our fans, I hope we made them proud.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My conversations were great with T Spoon. As you know, she was coached by Coach Mulkey, so I kind of thought maybe I'll go there. Knowing like the conversations were so good and she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a Black woman and as a head coach, and everything she's done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Jeff Pagliocca, the GM, was amazing, too, and player development is something that I was looking for and they looked for in me. I'm super excited for this move, and I'm just looking forward to getting to Chicago.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My first time playing Kamilla was on one of the biggest stages in my life, when she played for Hamilton Heights and I played for St. Frances in high school and we battled. Now being able to be teammates is going to be amazing.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I actually talked to her earlier, was congratulating her. I know she came off an amazing run, an amazing college career. I'm looking forward to playing with her in practice and in games, just bouncing off of each other. So I'm excited for this.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I have had so many people reach out to me from so many different places. Understanding our impact isn't just within our school, within just the U.S., but it's worldwide. It's amazing to see.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Going out of the country when we go out of the country with my team, with LSU, it was like so much fun because they all recognized us and they knew us and it felt like home. I feel like anywhere we all go, and this draft class is amazing, anywhere we go, we're known. This is super cool because women aren't usually recognized around the world like how we are, and it's not even just basketball. It's the impact we've left on people's lives outside of there. It's super cool to see.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I think our duo, me and Kamilla versus Cam and Rickea is going to be cool to see. That's going to be fun.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Just be you. A lot of people may just tell you that you can't do certain things, and you're going to get more yeses and nos, and I had to realize that. Just being able to be authentic, and people love me because of who I am. I had those tough conversations. I say things that a lot of people are scared to say, and take that scary step. I took a scary step of faith going to LSU, not knowing what could happen, and look how my life has completely changed.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Being able to just believe in yourself, trust in yourself and have an amazing team behind me is great.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I mean, I didn't know what I was going to do. Obviously coming back would have been amazing for me, but I wanted more for myself. I wanted to start over. I feel like I had been at a high since the National Championship, and I want to hit rock bottom. I want to be a rookie again. I want to be knocked down by vets, and I want to be able to get up and grow and be a sponge.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I'm just super excited to play with the amazing players and against amazing players. This league is really competitive and I'm a competitive player, so I want to play against a lot of great players.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Well, my mom was crying before the show even started, so it started there. Then my brother was like agitating me, I bet you 100 that you cry, I bet you 100 that you cry. He kind of got me, too. And I had a great conversation, like she was saying, with Chicago, so I kind of knew -- if it wasn't the Mystics, I knew it was going to be Chicago that was going to be calling me home.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"It means everything. I mean, like I said, on and off the court, we're amazing. We're not just basketball players, we're super impactful to the community, the people around us, the little kids that look up to us, and being able to also be nationwide, everybody knows us everywhere we go. Our lives aren't normal. We might get a little bit of normalcy going into the league now, but I'm just excited to be a trailblazer.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, it's huge. Obviously traveling from the other side of the world or from Australia, it's a lot. Like I'm still jet-lagged and everything. I've still got emotions running through and I can barely sleep. But it's great.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"It's great to just look back, knowing that my country back home, my family and my friends they're all proud of me and they're all supporting me, watching me, especially my mom. She's done so much for me, my family and stuff, making sacrifices for us. Growing up I didn't come from a big basketball sporty world, and just played it because I loved it and my siblings played it, and then to get where I am now, it's incredible.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Obviously being in Australia, it's a bit difficult to watch the games and get to it and stuff, but I think as the years progressed, we started getting to know the game a bit more and obviously it's like a little sisterhood. We've got the WNBL now on our side and we've got the WNBA, so you get to know about it. And we've got Australians and grads that play in the WNBA, as well, so then you get to study that, as well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"For me, I think when I play defense and I play great defense, it brings my offense naturally. So it's like, it just comes to me, and I don't have to force anything. So that's probably why I do that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"All of them. All the WNBA players. It's so different back home. Again, like in the WBNL we do have imports that come and play, we had Tiffany Mitchell, Jordin Canada and being able to play against them and with them is huge, no matter whether they're guards or bigs, just playing against all of them and seeing the differences in how they all play and just -- yeah.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's amazing. Like I haven't been there before, but stories, everything I've heard about it, we've got fellow Aussies over there, as well. We've got Paul Goriss that's also there, as well, and he's been good to me, as well. He's talked to me then and there. He's been texting me and stuff, and Kristy Wallace. She's amazing, as well, on the court and off the court, as well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"But I think just getting to know everyone, getting the experience, the new lifestyle and just -- as well as the coaches and the staff and everything.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's cool. It's amazing seeing fellow Australians in the WNBA, and they're achieving what you're achieving, as well. It's a privilege, honestly. It's such a great thing, and it's like -- I feel like it's just good that people can look at it and be like, wow, these Australians can play because I feel like that's one thing we don't really get sometimes, and we've had people like Lauren Jackson providing that for us.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I hope one day we can leave that kind of legacy to younger kids and everyone, as well, in this generation, as well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm not really having any expectations. Just going in there with an open mind, making sacrifices. It's going to be hard. I'm young. They're great professional players, talented athletes. It's going to be hard, and I'm coming from a different country, different environment and a new lifestyle.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I think it's great because I could do both, and either spot they need me to play that I could just sharpen in that area and get really good and just excel.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I think that I just bring versatility and just a physicality to the game of basketball, and so that's what mostly they'll be seeing from me.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,Just that I'm a humble person and somebody who is really for the community and just loves to represent my people. I think I just especially this year just try to tap into representing my culture and just being that inspiration for young kids who look like me and are of my same background.,,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I just think that impact is something that I'll carry with me to the WNBA, and I just hope that's what people see.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I have a little bit. Gianna and Jenna have talked about Minnesota a lot and just how it is a very basketball-oriented state, and there's been so much rich culture of that there. So I'm excited to see it and experience it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,I'm very excited to just be able to play at the next stage and kind of just improve in areas that I need to to really excel at the next level.,,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, growing up in Alaska was great. I would say I loved my childhood. It was just so much fun, camping, fishing, doing a bunch of outdoor stuff, and it's a beautiful state. The only problem I think was just the isolation it had from the rest of the world, and how much it lacked exposure and just sports and things like that. But I wouldn't have had it any other way. I loved my state and carry that with a lot of pride.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I know going to Minnesota the cold probably won't bother me since I'm used to that, but I'm excited to be in a new environment and place.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"The football question, that's just played a big part in my life, I think, just kind of building up the physicality I played with. It's helped me a lot with that. Just having an older brother, he plays for the Dolphins now, just kind of looking back on it, how we were literally on the same team and competing against each other, it's cool to see.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"We're both very fortunate to be doing what we love at the highest level, and it's just a blessing.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"But yeah, I think I'm super motivated. Obviously since being a kid I've always wanted to play in the WNBA. To have this opportunity means the absolute world to me, and I'm just excited to go out to Phoenix and get started.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I'll definitely miss the people. I love my teammates, my coaches and the staff around there, and them helping me so much. I know that in the dub I'll be a little bit more independent, so I'll probably miss the extra help of people telling me what to do. But I'm excited for what's next.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I know at some point I have to grow up, so...",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think it really was. I think I learned so much about myself as a player and especially as a leader. We had a really young team this past year, and I felt like I was able to grow my game and my leadership. I loved playing with my teammates and they always challenged me to be better, but I definitely think any leadership. I used to be so shy as a kid, so to see where I am now, I'm just so proud of that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I'm so excited to learn from both of them. Obviously they have a lot of great guards there, and Diana Taurasi is like the GOAT of basketball, so to be able to learn from her is going to be so fun and I can't wait for that. Natasha Cloud, I love her energy. I love when she used to play for Mystics and she was so fun to watch.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I mean, if you saw my face, I don't think anything was going through my head at the moment. I was so positively overwhelmed, and just having all of them around me, all my people in the stands, at the table, knowing that my family, my friends from back home are watching, it's surreal. It's why I'm here. Without them, I would never be here sitting and answering your questions.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Thank you for your question. I love Sue. I love her so much. I remember watching her when I was a kid, trying to mimic her moves. Being at UConn after her has been a huge deal for me. Very, very humbling experience. She's one of the greatest.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"To be able to have this opportunity again, I mean, it's a full-circle moment for me. I can't believe it. It's got to be some higher power, something else going on, because I have no words for this. It's a full-circle moment for me, and I'm just so blessed.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I honestly have no idea about the jersey number. That's honestly the least thing on my mind. That's not what I'm thinking about, but when I find out, I'll find you and tell you first.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. I feel like going back to when I had to make my college decision, UConn was a challenge, especially coming in with my class, Paige Bueckers, No. 1 player in the country, that was a huge challenge, but I took it. I feel like it paid off, and that's one decision that I'm so happy and proud that I made in my life because all of that led to this.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to your question, I feel like first and foremost, I obviously -- their roster, just looking at it, those are some iconic women. Those are some iconic basketball players, people that I want to learn from, that I want to listen to, that I want to get challenged by, that I want to get yelled at, everything, all of the above. I'm ready for it, and I feel like it's kind of like a similar thing for me going to UConn and going to this place. Obviously, this is the next level.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"The one thing that I want to bring is being a good teammate. I want to create amazing relationships over there.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Well, first and foremost, I feel like this was something that I didn't even dare to dream about, if I can say it that way. I always felt like it was such a reach. It was something far more beyond me and bigger than me. But luckily I had people around me, my teammates, my friends, my family, my coaches, everybody that made me believe in it, too.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I always trust my work ethic. I feel like that's my best asset, how hard I work, how I don't give up, how I learn from my mistakes.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Obviously I'm going to fail, and that's fine. But it's how you react to it. I'm ready for all the challenges. I'm ready for whatever is thrown my way. But I know I'm going to respond in a positive way and how a true competitor does.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. Thank you for the question. I feel like as you grow, you learn and you mature. When I came in as a freshman, I didn't understand that you don't have to be in the gym all day. It's how hard you work for those 45 minutes, those 20 minutes, and how consistent you are with it. I feel how my coaching staff, especially Morgan Valley, my coach, she kind of helped me guide me through that. This last, my senior year, I spent 25 minutes before every single practice, even on the days that I didn't feel like it, even on the days that I was tired, and shot threes and shot mid-ranges.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"That 40 percent that you mentioned is purely the testament to my hard work and dedication and her being in that gym with me every time. I'm so grateful to her. But I'm also very proud of myself and how I just remained consistent and proved to myself that consistency is the key, because hard work I already have it. Consistency was the key for me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yes, thank you. I feel like us UConn players, we're a family. It doesn't matter if we played 30, 20, 10 years ago or even before that, or you're playing right now or you are going to play in the future. Everybody is connected. That's what the coaching staff does a great job of, creating that family atmosphere, that strong bond and connection that lasts forever.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"That's how it is with Sue. She's been over to UConn so many times, whether that's like fun stuff or coming to watch our games or trying to help us and guide us and give us advice, because we all truly look up to her a lot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I mean, I'll say it again, it's a full-circle moment for me. All the things that kind of led up to this, it's crazy. I can't believe it. But I'm just super grateful and I can't wait to see her. I'm sure she's going to be of a great help, and my mentor and somebody that's going to guide me, and I want that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to your other question. Absolutely, Nneka, Skylar, those women are incredible, on and off the court. I can't wait to learn from them, and of course I watched them. Skylar, I watched her so much. Nneka, I mean, she hugged me and I almost passed out over there. And obviously the rest of the team. When you look at the names, what they've done -- I always go back to not just on the court but off the court with the influence that they have. I can't wait to be a part of that. I can't wait to learn. I can't wait to just listen and sit back and try to get everything I can from such influential, iconic women. I'm super, super excited. I can't wait to meet all of them.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, I mean, that's a funny question because growing up, I didn't really have the opportunity to watch WNBA games. Even now in Croatia, people have to find their ways to watch those games. I feel like what I remember, I would sit in my living room with YouTube and find games or highlights or anything that I can. I remember watching Brittney Griner in my living room. It's just those little things that stick with me. But it was hard to find places and ways to watch these women.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I feel like seeing now especially with this draft class that I'm a part of, amazing athletes, amazing people that brought women's basketball to another level, and I always say, all the players before us that paved the way for us, they deserve their flowers, and they deserve to be recognized. I feel like we're moving toward that direction, and I never think it's too late. I always think there's time to be better and improve and grow, and I feel like we're on the right track.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, Aaliyah has been there from the start. That's my sister. That's my family. I met her even before we both committed to UConn. Can you guys believe how full circle -- it's so many full-circle moments I can't even fathom right now. We met before at NBA Academy, BWB, and I loved her instantly. Our bond is strong. We don't need no words. You can feel it. You can feel the energy. To be able to here with her and share this has been nothing but incredible, and something that I'll remember for the rest of my life because it would not be the same if she wasn't here with me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I'm so proud of her. She's going to do amazing. She's going to do great. Everything that she did, she deserves. She put her head down and she worked. Even without all the recognition that she did deserve but she didn't get at times, she didn't care. She put her head down and she knew that something great will happen, and it did tonight. I'm so happy for her.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to the other question, Paige, Azzi, Aubrey, Caroline, all my teammates watching at home, I love them so much. I owe them everything, and I can't wait for my younger teammates and everybody that's coming back next year to have this moment, too, because I know they will. I'll be proudly watching and cheering for them, too.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,I'm just so grateful to be able to call them my sisters and my family and have such great support even though I'm not home. This is my home away from home. They are my home away from home.,,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yes, absolutely. I feel like I couldn't get more prepared than being at UConn, surrounded by all the coaches, but especially Coach. He's just a legend. When UConn called, I couldn't say no. That was the opportunity of a lifetime for me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,Every single thing in that culture that he built in that program aligns with me and who I am as a person and who I strive to be and get better at being.,,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But just the things I went through with him is so much, and he's my best friend. He's not just my coach, he's my best friend. He's been there from the start. When I failed, through the worst things, through the best things, he always stuck by my side and never left. I'll cherish that bond and that relationship that I have with him forever.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I'm so grateful and happy that he was there tonight, along with all my coaches, at the table and in the audience. They prepared me. They pushed me. They cussed me out when they had to. They yelled at me when they had to. They praised me when they had to. They just did everything right.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"So grateful because not just as a basketball player they have changed me, but they changed who I am as a person. They made me a better person and they make me want to be even better. I'm grateful for them.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I think my emotions have been so up and down over the last six weeks. I had different expectations in February than I did at the end of March. I think I've been dealt with what I've been dealt with, and the only way to really move on is to have a positive outlook.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I'm really excited, and that's my No. 1 emotion right now.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Well, they're always there for me, first of all, no matter if I go out and have 25 in a game or if I can't play. I know they're going to be at the game. They're going to be the first ones hugging me afterward. That support has meant the world to me over the last 15 years that I've been playing basketball or sports at all.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"For them to be able to be here with me on draft night, my family, my sister, my parents, it means everything to me. It's not just a testament to what I've been able to do but how they've been able to help me get here.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I didn't start playing basketball super seriously until probably middle of high school, so I wasn't exposed to it super early. But I also think the media didn't push it as much. Even though I played basketball in high school, it wasn't necessarily something that was super popular in the media.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"But I'm super excited for it to be taking that trajectory. The class that I'm in right now has done an incredible job to bringing attention to women's sports, women's basketball, and now taking it into this league I think is super exciting.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I think we're already seeing the impact of that on little girls. I think they're way more aware of it than I was at that age, and that's super exciting. I think with expansion coming up and all that stuff, it's headed toward a really good place. I'm really excited to be a part of it.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"That means everything. Those five years at Virginia Tech were so, so special. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The people I had around there, the teammates, the coaches, they were just incredible. They made me who I was. For me to bring that attention to Virginia Tech, to take it to a Final Four, win ACC championships, was just so fun. For them to recognize me I think is really, really cool, but it's also just making me really proud of the program that we were able to create there.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I was just able to talk to Coach Becky Hammon a little bit. Obviously there's a little bit more to be figured out, but she spoke about the medical staff there and just working on getting me out there, so we can see where I am and start taking those steps to get me back on the court again because obviously that's the ultimate goal.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"But I'm super excited. I think seriously it's a great fit for all of those things. I know that they'll support me, and we'll all have the same goal of getting me healthy and helping to contribute. We'll take it day by day but with that in mind for next year.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah. I mean, he's taught me everything I know. I didn't come into college expected to be anything really. I really didn't take basketball super, super seriously. I thought I wanted to play softball when I was little in college. He completely changed my perspective on that. He made me fall in love with the game to the point where you couldn't get the two of us out of the gym together. We just love spending time with each other in there.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"I'm so excited to play with Cam. We're both competitive. We're young. We're feisty but we're still going to bring that game offensively and defensively. I know if I get beat off the dribble, Cam is swatting into the second row. So I'm ready for that, too.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm excited to bring my versatility, play at any position, taking advantage of whether it's a small guard on me or bigger or slower player. I'm excited about that. Then I just want to work on getting in tip-top shape after the injury. My conditioning was in the game trying to get back. I feel like when I'm in tip-top shape, world-class shape, that's when I'm playing my best both ends of the floor.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm definitely excited. I'm just grateful that L.A. believed in me. They see something in me, and I see something in them, too. I had great talks with them prior to the draft, so I'm just grateful for it all.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Playing at Tennessee and Mississippi State, it's prepared me for this moment because life is just trials and tribulations, but how you get through those, and I feel like I've overcome a lot of adversity. I've continued to stay strong, and that's what got me to where I am today.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, it's crazy to say, but I didn't even think about how the draft process goes. I thought you just show up to draft day and you kind of get drafted. I didn't know if they even speak to you prior to the draft. Really crazy of me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'll answer your second question first. Definitely. This is generational class. I feel like this class is just so different. I know this class is different. I feel like the viewership is peaking. Women's basketball is on an uproar. Everybody is tuning in. We averaged better than the men this year. Not to say we're in competition, but that just says a lot. I'm grateful to be a part of this draft class. I feel like we're just trending in the right direction.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Probably the pace of the game. I feel like high school to college, it was a different pace, so I feel like it's probably going to be that same thing in the league, going up against the world's best players. I feel like that's going to be pretty tough. But I'm excited for the challenge.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, to be in the conversation with those greats is so crazy and mind blowing to me. I'm just grateful to have Candace come to our games sometimes, have Tamika Catchings, have Jordan Horston in my ear, and they continue to support me. Jordan texted me how much she was proud of me, texted me a little bit about the process. Tamika and I speak every now and then. She's just always pouring into me. I just call her my big sister. Just to have that contact with a Tamika Catchings, it's like, whoa.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"She doesn't even know it, but when she came to our practice and she was acting like she knew me, you don't even know but I was over here like, girl, you're Tamika Catchings. That was pretty cool to experience, though.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"I would give her advice of just be true to who you are. Problems are going to come, challenges are going to come, but the way that you handle it is what builds character. I feel like there's always a light at the end of the tunnel and just continue to just push, push, push. If she plays basketball, I would say repetition is everything. Get the fundamentals down, just work on the little things before -- this generation is a little more flashy, but the fundamentals are everything.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, growing up I didn't like basketball at all. I just wanted to do girly stuff. I just wanted to be a ballerina and cheerleader. I didn't watch basketball growing up. But once I picked up a ball and I started to see how serious this could go, I really started tuning in a lot. I watched every WNBA basketball game. Even if I can't, I record it and then I'd go back and watch it. I don't look at the score because I like to feel like it's still live. I like that excitement.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Just L.A. as a whole, I know they weren't where they wanted to be. Championships, everyone wants a championship. I feel like I'm just excited to be a part of this journey. I feel like we're going to be really good, just looking at the roster itself. I'm just excited. I've watched them play, so I'm kind of familiar of how they like to play, their style of play.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"So that's pretty cool, and I feel like I'm going to fit in really well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yes, I'm so excited to play with Zia. It's so full circle. We grew up knowing each other. We played AAU together. We live like an hour away from each other, but that's my best friend, so we're still really close.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,But I feel like basketball is just always bringing us back together in the craziest ways. We took our four visits together coming out of high school. I'm so excited to play with my girl. I feel like this is just going to reconnect us on that deep level again.,,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm honored, honestly, that she said something like that about Cam and I. I truly believe that, as well. I feel like what Cam and I bring is just foundational, like you said. I feel like we're willing to put in the work. We're willing to do whatever as rookies. So I feel like that's pretty, pretty good, and I'm just excited to get started.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"It played a big role, knowing that we have a few athletes that have already came out of there, and to be one of them means a lot.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"To know that I'm going to such a special team with quite a few veterans means a lot.

So to be able to walk into this situation is kind of perfect for me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"The first thing I would say to them is don't allow anyone to dim your light, no matter your size. I've dealt with that all the way up until today, tonight. Other than that, I would say that no matter what happens, if you want to achieve something, you can do that.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"I want to learn from the vets as much as possible. I want to add a little bit of everything to my game. I want it to expand. I also want my IQ for the game to expand, as well.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"Yes, I can score the ball, but what else are you able to do? I think that with those guards over there, they're going to do a wonderful job of helping me.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"I'm very excited. I think that it's a full-circle moment for me. I was nominated for that Becky Hammon point guard award, I believe, three seasons in a row when I was at Buffalo. For me to have not received it and to be drafted by her when the time was right has been a full-circle moment, so I'm ready, and I'm ready to go.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Good evening, everyone. It's great to see you all here. Welcome to the 2024 WNBA Draft presented by State Farm.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Speaking of the 2024 draft class, I would be remiss not to mention the incredible excitement and energy for women's basketball that this group has helped build.

2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now, the NBA investments by those players is in independent teams, not in NBA-affiliated teams. So if you're still playing for an NBA team, you probably want to invest in the WNBA team with your affiliate, and you can't do that until you graduate, I'll call it, or retire from basketball. So we have a lot of interest from that perspective.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's great. The Bleed Blue bleeds all the way into the league. I'm just very fortunate to be given the opportunity to go to UConn and spend my four years there, but especially spend my four years there with Nika. We had a hug when my name was called. It's just a lot because the people and the relationships you build over this beautiful game that we play, it's amazing, and to share this moment with her and Coach and CD Chris Dailey and J Jamelle Elliott and Mo Morgan Valley, and Paige and Azzi were in the audience, too, it's a family.
