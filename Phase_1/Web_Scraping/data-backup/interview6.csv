2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, just like I said, just happy for me and happy how I've been sticking with it and proud of the progress I've been making."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"I talk to him here and there and I talk to him when I see him, but just want to play hard for a guy like that. So I appreciate everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"I am feeling better now. Definitely a lot better. I feel like I've almost got it out of my system, so definitely feeling a lot better than I did the last two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, man, just a couple of these meds and I'll be all right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Not much of a fever. It was more just like cold chills, body aches, heavy, heavy migraine. I was just laying down pretty much in the dark the whole entire game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Like I said, this is the time of year everybody is dealing with something, so nobody really cares what you're dealing with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I definitely can feel that. I can definitely feel it's that type of energy when I'm on the court. Just the attention of detail, that's what it takes to I feel like to get a championship at this time of year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Guys are honing in on everybody and doing whatever they can. That's on me to make adjustments and find ways to be effective, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"It feels great. Anywhere I can contribute, you know what I mean, and impact the game, I'm going to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Like I said, I might not have really been too effective offensively in the game, but at a time I needed to knock one down, I did it. This is definitely more of a series that they've got two of the best players and scorers in the league right now, so this is definitely a defensive series for me to lock in, and I'll take offense when I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Like you said, they've been preparing us for these type of moments, and just the leadership has been amazing. No matter how -- I think that's why we always feel like we have a great chance of winning these games, just because no matter how the game is going, they keep us mentally in check."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"It's hard not to listen to guys like that who's been there before. They've just been bringing great, positive energy, and we've just been feeding off that as a team, so it's been good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Definitely do. Like I said, it's a sign of respect, and I appreciate it. Like I said, it's my job to make adjustments and find ways to be effective. That's the cool thing about the Playoffs, though, is you get different looks and it definitely challenges your IQ and your adjustments. It's pretty cool."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"It's a lot more strategic than it is the regular season, so it's a different type of game and this is the type of stuff you learn from, so I'm enjoying it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think that we just grind. We just try to get it done. Kind of got like our own different style. There's a lot of different guards from different places that like to be fast, that type of stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,But I feel like we're kind of blue collar. We just try to get it done however we get it done. That's kind of what I take from it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Honesty isn't critical, so I don't view it as being critical. I think it was an honest assessment of the game. Before I came out and spoke to you guys, I had the same conversation with our players. Never once will I come into a press conference and say something to you that I haven't spoken to our team about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Our players owned it. I asked them after the game, Why did we lose tonight? And they told me we didn't play hard enough. They told me we weren't disciplined enough. It wasn't critical by any nature. It was an honest assessment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's not just one player right now. Whether it's Michael, Jamal, Aaron, Pope, Nikola, whoever, we have to be a lot more disciplined, a lot more urgent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you really want to simplify the first two games, in the first three quarters we have dominated both games. The Miami Heat are dominating the fourth quarter. They're averaging 33 points a game in the fourth quarter, shooting over 60 percent from the field in the fourth quarter and over 50 percent from three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,We're up eight going into the fourth quarter in Game 2. You're up 21 going into the fourth quarter of Game 1. They end up on a 15-2 run in the fourth quarter to take control of that game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think it's important to remind us that just because we're playing at home and we're undefeated, you just can't show up and think that's going to continue."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Coming off of a four-game sweep against the Lakers, and that was a very hard-fought sweep. They were in every game. We had to fight for every game. So you have to find a way to turn a negative into a positive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"We had a really good film session this morning. I gave an opportunity for everybody on our team to speak and talk about what they saw on the film. It was a very honest conversation. Guys owned what they needed to own. We have to learn from Game 2 to use it to our advantage, to your point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've got a great stat. I think quarters 1 through 3 after two games, we had around 19 percent of our possessions were at the end of the shot clock, last seven seconds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the fourth quarter of Game 1 and 2, that jumps from 19 percent to 32 percent. Which means we're taking the ball out of the net, we're walking it up, we're playing against the zone and we're getting caught playing in really late-clock situations, which is hurting our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Obviously what I can do is to try to help our guys defensively, because when we get stops and we get out and run, we've had control of the first three quarters two games in a row. Making sure we have the right lineups in. And offensively, just kind of giving our guys as many ways that they can attack that zone as possible where we can be effective and at least produce the right shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whether we make it or not, that's going to be on our players. But trying to make sure we're producing the right shots against that zone, which has given us some trouble in the fourth quarter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"I showed 17 clips this morning. Every clip was a discipline clip, if you will, where our discipline, whether it was game plan, whether it was personnel, whether it was defending without fouling, whatever it may be, 17 clips added up to over 40 points in Game 2. That, to me, is staggering."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"I haven't seen indecision. I've seen, once again, a lack of communication and discipline. They played zone not just in the fourth quarter, and we've been fine against it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think once that game kind of -- you allow a 15-2 run to start that fourth quarter and you've got Nikola out, you've got to get Nikola right back in. Now it becomes a different ball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"We want to play fast they want to play slow. When you're not getting stops, advantage Miami Heat because now they have their 2-2-1 press back to the zone. And as I mentioned before, we're playing way too slow to try to attack that, which is forcing a lot of late-clock situations for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"We've got a lot of guys that have been in big games, playoff tested, so I don't think any of it is our guys getting tight. I think it's just not adhering to the discipline that the game needs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah. I think being at home in general, sleeping in your bed, being able to do things at home that you're comfortable with, you know, getting home-cooked meals, all that, that benefits it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But the benefit of the crowd is no matter what, they are going to be behind you. They are going to give you energy. You know, if the other team is on the run, they are going to give you a little boost, right. If you're on a run, there's going to be a crazy boost."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I think just the overall, you know, energy for your team and your group, it will give you a little bit of a lift, but it won't win you the game because you've still got to go out there and hoop."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But it will give you some type of, you know, good feeling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I will not tell you exactly what happened, but it was a great conversation. It was just making sure that I was healthy for an opportunity, if we got on a run like we've been and I think that's the biggest thing about it, is the opportunity to be healthy, to help the group, right, no matter what it is. And you know, making it into the Finals, I'm as healthy as I've been in a while and I feel good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,It was a great conversation. It was a great time. Felt fantastic. Having a guy like Pat having your back is a good feeling. It's a good guy to have back there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, I don't. I'm being honest with you, I don't. I mean, everybody knows the basic 2-3 and traps and all that stuff. I think you learn about the zone press first as a young kid, and then you learn about the zone defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But yes, if you're getting into the question of our zone, it's pretty cool."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"It works sometimes. It's shape shifting, and I think Gabe Vincent always will say, him and Andre Iguodala kind of figured it out how to play the top and give them credit. I think give them credit, and it's just been a work in progress."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,It's a different type of zone and you have to be able to play it and want to play it to make it successful.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I love the ""oohh,"" Seven Nation Army that chant, and the Swag Surf -- that one, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I think just we have a different vibe here, you know what I mean. The vibe down here is just awesome, and when it gets going here, it's really like a party. You have to enjoy it. You enjoy the music. They sing with you. They sing along. It's just a great place to be and the fan base is unbelievable, and I'm sure tomorrow is going to be nuts in here, and I'm looking forward to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"My first year, I didn't learn much. I was around the team but I got injured. And you know, I think the second year, just playing all 82 was huge for me, coming back from injury."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think the thing about longevity is figuring out how to adapt, take care of your body, understand what an NBA season is, understanding how to train in the offseason, understanding how to eat, understanding to get your rest and recovery. Being able to adjust to who you are and grow mature-wise, right, because at the end of the day, there's going to be times where you're going to be here, and then you're going to go up and then you're going to go up, and at this point in my career, there's a lot of people that just level off. You've got to be able to have the humility to be able to say, you've got to work at different things and be willing to accept different roles and different situations at different times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Right now, at this time of the year, I'm just happy to be able to have a guy like Gabe be the starting point guard, and playing the way he's playing and being able to talk to him and help him as much as I can. That's big for me, just being able to help him, and also being a guy that can see the game from different aspects to start the game off the bench and then give him my takes and come in there and do what I can do to help the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I think last year -- I mean, I've always done it my career, and I learned it from Jason Kidd, is always try to catch the ball, look ahead. It was something I learned from Jason Kidd, watching him a long time ago."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"As a guard, it's a lot easier to catch and throw right away. I think the components -- like for Kevin Love, he has an unbelievable knack for throwing the ball right to the guy and he's bigger and you know, just right on time. He's been doing it his whole career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it's just being able -- knowing that you have confidence in your guy to go get it. We are throwing the ball to Max and Jimmy. We know they are going to get it, you know what I mean, Bam. We know those guys are going to go get it and finish it, and having the ability to have athletes like that, it makes our job a lot easier on those outlet passes. For me, it's like, sometimes you throw it -- sometimes you throw it just to throw it. It might be a turnover but you get the guys, keep running, let's try to get some relief points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, I knock on wood before I go out there and other than that -- every game is different. Got to go out there and just figure it out, different music, different clothes, different shoes. Just go out there and figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, that's a lie. Steph Curry is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,All right. I'll take that one.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Unbelievable, right. They got like a 19-handicap tour? Hes not a 19-handicap"
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, honestly, it's the way it should be, and I think that just shows how groups can get along. You kind of bring groups together that can be completely opposite and come together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,We have a team -- on our team we have guys who are complete opposite but we come together for one common goal and that's just the betterment of the game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"That was a great answer. Thanks a lot, you guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"I'm going to take the same route as we've done really the whole Playoffs. We have a belief system with this team that we can compete and win against anybody. You look down there, that's an incredibly talented team. They're big. They're physical. They pass the ball. They shoot the ball. They put you in a lot of tough positions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Like I said, our belief system is very high, and like Gabe said after the last game, we don't really care about the noise. Our position is we want to take care of business and go out there every game and compete and try to get ourselves a win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,Tomorrow we're looking to do that on our home floor.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Yeah, fifth time, definitely each and every playoff game in itself is different, but in the Finals it's such a battle of attrition, who can make the most plays, both offensively and defensively, but definitely getting here with a different team than Cleveland is different in itself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Playing in Denver, a different team that poses a ton of threats and is very well-coached, yeah, I think that every series, but certainly every Finals has posed different threats."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"This is who we are. Obviously when it's time to get down to business, our focus is all the way there during our prep, during our film session. When every coach is putting us through drills, going out there through a walk-through and obviously especially during the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,But when we're working we still like to have fun and keep it loose. It keeps us loose out there on the court starting the game and throughout 48 minutes. But it's not without intention and the willingness to do whatever it takes.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"It would be huge. He's another guy that provides so much shot making, play making ability. You saw in Game 1, we were a little bit cold from the three-point line, didn't shoot the ball particularly well from the field, so he's just one of those guys that provides so much firepower and can put a team on their heels."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"I think just being myself, unapologetically. I'm very grateful for them that they accepted me throughout the entire organization, just being myself, on the floor, off the floor. I think that helped me get acclimated."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"But also people that I've been around --I like to keep it light. I like to get to know my teammates on and off the floor personally but also professionally, see how I can best help them, uplift them and get the best out of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Everybody has their style of leadership, and getting a locker room right, I certainly have mine. But just want to be an extension of guys like UD, like Jimmy, like Bam, Kyle, players like that that provide so much not just on the floor but off."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"I've been on these guys the entire Playoffs, that good advice I got early on, kind of like we were talking about with the Finals is that every game is different, every game is going to pose its own set of problems."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Sometimes it's going to be missing shots and trying to find ways to get stops on the defensive end to keep you in the game. Sometimes you're going to blow it out and catch fire, then have to deal with another team playing in transition. Those are just a myriad of options that you might see out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"But I think that these guys have been able to wipe the slate clean, certainly after every round, but after every game they've really been just pros the entire time, and the level of perseverance and bounce back has been at a very high level with this group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think just playing basketball. I think I don't have inspiration from other athletes or whatever. I admire them and respect them, but it's a different sport. It's really cool to meet them or whatever. But I don't have any inspiration from them, if that makes any sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know that other people are saying that. I'm just trying to play the game and reading the game. Other people talk about me like that. But for me, it's just a random basketball or whatever, reading the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, the fans are really coming to the games and bringing the flags and chanting my name and just talking to me in my language. I think that's really cool, just to see how many Serbians are in the world, and they're still coming and bringing the flag and cheering for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,I think that's really nice. It's nice to play in front of them. I think that is really cool.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"We need everybody, not just him. Yes, we need to do a better job of finding him or just getting him open. That's going to help us collectively, of course. But it's not just him. We need to, as a group, be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Just as a team, they know what they want to give up or whatever. They're really intelligent, from the coach to the players. That's why the zone is so effective, not just against us it's against the whole Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sometimes we get a good look, sometimes we don't. But I think that is even in regular man-to-man sometimes you get a good shot, sometimes you don't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"They are shooting against Milwaukee 43 percent. They are shooting against Boston 40-something percent. They have good shooters, and that's why they are so deadly and dangerous, because you cannot leave them open."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, the first game Max and Caleb didn't shoot well. But we know they're going to be better. We just need to don't give them wide-open looks. They are two great shooters that at least they need to see somebody in front of them, not just a basket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I didn't realize -- I mean, when you play the game you don't think about it. You're just trying to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But yes, definitely we need to get him going. And it's not just Jamal or Mike or me or whatever. It's collectively we need to find the open man. I think the open man wins the game. We need to be better as a unit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's communication, I think, was the main word. Just to don't get them wide-open looks. Yes, we know they're going to score. Yes, we know they have talented players. But we cannot give them open looks, and that was the main key."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, we're probably going to see tomorrow, are we going to respond well or not. That's the answer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I played a little as a kid, probably was like six or seven, five, something like that. I played 2-3, down the middle most the time. I was the tallest one. Pretty much so."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"It's a little more complicated for sure once you get in the NBA, those different levels but definitely a little bit applies the same, kind of guarding your area and just talking and communicating as well. That's a big part of zone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,Zone defense gives a different look. It's definitely helpful for us.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"He's a great player and he's going to make the right play, ten times out of ten. Denver's defense loads up and tries to attack the paint."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Jimmy and Bam have a good two-man action as well, so they did a good job of playing off each other and that. So Jimmy has always been a good passer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I mean, it's not really an answer to guard Jimmy. He's a superstar player. I think the Celtics, Boston was pretty much trying to do the same thing Denver is doing put a bigger body on him, good defender."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Jimmy is going to be Jimmy. Jimmy is a good player, so he's going to do what he's got to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"My mindset is to bring energy and impact winning, whether that's scoring, whether that's defending, rebounding, play-making, doing whatever I have to do to make the hustle plays. Just try to bring energy to the game and affect the scoreboard in a positive way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,It's a part of this game for a lot of good players. I've just got to be ready when I play. I'm always going to be ready.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think we just have to play harder, truth be told, play harder and be more disciplined, and I think that'll put us in a better spot to win the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I had some Nutella French toast, some good ol' eggs and cheese, and some bacon."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"That's private, man. I can't give out all my secrets. No, but today has been a great day. I'm here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"Man, leadership, great leadership qualities. I had him as a vet when I was in OKC, and obviously with his connection through UConn, we always had great stories to go back and forth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"With his leadership, his poise, his ability to communicate with people, it's amazing. I think he'll be a perfect fit, especially with the young guys that they have there now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think he'll be able to get to them, to have good conversation with them, to get them to do what's necessary for them to turn the corner on that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think people always try to say that coaching isn't equal, but it's basketball at the end of the day. But it's all about being able to communicate and have a relationship with your players, and obviously he's had great success in doing that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think at the end of the day it's about him making the tough shot, or when he is probing and trying to make a play for his teammates that we are aware of where his team is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"Jimmy is a threat, regardless where he's at, whether he has the ball or not. He's been playing amazing these Playoffs, and whenever he has the ball or doesn't, we have to be aware of where he's at because he's able to make plays in different ways."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"We let our guard down. Our defensive presence wasn't there, especially Game 2. We allowed them to get a groove. They found things that worked for them and we didn't adjust and we didn't make plays on the defensive end to get us out on offense to try to get us easy scores."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"When the time comes. You know, lately we've had two days in between games, so that's been a time where I've just been able to get away from basketball, being around my family. I've had family come into town, my kids, my wife, and that's my opportunity to free the mind and relax a little bit and to just disengage from basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,That's been my way of recuperating the body and the mind from basketball and this long journey that we've been on.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"It's up there, man. It's top five. It gets rocking."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"I mean, you know, watching D-Wade go through his run. Watching Bronny and them go through their run. There was some iconic moments. Ray Ray Allen hitting a trey, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,Definitely feeling a little bit better. A little under the weather towards the end of that last game. Feeling better now.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"I'm extremely confident in this group of guys that have bounced back all year long. We do a good job correcting and making adjustments, and I'm excited to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, a lot of my friends from Orlando they are going to drive down and come to the game. That's nice. Florida almost feels like a second home to me. So, it's nice to be back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"No, I feel like we've had some breakdowns that are uncharacteristic of us. So, we went through film today and cleaned up some of those breakdowns, and I think it will be a different outcome."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"It's a really smart ballclub. They read the game very well. They have guys that can do a multitude of things. I mean, yeah, they make you play for an entire 24 and they make you play through 48 minutes a game. That's not usually -- that's not typical for an NBA team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"Just guarding, guarding through the entire shot clock and guarding through the entire game is going to be really important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"It's important. You've got to call a spade a spade. You've got to call it like you see it. It's the only way you're going to get better and only way you're going to make the necessary adjustments. It's about taking accountability, looking inward first and moving from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"I could have been better on defense. Not breaking down. Not letting -- you know, just sticking to the game plan a little bit better as far as like rejects or switching or low man or just the game plan discipline, knowing the personnel. Just where I can be better in that area and start there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I kiss my jersey. I kiss the front of my jersey, and the back of my jersey. I kiss -- I'm thankful for the organization and just thankful for my family as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I understand it, I would say. I wasn't pleased with Game 2 as well. The way we came out, energy and our effort, we can be a lot better. I know we can be a lot better. I've seen it, and like you say, it was different from Game 1 to Game 2. Game 1, our intensity was through the roof and in Game 2, it was nowhere to be found."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I understand where he was coming from.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We wasn't offended. As our coach, he sees on the court the effort we put out. So for me as players, I could feel that. Our effort and energy wasn't there Game 2, even though we lost by three. We didn't play at our best, and I know we can be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,We are always on the same page. We just had a little slippage in Game 2 where our miscommunication or our communication was bad. So we just got to be a little better in areas and be locked in.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I would say just be a little bit more aggressive, and I know they got the same amount of open shots they got Game 1 and Game 2, but Game 2, they knocked them down, so just -- I feel like be a little bit more aggressive and try to limit them threes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Not too concerned. Got to be solid. Stay in front of Jimmy. We know he's a great play-maker and great scorer. Just got to be solid and give him different looks and be aggressive. Just get the ball out of his hands, whatever it takes. Do my job for my team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"They have been the No. 1 three-point shooting team in the playoffs. They have got great shooters on their team. For us, we've just got to limit the shot attempts and try to not let them see the ball go in the basket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, Bam has been playing incredibly well this entire Playoffs, for sure this series, and that's when he's got like the toughest matchup by far on the defensive side of the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,He plays with so much energy. He never takes a possession or a play off. You've got to really respect him for that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Then on the offensive end, he is doing everything for us. We need him to continue to be that. He has been there for us all year long, and like I said, he is going to be the reason why we win the championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know, but I'm grateful for Tyler Junior College. Taught me a lot about the game of basketball. I had so much belief in myself. Not to say that I would be up here talking to y'all in the Finals, but I just knew I could be a really good basketball player, maybe make a little bit of money doing basketball overseas."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"They taught me a lot at Tyler Junior College about the game of basketball. And then, go to Marquette for three years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think JUCO just so happened to be like the best thing for me. I couldn't tell you that at the time. I was frustrated that I wasn't playing Division I basketball, but my goodness, I've got so much love for Tyler Junior College."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's always a blessing to play in the Finals, for sure, like in front of a heckling away crowd. But I'm so happy for the city of Miami, this organization. They deserve to be in the Finals. They deserve to win the Finals and win a championship. We will do everything in our power to make that happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I just know that the energy in there is going to be unmatched. It has been throughout this entire Playoffs run, and even in the regular season. I know they're going to show up. I know they're going to show out. I know we're going to do the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,I don't know. I don't have too many bad things to say about any organization or any player that I've played with. I know that the guys that we have here fit that mold to the T. Everything that they do here is about winning. It's not about anything else.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"So we ride with that. We think about that. Nobody really thinks about the past or where they have been, or the future where they might be. I think the best part about this squad, this time, is we're in it for right now, every single day, and that's what the Heat culture is about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, everybody, everybody that walks through this door or a part of this organization, past, present, for sure the future, you have to buy in to everything that we're about here, which is about one another, not about you, and about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If you can do that, you can handle all of that, you're going to flourish here. Each one of the guys on this roster, everybody in this organization, front office, all the way down the line, it's about somebody else, and it's always about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know. It's just winning basketball. We just happen to win, and it looks like we're playing good in the fourth quarter. I can't tell you the answer to that question. I wish that wasn't even a thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know if anybody knows that except for you. We definitely don't know that. We just want to win. I'm telling you, we just want to win, and if it happens to be coming back in the fourth quarter, then that's what it is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If it happens to be holding a lead in the fourth quarter, I pray that that's what it is. At the end of the day, we've just got to find a way to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think I've done great. I think I've done what I've needed to do to get us to 1-1. I hope it was 2-0 in our favor it is not. I don't pay attention to stats. Not going to lie, I've said that all along. As long as we win, everybody is playing great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If we lose, and I hope we don't do that too often, everybody can blame me for whatever reason. I'm not worried about it. But nobody can blame anybody for anything whenever we win. That's all that we focus on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"He is one of the heads of the snake. I think it's a two-headed snake in this instance. Bam has a really tough job to do. I think time and time again, I have a tough job on Murray. He scores in so many different ways. He has the ball consistently and he is making all the right reads, all the right passes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"But it's just about effort, contesting every shot, body on body, making everything difficult for him. I've got to continually do that because I know if I lead the way on that end along with Bam, everybody has to follow suit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's all about doing your job, doing what is asked of you on any given night and hoping, praying that you did enough to get a win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, I think it changes from series to series, maybe even game to game. If my guys are open, I'm throwing it every single time. I hope I throw it on the money perfect to where you can just step in and shoot it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Like I've always said, I've got so much faith in them. I can't win without them. I've tried that before in other places where I just think I can do it. No, that's not the answer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Here, we understand that I need those guys. I hope those guys need me a little bit, too. But it's like, it's perfect basketball. We love playing for and with one another. If you're open, I'm passing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. I'm not a scorer. Just because I score a lot of points one game, that doesn't make you a scorer. I'm not a volume shooter. I don't do any of that. I don't press to score. I only press to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If I pass the ball every possession, if we win, I don't care. If I shoot the ball every possession and we win, I don't care. This Playoff Jimmy narrative is not a thing. I just want to win along with everybody else. I don't worry about too much other things aside from winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's always D-Wade just telling me to be myself and be who I am, create my own story and go out there and compete and do what you love to do, and that's win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"He's been in my corner for a very long time now. I'm very grateful. He is a huge reason why I'm here. I don't like to be compared to that guy, but the one thing that I do want to be like him is a champion. That's what I've got to go do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"I didn't come much. I came once when they played Philly in the playoffs. I think T.J., Tyler Johnson, was still here. But we also played here during the Hoop Hall. We played Princeton here my sophomore year. But I mean, I love this arena. It's a great arena."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"No, he never introduced me to them. But I did have a Heat meeting during the Draft Combine, but I don't remember much about it. But I think I did."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,No one yet but hopefully soon I get to see everyone.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,Definitely Coach L. I might go back to campus and see the new dorms. I was there last summer working out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,Am I surprised? No. Coach L. is a great coach. He gets great players to come in. They all buy into his system. They want to win. He gets winners to come in and play extremely hard. So not surprising.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"Each year, I think their goal is to win a National Championship. They have the players to do that. So, I can't wait till next year to start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"No, I don't think so."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"It means a lot. We were in Pinecrest yesterday at Jeff Green's house at a team dinner and we drove by UM. It just brought back memories, me going to the McDonald's across the street on U.S. 1 and being in the CVS a lot. It's great to be back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think we agree with what Coach said. You can't lose an NBA Finals game because of effort. We've got to bounce back effort-wise. I think we only lost the game by three points, so we're right there in a game where we didn't play well at all, and it's back-to-back games where I think the team agrees we haven't played well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,So we've just got to bounce back.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They did a lot of the same stuff, but we just messed up on our end, and I think that's the best part about it, is there's a lot of controllable things and a lot of things that we can fix."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"If it was something that they did that we just couldn't handle it would be a different story, but we lost by three in a game where we made a lot of mistakes on our end, so definitely controllable, and we'll bounce back in Game 3."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Lets Nikola score in the middle of the zone. If they want to mix it up, they're going to do what they do, but I think the biggest part is just controlling what we do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"And I think that's why we lost the last game. We didn't control what was controllable for us and we didn't play hard enough. Jamal can score on anybody, and our offense is good enough where anybody can get looks. And I think we got a lot of good looks the last game, they just didn't go in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think, like you said, we made a lot of mistakes on our end, and I think both games we felt like we haven't played that well, so we've just got to bounce back and do what we do really well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They had a lot of good and open shots in the fourth quarter, so got to take some of those away, and a lot of it's just communication."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, like I said, a lot of it is communication and stuff that we can control. Something that we will fix. We've been better with that stuff throughout the whole game. Like I said, back-to-back games we haven't played well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"To lose by only three in a game where we thought we didn't play very well, it's definitely encouraging, and we'll play a lot better next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think that might be something that we needed last game, to lose a close game with a lot of things that we can fix."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So we feel like we're definitely in the right spot, fixing things that we need to fix. We'll shoot better obviously going forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"But control what we can control, just be who we are. I don't think it matters home or away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"Best advice I've gotten? I think it was in the bubble. In the bubble, D-Wade called UD on FaceTime. I was in the room, obviously. He was like, hey, man, let me talk to young fella. He said the biggest things about the Finals is really embrace and cherish the moment because they do not come around often."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"It's not one of those things where you're like, all right, I'll just get here next year, because it's not that easy. Teams change, players change, coaches change. So really embrace that moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,I would say Duncan has definitely evolved into he can put the basketball on the floor now. He feels comfortable doing that. He feels comfortable making plays for other people.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"Obviously, he is one of the best shooters in the league when he ignites, when he gets on fire. It's hard to stop Duncan Robinson."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like the best thing about Kevin Love's passing is it's always on the money. They're always right there. Hands ready, it's in the pocket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"My biggest change would be on a team with K-Love, as you can see, as soon as he gets the rebound, I take off running. I feel like we've all benefited from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He's been to how many Finals at this point? So he has seen everything but the win. Him being in those moments, him cherishing those moments, I feel like he is comfortable here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He isn't making anything up. He isn't trying to figure it out, this, that and the third. He has been through so much with so many other great players that I feel like he settles in in these moments. This is when he really gets comfortable. This is when he doesn't really get really rattled. This is when he comes up with the game plan for us to be successful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"We both have something on the line, which is a championship. Obviously, it's going to be a fight. He is a great player. He is a two-time MVP, and you respect that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"You treat it like you're the only man in the arena. You take your time, inhale, exhale and then you go back to all them times you had to shoot free throws after running suicides, running 10s, being dog tired after practice having to make free throws. You just go back to those moments, and then it gives you that sort of confidence, like oh, I've been here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,You go to the line and knock them down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"I'm expecting it to be, every time we make a layup, free throw, there to be an avalanche of noise. And obviously when we get stops."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"For us, we've seen what this city looks like when it's been in the Finals. So it's good to have the opportunity to be back in front of these fans and have this opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He can go through two or three coverages and figure it out in a matter of, up and down, up and down. He's already read the game, reading the game. So the biggest thing for us is switching up the coverages and having him see different looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"The biggest thing for us guarding him is just make him take difficult shots. We're not just going to just let a man go get 40. That's just not smart by any means, especially when you're guarding a guy who has been the two-time MVP of this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"Biggest thing for us is force everybody on the team into tough shots, and you live with that result. Going into the intensity part, it's good to be in our environment. It's good to be in the 305 and have the crowd on our side."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"It doesn't. My thing in the pick-and-roll is to make sure that the guard gets open, so set a great screen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He takes the challenge. Whatever the assignment is, I feel like he'll take the challenge. He's going to find a way to make it tough on him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,Biggest thing for us is having a guy like that that is willing to take the challenge on defense and also be the No. 1 option on offense.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"One, we have incredible experience on our team. We have veterans who have run 2-3, 3-2, 1-3-1, whatever that may be. And then also, we drill it to nausea, to the point where we're tired of it. But we also have that in our back pocket just in case we need it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I don't think so. I'd say no just because Jokic switches up what he does in pick-and-roll a lot. You know, they kind of keep you thinking, so I'm just trying to be aggressive and find my spots when I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"Duncan came in and was a huge spark for us. He's ignitable. We have a number of guys that are like that, but he does it in a special way. And, you know, when he starts cutting to the rim and finishing at the basket, it helps a lot, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think it was the result of 48 minutes of doing it. You know, we just had to work the game, and we'll continue to do so and just try to continue to play good basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"It's just part of our DNA, for one. You know, everyone on this team has battled through adversity in some manner and been knocked down and had to get back up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"And for number two, we have a lot of experience in these close games. So when it comes down to the wire, we are strangely comfortable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I think that everyone that's got a jersey on is willing to give in to whatever we need to try to help us get a win. I think that helps a lot, whether it's Kevin and Caleb or Max or Duncan or myself or Kyle. You go down the roster, and guys are just willing to give in, and I think that's huge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I think Spo said it well. It's hard to sum it up. Bam's been great. He's been relentless. He's got a tall task, obviously, matching up with Jokic, and we still rely on him and turn to him to do a number of things on us for both sides of the ball and he's been stepping up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I think just in general, we just competed harder today. I don't know if it was any direct scheme or direct thing we did outside of just being a little more intentional and a little more focused and playing just a bit harder. Playing a little -- just competing a little bit more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"It definitely wasn't easy. The staff was great with me, whether it was film or getting in the gym, and my teammates have been phenomenal, coaching me up, telling me to be more aggressive when I'm questioning it or trying to think, should I pass first."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"And our stars, Jimmy, Kyle, Bam, they have just been in my ear and telling me just to play, play basketball. They trust my IQ of the game, and they want me just to go out there and play hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"It's going to be a different game entirely. I think every game will be different this series, especially, and it will be great to be back home to start with, be back in front of our fans, it will be an awesome environment, great experience. It's going to be a battle. They are going to bring everything they got and we'd better do the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I cannot confirm that, nor will I. I think that's Jared Greenberg and Charles Barkley coming up with this, but look, I'm still waiting to officially get word that Caleb and Gabe are going, although it'll take a lot to have them sit out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Then I'll just figure out my official lineup in the next hour or so.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I think it's okay to give you a little bit of that info."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yes, he is progressing. We're really encouraged by the progress. He started doing contact work as soon as we got to Denver."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have to maintain perspective. We want to be responsible about this. We're all excited and encouraged by his progress, but we'll get back to Miami. All we're doing is sticking to the process, trying to stack positive days, also understanding this is not trying to return to a game in December. This is the Finals. So, there is a little bit of context to this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I think I mentioned this the other day. When I grew up in the Portland Trail Blazer family, organizations were so much smaller, so it was the Adelman kids and the Spoelstras running around and there weren't a ton of other kids."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,He's probably had as much of an impact and inspiration for me to get into coaching as anybody. I had never even thought about it before that. I feel like I grew up in the Adelmans' household. R.J. and I were very close. All the kids were very close. Kathy and I went to college together. I knew David since he was super small.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But that was the first time that I saw what NBA coaching was all about, even though I grew up and Jack Ramsay was our coach. I was younger at that time, and then when you're a teenager, all you're thinking about is you want to play. You're not thinking about being an old crusty coach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I had every intention to play him in Game 1, and things just kind of went a bunch of different ways. Nothing seemed to look right, including my decision making."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But yes, he brings that veteran decorated playoff championship-level experience, and you can't really quantify what that means except for that he's been here, he can infuse a bunch of confidence in the guys, and he just has a timeliness of his winning plays. He's a tough competitor, and he's had some really important moments in this playoff run."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I guess that kind of sums it up, especially when you play on a team like this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I think that's the balance that everybody is trying to search for in the Playoffs. You start to face the better defenses in the league, in the Playoffs, and then you -- I feel like every team is trying to generate easier looks, so you get to a certain point in the series you're trying to find relief points in the open court, and you're weighing crashing the glass versus getting back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I guess we've faced some of the better running teams in the East so far, so we have kind of that urgency with that, but Denver is unique. They also do it in a little bit of a different way. We managed that okay in Game 1, but it's a big part of their game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Probably like any coach. We're masochistic, so yeah, it's not very unique to me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't totally remember. I think we were talking about some schematics. It was more about that. This is complex. Basically every other huddle we're talking about what it's going to require and all those extra efforts and physical plays without fouling, just making winning plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But I think at that time, we were talking about some schematics. That's a really good offensive team. They force you to have to compete at a super-high level, but you have to do it with a brain and you have to do it with discipline."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And our guys, regardless of how the head coach feels, during the fourth quarter, our guys love to compete. They love to put themselves out there in those moments of truth. Fortunately we were able to make a lot of big defensive plays down the stretch, and then we got a lot of contributions, which you're going to need against a team like this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Some of that run happened with J.B. on the bench. Their run in the second quarter happened with Jokic on the bench. Duncan's minutes were really good. Kyle just has this veteran championship experience that just kind of settles everybody, and he just makes the big, appropriate plays, our big plays at the appropriate times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And then Bam, we just can't say enough of how difficult his responsibilities are in this series. To take arguably the toughest cover in the league for all the myriad of reasons that I don't need to get into, and then he has to shoulder a big offensive role for us, as well. So it's not like he can just stand and rest on the offensive side, and yes, he has to play 40-plus minutes, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"More intentional. And that doesn't guarantee you anything either, but at least you give yourself the best chance. That the ball is going where it needs to go and everybody understands what we are trying to get accomplished. Then you have to trust. You have to trust each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So we did get some relief points on cuts and extra passes, ball movement that led to open shots. Yes, it always looks better if the ball goes in. But our guys are competitors. They love those kinds of moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Well, we've talked about it in all the previous three series, so I feel like I'm being redundant. We faced a lot of adversity during the season. We handled it the right way where you are not making excuses about it, the injuries, the changes lineups. Because of all that adversity and the 57 close games that happened, due to a lot of that, it hardened us. It steeled us and we developed some grit, which is what we all want."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We want to be able to have that privilege of having adversity and being able to overcome it. You gain strength from that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But this is a very tough opponent. They have our full respect, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Of course, everybody is going to be looking at that final number How many threes did he hit? But he's a winning basketball player. He does winning things defensively. He's physical, he's in the right spots, he's a great block-out guy. He's also a guy that will come in and help rebound. If you give him a task, he'll do it, and that's winning basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Offensively, yeah, it's always great to see the ball go in. But Max has also proven that he can impact winning regardless of whether the ball is going in. He puts in more time than he probably should. He's a masochist, like all of us. He's always going to put in the time. He's ignitable. And we needed every bit of what he did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't even know how to answer that. It's not about me. This group, we have faced tough times this year. So we have learned how to handle setbacks, things not going our way and just getting to work instead of getting distracted or making excuses or feeling sorry for ourselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It's like a muscle that you work on and you get better. We've had more experience at this than anybody else in the league. We've had a lot of crushing losses during the regular season.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we love Nnamdi. We really do. If you don't know that, the national media, because you're not following us, please look that up, Nnamdi. He's a special guy. He really is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He was with us in the bubble as a two-way guy. He took on I think the toughest role change for a young player. He was a gunslinger, 2-guard. We wanted to develop him into a combo guard, somebody that could organize us, be an irritant defensively, tough, learn how to facilitate and run a team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think that's the toughest thing to do in this league, is turn a 2 into a 1. He openly just embraced that. Then he struggled at times with that because you're trying to reinvent yourself. Instead of saying, This is too tough, let me be me, he's really grown the last three years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He's just an incredible winning player. This year, he's been a starter for us. He's been great. He's off the bench, he's been great. He's like a lot of our guys, the competitive spirit. You get challenged like we're getting challenged in this series, you hope it brings out the best in you. And that's what it's doing with him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Are you talking about Nnamdi, Gabe? I would say that old saying that we use a lot People severely overestimate what you can get accomplished in a day, and they grossly underestimate what you can get accomplished in a matter of months, years, when nobody is paying attention. And he's the epitome of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We had to make an adjustment in that Boston series, and that really was necessary and it worked. Then we're facing a new opponent that we don't really know, and so we just went with what finished that previous series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But we have been 10-4, 11-4 now with this lineup. Clearly we needed that size and veteran experience and physicality that K-Love brings. I don't know how many minutes -- I don't have my glasses, so I don't know the stats -- but that veteran experience, the dedicated championship-level experience that K-Love and Kyle both brought tonight, there's not an analytic that can show you how valuable that was."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, that's a ridiculous -- that's the untrained eye that says something like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This guy is an incredible player. You know, twice in two seasons he's been the best player on this planet. You can't just say, Oh, make him a scorer. That's not how they play. They have so many different actions that just get you compromised."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have to focus on what we do. We try to do things the hard way, and he requires you to do many things the hard way. He has our full respect."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I mean, Bam is the heart and soul of what we are doing at both ends. Sets the tone for us defensively with his versatility, and just making it difficult, usually on a team's best player, a lot of times, especially in this series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And then offensively, you know, he does a lot. Gets people open. A lot of stuff that doesn't show up in box scores screens, assists, all that sort of stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And also when he's aggressive, it's usually when we're at our best. He's been huge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, first off, just kind of having an approach and a disposition to not kind of just let them take me out of what we're trying to do. So that's a start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And also, just kind of doing it with a brain, as well, and, you know, not just going out there mindlessly and just trying to run off a hand-off but instead being a little more patient, a little more thoughtful with it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,So was able to get open in large part because of good screens and good passing.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, nothing that really sticks out. We got a lot of belief as a group. And to be honest, we liked the flow of the game and how it was going. And the fact that it was -- we felt like at times we really had it on our terms and we're kind of making it difficult for them. You know, that's important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But we knew they were a really good team, and we just needed to come out with a sense of urgency in that fourth. It was kind of like a now or never sort of thing. Started with the defense, obviously, and we were able to do some things from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, just not always running to the ball. Just trying to be a little more creative. Something I've been working on for a little while now. It's a development thing. It's taken time to get to that point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But, you know, it makes it easier when you have got guys that can find you in those situations because the cut is one thing, but the pass is really what makes it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I had not done much in the first game and then the first half of this game, we talk a lot about trying not to have empty minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,So just trying to play with a certain level of aggressiveness on offense just to at least be out there and have my presence felt.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Obviously, it helps when the ball goes in, which you can't always control. But, you know, just really about taking the right shots and just being aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, for sure. You know, Max coming out like that was huge. And to be honest with you, we expected it. We know how great of a shooter he is. And, you know, when he came out and hit those shots early, I think it settled everyone a little bit. And from there, it's just about continuing to chip away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,So we've got a lot of belief in everybody that can step up and make shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,I surprised myself with the fact that I pulled that one out. That was not premeditated at all. That was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"To be honest, I don't get a lot of moments in the season to break that one out so when you get one, you've got to try to take advantage of it, I guess."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Mostly just try to play with a certain level of joy. I feel like I play my best when I'm having fun, and I'm always going to try to be respectful with it but having fun and enjoying just this stage. This is an incredible stage to be on as a player. That is when you dream about, so it doesn't make any sense to get here and not enjoy it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It's certainly gratifying. Gives you a newfound perspective and appreciation just for opportunity and this journey, understanding that you kind of go through stretches where you're going to have challenges and you're going to have to deal with adversity and overcome it. It's not always storybook in that sense and you don't always get when you want, and just kind of learning how to deal with that and push through that, I think obviously it makes moments like this more enjoyable but I think it also just makes you more grateful to have opportunities on this stage. Try not to take it for granted and yeah, you know, just go out there and enjoy myself and have fun and try to help this team win games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, he's a really good defender. Comes in and sets the tone with his speed and physicality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"There's going to be adjustments both ways. As an offensive player, you have to adapt, and he's got to do the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"So just kind of continuing to learn and grow as you kind of gain experience throughout the series, but at the same time, always try to fall on the side of being aggressive and flying up at things and making shots because that's what my team needs me to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. They just played hard, and like I said, it was more discipline. It's defeating when you're giving up mistake after mistake, and it's not them beating you, you're giving them open dunks or open shots. That's tough to come back from. We've just got to stay together and look ahead."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, I don't think it has anything to do with that. It's defense and discipline. Like I said, we've just got to have an all-around game. We can't just have spurts of second quarter good, end of the third good. We can't have spurts of good play. We've got to play all the way through, through ups and downs, stay together and play with intensity and energy, and I don't think we had that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"We just piled them on, mistake after mistake, and weren't able to come back from that. Even when we were up, it felt like we were trying to climb back into the game just energy-wise and intensity-wise."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I mean, I think you guys have seen me hit that shot enough. It was a good look, just didn't go down."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"If we play like that, then we expect to lose like that, yeah. We can't play like that, so if we play away, home, on the road, doesn't matter. We've got to have a better showing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. He had 41 points. He's doing a lot. Yeah, he played a great game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"We've talked about knowing he's going to come back at some point in this series. Hasn't played since Game 1 of that Milwaukee series. He's been out for a while. We know what kind of talent he is. His ability to play off the bounce, create for himself, create for his teammates and obviously shoot the three ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"If and when he becomes available, our guys will be ready, from a personnel standpoint and a game plan standpoint. We understand this is Game 2, he is out and we're going to see a much different Miami Heat team than we did on Thursday night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, if we give them as many open threes, maybe. That's the thing no one is talking about. They didn't get to the foul line a lot, and we gave them a ton of open looks from three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, I'm not banking on the Miami Heat getting two free-throw attempts tonight. We knew that without hearing anything they said, but then you listen to their comments yesterday, and whether it was Jimmy or anybody else on their roster, they know they're going to have to play more aggressive, attacking the basket, putting pressure on the rim."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's why your attention to detail and your KYP Know Your Personnel discipline come into play. You've got to stay down on shot fakes. You've got to show your hands and try to limit that. Because when they get to the foul line, that's when they control the tempo and can implement their defensive game plan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, eight years is a long time. You look at the steady improvements on that end of the floor, and this year I think with about maybe three weeks to go in the season, we were right on the edge of top 10, and then we did not finish the regular season off very well and we dropped down to 15. But I knew full well that when we were locked in, this team could step up and defend at a high level. I believe we finished third in the regular season in clutch defensive rating. So when the game was on the line, they proved night in and night out they could go out and get timely stops in close games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Very proud of the buy-in, the commitment. When you add guys like KCP, a guy like Bruce Brown and then guys like Michael, Nikola and Jamal just continuing to evolve and improve on that end, and then you've got a guy like Aaron Gordon, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"The guys understood for us to win a championship this year, we'd have to make improvements on defense. I think in these Playoffs, we've done that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think -- and you know this because you've been with us the whole year -- I feel really, really fortunate to have veterans like Ish, like DeAndre, Jeff and KCP, guys that have been around the block a few times. When you can have veterans that are truly selfless and not worried about hey, I'm not in the playoff rotation, but they're still invested in the team and the team's success and they're willing to use their voice in a positive manner, that is really impactful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Ish has always great things to say. He has the respect of our locker room, as do all the other veterans I mentioned. They've had an impact. Even without playing many minutes in these Playoffs, they have had a real impact on our team, our culture and the locker room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, you look back to his rookie year, he's always been kind of a lighthearted, funny -- I think as the years have gone on, he's definitely matured, grown up. I'm sure being a father, being a husband has helped that. Not that he was immature. I'm not saying he was just goofing off all the time. But he has a great personality. He doesn't take himself too serious."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Going on the road up 2-0, you know that you've maintained your home-court advantage and you're going into the opposing team's arena with a 2-0 lead, and the pressure squarely on them as you go on the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But for us, we're just worried about tonight. We're not worried about going down to Miami, Game 3, Game 4. This is truly a one game, one quarter at a time mindset. We've done a great job at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But once again, I don't think we played great in Game 1. They didn't play great in Game 1. I expect both teams to play a hell of a lot better tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think you have to mix it up. This time of the year, we can't give them a steady diet of one thing. I think we have to read flow of the game, time and score. You have to read personnel, who is involved in the pick-and-roll with Bam, and then give them different looks. We gave up four pull-up threes in Game 1, three to Kyle Lowry, one to Gabe Vincent. Bam in the pocket is not only a lethal scorer in that mid-range, but he's also a very good playmaker. You have guys like Jimmy Butler and Haywood Highsmith cutting behind the defense, what we would call a ghost cut, and really putting a lot of pressure on the rim and your low man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's definitely a challenge. But as long as we're contesting all those shots and adhering to the game plan with discipline, hopefully the results will be in our favor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I'm getting it from my assistant coaches. I'm not sitting there reading the ticker. But we meet a lot, we talk a lot. When an opposing team only has two free throw attempts as a team and Jimmy Butler, who was third in the Playoffs coming into this series at 9.1 per game and he gets zero, it's just common sense that they're going to be a hell of a lot more aggressive, understanding that they have to get there more than two times a game, because that's who they've been. I think Game 1 obviously was not who we've seen from the Miami Heat throughout these Eastern Conference Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's one thing, without hearing them, we knew already that they were going to be a lot more aggressive because that's what every team tends to do in these Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I don't think that's the biggest question."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Let's talk about effort. This is NBA Finals, we are talking about effort that's a huge concern of mine. You guys probably thought I was just making up some storyline after Game 1 when I said we didn't play well. We didn't play well. Tonight, the starting lineup to start the game, it was 10-2 Miami. Start of the third quarter, they scored 11 points in two minutes and 10 seconds. We had guys out there that were just whether feeling sorry for themselves for not making shots or thinking they can just turn it on or off, this is not the preseason, this is not the regular season. This is the NBA Finals. That to me is really, really perplexing, disappointing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I asked the team, I asked them, you guys tell me why they lost, and they knew the answer. Miami came in here and outworked us, and we were by far our least disciplined game of these 16 or 17 playoff games, whatever it is now. So many breakdowns. They exploited every one of our breakdowns and scored. If we're going to try to go down there and regain control of this series and get home-court advantage back, we're going to have to outwork Miami, which we didn't do tonight, and our discipline is going to have to be off the charts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Oh, there's no maybe. There was miscommunication, game-plan breakdowns, personnel breakdowns. There were guys like Max Strus -- I said it after Game 1, he's 0-for-9 in Game 1, you know he's going to make shots. He got off to a really hot start tonight. Cooled down a little bit. He gets 10 threes off, Gabe Vincent six off, Kevin Love gets six off, Duncan Robinson three off. Those are guys that we are supposed to have a heightened awareness to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"As I mentioned after Game 1, the fact that they got 16 wide-open threes was concerning. They didn't make them. So, we got lucky in Game 1. Tonight, they made them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"So, it was definitely a breakdown in communication. It was definitely a breakdown in our game plan, and like I said, we just were not nearly as disciplined as you need to be in the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I'd have to watch the film. Give them credit, they played with tremendous pace, and they never let up. So, we've got to make sure we're doing a better job of getting our energy up and not letting them outwork us and create separation and kind of put us in a spin cycle, which they did quite a few times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Fourth quarter defense, I thought for three quarters tonight actually the defense was pretty good. I believe going into the fourth quarter they were shooting 43 percent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But in the fourth quarter, you give up 36 points on 69 percent from the field. That's not going to cut it. That's not going to cut it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought the way Nikola closed that third quarter was tremendous. Kind of got us a little bit of rhythm going into that fourth quarter, gave us a little bit of breathing room and then they started the fourth quarter 13-2. To me the wheels really fell off to start that fourth quarter. They were getting whatever they wanted, threes, layups, and that allowed them once again to sit back in their zone offense, slow the game down, and we had a hard time getting stops, and then we had a hard time getting made baskets on the other end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Our defense has to be a hell of a lot better. That's two fourth quarters, Game 1 and Game 2, where our fourth-quarter defense has been nonexistent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, you have to understand who you're guarding, KYP know your personnel discipline. So, if you're guarding a Duncan Robinson, a Gabe Vincent, a Kevin Love, a Max Strus, you have to guard them at the four-point line. I believe, talking about lack of discipline, I think we fouled at least three jump shooters tonight, then you have to have the discipline to contest without fouling -- getting a hand up, giving them a place to land, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Jamal had a great look at the end. I told our guys, if we would have won this game tonight, we would have stole one, and it didn't happen. The shot didn't go in, and we lose by three points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, the three-point line is a huge concern coming in, the No. 1 three-point shooting team in these Playoffs and did a decent job in Game 1 by the numbers, but tonight they buried us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one, I think the altitude, too much is made of that. I think -- Miami has been here for probably like a week now, so they're acclimated. So, I really don't think that's the reason why we've won games at home. I think our players deserve credit. Our fans deserve credit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, they came out in that fourth quarter with a huge sense of desperation, and we didn't match that. Once again, 13-2 start, they kind of take control of the game, and just our inability or unwillingness to get stops and have a defensive mindset in the fourth quarter was very problematic. Again, the numbers speak for themselves -- 36 points in the fourth quarter on 69 percent is going to make it really hard to win a game in the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think it's dependent upon the situation. Their half-court defense was giving us a lot of trouble in that fourth quarter, and you take a timeout, you let them get set, you let them review whatever play they think we're going to run, and there's a great chance that we don't get a quality shot like Jamal got, which was on line, and from my perspective, looked like it had a great chance of going in, and we've seen Jamal make shots like that before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Some nights, yeah, we can take the timeout. Other nights give our guys the freedom to get out and run. But with how well they were guarding in that fourth quarter and how hard it was for us to generate great looks, I felt in that transition we were going to have the best chance to get the look that we wanted."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, probably a combination. We have to give them credit. We scored 108 points, 52 percent from the field, 14 turnovers for 19 points. That's a concern in the fourth quarter, 4-for-10. But I trust Nikola. He's going to read the game. He's going to read how he's being guarded, and he's also going to pick his spots where he knows regardless of how he's being guarded, we need him to score and be aggressive and look to score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whether it's 41 points, only four assists, or it's 25 points and 15 assists, Nikola, one thing I trust about him is he's going to make the right read time and time again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"Yeah, we felt like last game obviously was a tough shooting night for us. Guys that typically at the very least hit a few more shots, it just wasnt here for us in Game 1. I love seeing Max, Gabe, Duncan and Caleb, all of those guys stepping up and shooting the ball with confidence. It was a beautiful thing to see. Getting off to that hot start and consistent, fluid start for us was great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"Its going to be a hard-fought series. They say the series starts when an away team wins, and now it becomes a best-of-five. But now we get to go back home with the series split. So we can tip our hats to that and feel good about that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"I love it, man. He can be one of those guys who just breaks a game open. Weve seen that from him throughout these playoffs. His consistency and confidence has been there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,Its so hard to game-plan for him. Hes such basketball savant. Hes brilliant out there. Youre never going to stop him you just try to slow him down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"If you take some of the passes away, hes going to go score. You try to take that away and send a double team, hes going to pass the ball. Hes going to bury you under the hoop if you switch. Hes just so smart that, you just try to make it tough on him and take the other X factors out of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,Slow Murray down as well. They get to that pick-and-roll that is so devastating. Probably the most devastating one-two punch in the league. Thats why theyre here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"We know were going to have our hands full for the rest of the series. At least for tonight, getting that win was huge for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"Hes a huge factor. Michael Malone is a hell of a coach too. But Coach Spo, having been here and having a storied and decorated career, its a beautiful thing to have him on that sideline."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"That trust works both ways with us. Its a beautiful thing. You look over there during timeouts, halftime, pregame, prep, all that stuff is a ten out of ten with our coaching staff and Coach Spo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, yes, of course that cannot be a question. But we just didn't play well, the right way in the fourth quarter. They scored 36 points in the fourth quarter. That's too much, of course. They got a couple of rebounds. It was just -- happened to be like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we didn't want it to happen, of course, but it happened, so we're going to live with it. We are going to Miami to play another game, so..."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't think about assists or whatever. To be honest, I don't know the answer. I was just playing, and I don't think when I'm playing about stats or whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, just you need to know what to do. We had a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding. They were getting open looks, especially at the beginning of the game, and we have a couple at the end of the game, too. You just need to know where to be or what to do or what's the coverage or whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"The first game, I think we had -- I said I missed mid-range shot, Jamal missed mid-range shot and Mike missed a corner three. I think those are shots that we want and we didn't make those, and today they just put us in their rhythm, and we didn't want to play that way, and they want to, obviously. But maybe just to play a little bit faster is going to help us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Of course, they have a really good team and really good players, and we need to adjust, so it depends of the skill set of the player. Sometimes we are up, sometimes we are down the floor. I think everybody is doing that in the league. We just need to be there early and then make an extra effort, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, just a good stretch, of course. Seems like I just got going and I was just trying to score. Simple as that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course they scored 17 threes, they shoot 48 percent, which is really, really good, of course. Just I think be disciplined, just if somebody is running, run him off -- I think the discipline is the key for us. If you are not disciplined, if we're going to have a breakdown, it's not going to be a long series, of course. Just because they are punishing you as soon as you make mistakes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,Hopefully we're going to be disciplined for next game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,I don't -- can I not answer this question? Next question.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we know that that's not going to happen. Of course, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and especially in the Playoffs where every game is different, every game matters, which is normal. We didn't want to lose, but we lost. So hopefully we're going to go there and win the next one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"Yeah. It's the expletive Finals, man. Our energy has to be better. We can't come out like we did, and we have to be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"I think it's all about discipline. We just have to be better disciplined on the ball, off the ball, knowing our coverages, knowing what we're supposed to do, playing without fouling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"Nothing needs to be said at this point. I think we understand, especially after tonight, how we need to be. Like I said, it's the Finals. I don't think we need a rah-rah speech in order to get us up. I think we know what we have to do going into Game 3."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"No. I think he did what he was supposed to do. When he had to be aggressive, he was aggressive. He makes the right play, and he sees the floor very well. I don't think what they did took him out of him getting assists."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"If he's going to be aggressive like that, other guys can figure out how to be effective on the court. It's not about us just waiting around trying to get Joker to figure out how to get us the ball. We have to figure out how to be aggressive. It starts with the defensive end and then we carry that over to the offensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"They made shots. We didn't turn them over like we did in that first stretch, and that was the tale of those two halves. We didn't get the stops that we did. We didn't put the pressure on them. We wasn't aggressive enough on the defensive end, and we allowed them to get a groove, and that carried on to the fourth quarter, and that's how they got the win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"No, I think it's the defense that impacted the offense. We allowed them to get comfortable, easy looks. Like I said, our discipline wasn't as great. Fouling jump shooters, allowing easy cuts. We wasn't ourselves tonight. Our communication has to be way better going into Game 3, and I think that was the reason they got into the lead."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"Well, I mean, we've won on the road before. I think we understand what's at stake. They did what they were supposed to do. They came in here, got a split. Now they're going home, and I think we have to go in there worried about Game 3. We can't worry about Game 4. We have to worry about Game 3. We know we have to be better defensively. Our energy has to be better, and then get that win when we play Wednesday."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, we love all of our fans, especially Argentina. You got some great basketball players coming out of there. I love the country as a whole. I love football. That's probably my favorite sport."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"But like I said, we take our fans if we can get them over here in Miami, and we have a lot of love for everybody that supports us around the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think he got off a decently good look. Kind of like a high pick-and-roll isolation, and I just contested it. Pretty glad that he missed it to give us a 1-1 series tie going back to Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I just think nobody cares on our team. We're not worried about what anybody thinks. We're so focused in on what we do well and who we are as a group that at the end of the day, that's what we fall back on. Make-or-miss shots, we're going to be who we are because we're not worried about anybody else. That's how it's been all year long, and that's not going to change."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"So that's what I think it is. I think it's the ""I don't give a damn"" factor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"Some ball pressure. Getting back. Getting our hands on loose balls and just challenging every pass, every shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I mean, he's a hell of a player. He passes the ball so incredibly well. Obviously he can score the ball like he did tonight. But when you get the opportunity to turn the ball over and get out into the open floor, I feel as though we have to do that, and we did a decent job of that today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's just part of the game. A lot of the teams in this league, and that's definitely them, they have some big time shot makers. Like I said, we are going to stay with it. We know what we're capable of, get some stops, we can make some shots as well, and got the opportunity to turn the game around and get one on the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think there's a secret sauce to it. I think we just move the ball, pass the ball to the open guy and play some simple basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"A lot like they do, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"And we made shots. That's what this league is, that's what this game is, make-or-miss game, make-or-miss league. We made some shots they didn't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I see it every day. We talk about it so I know how comfortable he is. I know the level of confidence that we have in him and that he has in himself to go out there and run the offense at any point in time, first through fourth quarter, maybe even overtime."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"And we live with the decisions and the shots that he makes and takes, and he's our starting PG for a reason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. Keep playing basketball as far as I can. Making plays for others. Score whenever I get the opportunity to do so. And through all else, just find a way to win. I think we did that tonight as a group, and we'll continue to do that as a group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,We just didnt play hard enough from the jump. They played really well. Thats how they win games they punch people in the mouth early and out-tough you. They did that and we got to bounce back.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, yeah. Theres going to be tough games, and like I said, they just outplayed us. They came out and hit shots when they needed to hit shots and had a really good start. We got to bounce back next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You dont lose an NBA Finals game because of effort, and thats what we did. We know what we got to fix, and it might be the punch in the mouth we need."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,Just got to bounce back.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,Its a series for a reason. You dont lose on one game. You have to come back the next game and perform better. We messed up some switches and we messed up a lot of things that are controllable. We know that thats not who we are and well get it back next game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,THE MODERATOR,"I'd first like to introduce David Fogel, National Basketball Coaches Association Executive Director and General Counsel. Also joining us is Rick Carlisle, Indiana Pacers head coach and National Basketball Coaches Association president. I'll turn it over to David."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"Thank you, Mark. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are excited to be in Denver for Game 2 of the NBA Finals, and to present the 2023 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"We are especially proud of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who over the years set the standard for integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion of NBA basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"Chuck was an incredible mentor to so many coaches and players in our league, including Coach Carlisle and Coach Adelman. With that, I'd like to turn it over to NBA Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and Coach Adelman. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Coach Carlisle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"Thanks, David. Adam, thank you. I see Byron Spruell in the back. Hi, Mark. Appreciate you guys. Also want to mention that Rick's daughter Kathy Adelman is here, and a lot of things are kind of coming together tonight. Rick's son David is one of the coaches for the Nuggets. Kathy, who is from Portland, went to the University of Portland concurrent with Erik Spoelstra, and they were both point guards on the men's and women's teams. They know each other well. So there's a lot going on here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"Before I announce our committee members that vote on this award -- one of them is Joe Dumars, who is here, appreciate you being here, Joe -- I want to also announce another award that we normally wait until Summer League but thought it was appropriate tonight, given the fact that his son is also coaching. So the Tex Winter Lifetime Impact Award for assistant coaches was voted on about 10 days ago and was awarded to Brendan Malone. Let's give him a hand. Applause."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"This is a night that is a very special night. We're going to announce two awards, which we rarely do. Our committee, I mentioned that Joe Dumars is on it. Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley, who is in the building, Bernie Bickerstaff, Billy Cunningham, Donnie Walsh, Phil Jackson and Lenny Wilkins. Our past winners Tom Heinsohn, Jack Ramsay, Tex Winter, Pat Riley, Bill Fitch, Bernie Bickerstaff, Dick Motta, K.C. Jones, Jerry Sloan, Al Attles, Hubie Brown, Doug Moe, Frank Layden, Del Harris, Larry Brown, last year of course was Mike Fratello."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"Rick Adelman is a guy that guys in my generation watched very closely. When I became a first-time assistant coach in this league, I was out scouting a lot. Back in that era, there was a lot of play calling. You were constantly getting calls and writing things down and drawing diagrams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I learned this from Joe Biden. He talked with cards out here, so I brought mine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I was listening to Rick talk about the teams I had. I have this speech here, but I'm not going to really do it. It was amazing groups that I had. Anybody who coached in the NBA knows that you have a great chance of success when you have really good players. I mean, it's a players' league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But I also learned that you have to have good players and good people, people that will listen to you and will do what you want. I'm just honored to have this award. I think back to a good friend of mine who is not here, Michael Goldberg, who was a very good friend of mine, and really miss him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"It is amazing that it's here in Denver. When the thing was going, I thought, well, we're going to have to fly to Boston. Then all of a sudden Miami wins. So now you've got my son David here as a first assistant. Ish Smith is on the team, who I coached. Daniel Shimensky is a trainer here, and my trainer was Mike Shimensky. Then Erik Spoelstra, of course, hung out at our house all the time and played basketball on our sport court and did all that stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"And then Kyle Lowry, Kevin Love. Robert Pimental is an equipment guy. Forgot about Robert, but it's just like, holy criminy, something happened right. And with Brendan Malone getting that award, I told David, you've got to win it. If you can't win it now with us two getting this award, I don't know how you're going to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I think of Chuck, and it brings back bad memories seeing Joe here laughter, because it was 1990 when we played Detroit in the Finals, my first year coaching. My third year, we got to play Chicago."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"After that, I thought, this is easy. You get to the Finals every two or three years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But we played Detroit, and one thing I admired about Chuck after that series was over is he played to his strengths of his players. I mean, we had to face those three guards they had, Joe, Isiah and then Vinnie Johnson, and they just killed us. They just killed us. I never thought anybody would beat that Portland team three games in a row in Portland, and they did it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"That's where I remember Chuck, how he used the strengths of his team, of his players, to get the best out of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I tried to do that. I think Rick said it best. When I had Portland, who had three of the best offensive rebounders in the league on that team, and they would throw it up there and just go get it back. There wasn't much we could do but just rebound the ball. Great team, great guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Then in Sacramento we had a totally different team. It was a team that passed the ball, cut, shot it well. But again, I got real smart because I put Vlade and Chris Webber at the elbows and let them be our point guard, and that worked. It really worked with that team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Then, of course, when you go coach Yao, you don't screw around with Yao. You put him at the low post. You put him where he can be successful. What a great guy he was to coach. One of the worst things I had to me coaching in this league was when Yao got hurt. It just broke me up because he was such a great player. We had Yao get hurt, Tracy McGrady get hurt and that had just ruined that team. It was a great team, because as you said, 22 wins in a row. I forgot about that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"It's good I get back to these awards because it brings back memories of things. That's what happened with the Hall of Fame, too. It brought back so many memories. At the Hall of Fame, I had eight players come back. I had seven coaches, assistant coaches, come back. That really means something to you when you see all those people again. Here I am with Kevin and Kyle on the other team and a couple other players are here. It really means a lot to me when I think back on it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,It validates what you did.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I know I'm not supposed to do this, but when you're a head coach, and Rick will tell you this, you have people around you who help you. They're part of the reason you get there. I had an owner in Paul Allen who gave me my first job. Out of nowhere, he gave me a chance. I really appreciated that. We got to the Finals my first year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I had assistant coaches that were just great. I'm going to name them, whether people like it or not. John Wetzel was with me for 14 years, I think. Elston Turner, T.R. Dunn, Pete Carril, Bubba Burrage, Terry Porter, Jack Sikma. Pretty good names on this list. Then my two sons, David and R.J., were assistant coaches with me, and Bill Bayno. Great group of guys. That's how you win. You have people around you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"The training staff -- it's just something you think about when you get an award like this. In fact, I see in the back, I think I see -- is LJ back there and Lennan? I got two grandkids here, LJ Adelman and Lennan Adelman, and their mother, David's wife Jenny."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,It's good to see them here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Anyway, I also think the thing you have to do when you're in this league, and anybody who coaches in this league and has been married, you know that your family is so important. Your family is everything to you. They're the ones who stand by you. They're there when you get home. It's long seasons."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,I had a great family. I have 12 grandkids now. Good thing about them is you can spoil them and send them back home.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But the thing I had, too, is I had a rock in our family, my wife Mary Kay, who couldn't be here today, but she was a big reason why you get an award like this. ""Lifetime achievement"" means you have someone special with you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"That's about all I have to say. I'll throw away these cards, and we'll go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"You know, it means a lot. Seeing people that you really care about succeed. I brought my son David in as a developmental coach. I wasn't sure that was really a smart thing for me to do, to get him involved. But he's worked his way all the way up to first assistant, and he's done it on his own. So it's really a pleasure to see that for me. For a father and a coach, it means a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Watching Erik, the way he's grown. Pat took a great chance to give him the job, and he's proven himself, too. You see the ex-players that you've had, that means a lot. When you see guys like Kyle and Kevin, you just think back to all the good times you've had."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I think that's probably the biggest part these awards do, is they give you a chance to see everything. Hall of Fame, my whole family got to go there. I owe all those people. So that's special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,That's a very loose statement.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I learned a lot because I was fortunate, I had my first coach was Jack McMahon, who's no longer with us. He gave me a chance. Pat says I made the team in Portland when he was there because they liked me better, and I said, well, that's probably true."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But I think you learn from -- I had Jack McMahon, I had Dick Motta, Phil Johnson was one of my coaches. I had a lot of coaches who were -- Butch van Breda Kolff was one of my coaches. I was around a lot, and I learned from them. I learned what to do. I started the first couple years. I came off the bench after that, and I just learned what you had to do to be an important part of the team, whether you played or whether you didn't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,I learned that -- then I had six years of junior college at Chemeketa Community College in Salem. It's a hard word to pronounce. It took me a while. But we had great success there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Little did I know that Jack Ramsay was actually following my team at Chemeketa, and when Jimmy Lynam left he called me and asked me if I wanted to interview. I did, and he gave me my first break as assistant coach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,Jack was a unique individual and a great coach.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Well, I watched him coach in high school. He had great success in high school, and his teams were fun to watch play. He had a really good feel of how to coach guys. I watched him work guys out in high school, and the reason I hesitated is because I didn't know how long I was going to be in Minnesota. I really didn't know. I didn't want to pull him all the way from Portland to Minnesota and not have a chance to stay there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But to his credit, after I left, he stayed with Flip Saunders and he stayed with Sam Mitchell and he worked his way into it and worked his way up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,But you never know. It's not like the coaching ranks are really solid right now. Few guys have gotten fired who have been pretty good. You just never know. You've got to get lucky.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I was very lucky. I was 13 years in Portland as an assistant and head coach and I was eight years in Sacramento, four years in Houston. It doesn't happen very often that you get to stay in one place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,That's why I was hesitant. But I just thought he had all the knack and the wherewithal to do the job.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Well, I think what you have to do is when you're a coach, you have to probably put guys in position where they can succeed, and I tried to do that with both of those guys. Kyle, he was a tough little sucker, I'll tell you what, but we got him. I had Aaron Brooks at the time, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But Kyle just kept growing and growing. One thing I remember about Kyle, we played them in exhibition when -- I forgot who he was with. Memphis, that's right. He got a triple-double against us in preseason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"So when they brought in -- maybe we should go after him. I said, go for it, that's great. But he worked his tail off, and he was very -- to me, he was very receptive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Kevin, it was just a no-brainer. I mean, he was a great rebounder, a great three-point shooter. He could post up. I took advantage of his three-point shot because he could do that and he could spread the floor. We had another guy Nikola Pekovic who was our center, who was strong and physical, and Kevin was a perfect fit for him, and Kevin could pass."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,I had watched Kevin in high school. He played with my other son in high school. So I saw what kind of talent he was.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"One thing I learned, too, that I didn't coach then, but I watched a high school team, and their coach wanted me to come in and put our corner offense in. So I did it, but after practice I said, this is not a -- this is stupid. You've got Kevin Love, you need to post him up. You don't want him at the elbow area."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But when I got to Minnesota, it seemed smart to post him up and put him there, and he did it all. He had all the talent in the world. Both those guys, you put them in a situation, see if they succeed, and then you go for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,Usually guys don't disappoint you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I see it. I see it, especially because I watched every Denver game, and Jokic is Jokic. He is so good. You watched him play, and it's fun to watch that type of game be played."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I have a brother who coaches in junior college, and he tried to tell me one night that I can't watch the NBA because it's just one-on-one and three-point shooting, and I said, well, that's because you had no talent when you were in junior -- if you had Jamal Murray, I think you might give him the ball. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"You see it evolving, but I think the three-point shooting has changed the game completely, but when you have -- if you have good post-up people, you're going to go to them. Now the difference is someone like Jokic, you want to double him? Go ahead, because you're going to leave somebody wide open, and he's going to find him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I see it evolving, and I think it's great for the game. I love watching Denver play, and I love some of the things other people, too. Miami does a lot of the same stuff, move the ball. It's a fun way to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Yeah, you know, it's funny because I tell the story all the time that when we started the first training camp and we were playing, and Chris Webber would go to the left elbow all the time, whether or not -- I don't care what we were running, he would run to the left elbow. Vlade would go to the right elbow. I told the coaches, maybe we should just put them there and use them at those spots. They both were good post-up players, but we thought, let's just use them, and they loved it. They loved it. Chris just loved going to the elbow, not all the way down, unless the play was for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"And Vlade, he was just a natural. We kind of just used those guys, and then we had Doug Christie, Peja Stojakovic who was just a great, great shooter, and Mike Bibby who could just flat out shoot it. But they all were willing to cut, they all were willing to do something to set it up for somebody else, and that's what I love about Denver's game. They make the right cut, they set it up for somebody else to get the shot. People don't always see that, but that's why that seem was so much fun to coach, because they were willing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I've told the story before that people say we didn't defend in Sacramento, and during the regular season we didn't defend a lot because we outscored everybody, but in the Playoffs, that team was so intelligent that we put a game plan in and the other team had a hard time scoring on us because they were all together as a unit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"That team was really special, and it was -- Portland and that team were two that I was very fortunate coaching both of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Biggest thing for us, we heard the noise throughout the whole playoffs. Biggest thing for us, we had the will and we had the belief, and we keep finding ways to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"K-Love is impactful even when he's not in the game. You come to the bench, he's always talking to you, telling you what he sees. K-Love has been here, what, five times? Four times? So he has seen everything but the win at this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"The biggest thing for us is, I'm glad he's on our team. He gives us that extra energy, that extra spark, whatever we need. He's all hands on deck."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"I mean, this is the Finals. This is what we live for. This is the opportunity that we have. This is the opportunity that we don't want to let slip away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"So biggest thing for me, man, I go out there, I play with a will, I play with passion and I try to leave it all on the court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Undrafted players can start in the Finals, be productive and it doesn't mean anything that he's undrafted."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"He's giving guys who are going through his path or down that road of, you're not this, you're not that, you're not this, and he's carving a space for himself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,I feel like a lot of people are going to know who Gabe Vincent is.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, when he torched us in the Olympics, in the exhibition game facing Nigeria. He came out with that type of energy, that type of voracity and that type of anger. I felt like, from there, he's one of us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Just trying to take away the cuts. I feel like that's a big part of the offense, the cut, because he's a great passer, their cuts. He sees open guys and just making them all try to take difficult shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"We just made winning plays. We know they are going to try to stop Duncan from shooting threes. You know they are going to guard him. Then you have Jimmy slipping to the rim. I feel like I'm one of the great passers in this league, so just making plays down the stretch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,I wouldn't even say it's playing coach. I think it's just UD being UD. He's in that role now where he's a vet. He's sharing wisdom. He's been in this league 20 years. He's won championships. He knows what it's like to be in these moments.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"To have a guy like that on your bench, it's more important than people think he is. He doesn't change. You know he's going to be honest with you. He's going to say it like it is, so I can't even repeat what he said in the huddle because it will just be a couple words."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,But he's so involved and so invested in us. He wants us to succeed. He wants us to have this great opportunity. He wants us to be successful.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Black lives matter, people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"I think he loves these moments, as well. He loves the competition. I think this is similar to other guys on our team. I think this is when we get the best version of Spo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think personally, I think it's a balance. I think you have to be able to step away in whatever way you relax, to relax, but also you still have job to do. Similar to if you're in school and you're studying for a big test. You can't just sit there in the book all day. You're not going to retain as much information. You got to kind of step away and come back to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"There's definitely film being watched, workouts done, treatment done, whatever the case may be, but also time that's down away from the game or with family or watching a movie or whatever way people may relax."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think we just had an aggression about us and we were just a little bit more deliberate in the way we attacked. It was more of a feel-out game for us, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"They did a number of things very well, and something that we can go back to the drawing board and make some adjustments about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"I mean, it's the Finals. It's never as simple as it seems. It's a complex game. They're a good team. It's going to be tough to beat them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"But we did see some things that we liked and we got some great looks, myself included. We've got to knock those down, and we've got great shooters on our team, and we will knock those down."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,Absolutely. It always is.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"Right away. Can't dwell on it. Luckily it was only Game 1, so we've got more to play. But I'm ready. I wanted to play right after the game was over. I'm not going to let that keep me down. I'm ready for the next game. Going to bring the same energy and effort and hopefully make some shots while I'm at it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"I don't know how to answer that. I think we had great looks the whole game. I liked our offense. We could be a little more intentional with the way we're attacking and just getting guys in their spots, but we'll do a better job of that next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,No. No. I had great open looks. I've just got to knock them down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, Bam is an All-Star. He had a great game. Now it's up to us to help him out. He did a great job finding his own shot and getting other guys involved, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,We're going to keep using him and getting him open into his spots and he's going to keep being great for us.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"No. I mean, Jokic is one of a kind. He's a hell of a player. They're good together. They play well with each other. They read each other really well and they're a tough tandem that we've got to try to keep a hold on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, it all evens itself out. Everything opens up, shooting and driving, when you're doing things at a high level. We'll just find ways to get downhill and attack and everything will open up the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,We knock down some shots that will just make guys' lives a little easier.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,Just stay confident. One game at a time. Just go and get 'em in Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,The status has not changed yet. I'm not trying to be elusive about that. I don't know where that report came out that he was playing Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"All we are focused on right now is his process, continuing to do work and get prepared. Whenever that timeline is, where he's ready to go, I'll let you know."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Semantics. Semantics.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We're doing this game-by-game. I'll let you know tomorrow. The status hasn't changed. You can read into that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's different than Milwaukee. Milwaukee is a little bit more two-on-two. Staying home with the shooter is probably a little bit more like New York, or maybe Chicago."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But what they do, they do very well. You have to make reads. You can't predetermine. You cannot be a robot. We want everybody being aggressive, everybody being a live option."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Obviously, we want to get J.B. and Bam involved as much as possible. They are our two best players. We have to do it in different ways so it's not just a steady diet of whatever that may be. And there were certain aspects of what we did the other night were very good, and there are other areas offensively where we definitely need to improve and be more intentional."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, where do you start? You have two guys that can score 50 in a playoff game. One guy is a triple-double machine that loves to get guys involved. You go down the list of myriad of things you can do defensively, you have to check off some things that you don't really want to do because of both their ability to score and Jokic's ability to create something off-script."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But look, this is what the Finals is about. I said it before Game 1. You're not playing ducks. You're not playing easy competition. You have to find a way to overcome it, even if great players are playing great. We have proven that, and we can win and overcome regardless of how the game is going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Ideal situation would be if it's on our terms and we are controlling the tenor of the game, but we have also won games where we haven't been able to do that for the entire game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, but the intentionality of how we want to attack and appropriate spacing and areas where we can be more aggressive, and whether that leads to free throws or not, you can't control that. But certainly the attacks, and we didn't have enough of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I thought the free throw disparity was appropriate. Maybe we could have got two, four, six more based on a call here or a call there. But overall our attack numbers were lower, and that usually translates into lower free throw attempts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"At the end of the day, it still ended up in a loss. So, yes, we felt like there were some things that we could do better defensively, but the game could be totally different in Game 2. We have to be open to the competition and do whatever is necessary."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In terms of the shooters, that's pretty simple. Let it fly. Ignite. Once they see two go down, it could be three, it could turn into six just like that snap fingers. As long as we are getting those clean looks, that's what matters. And obviously we want to have a little more balance with our attacks and paint opportunities, against a team that does a good job taking it away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I continu to make so many mistakes. It wasn't Shane it was Mike. But that was from a century ago. I barely remember those times.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Shooters need clarity and a great deal of confidence. And they get that from -- who cares if they get it from the head coach. Yeah, the coach is telling them to shoot it. I'd rather get the volume up and we'll play the percentages."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Not necessarily. There's respect. It's moments in between, like, hey, how do you tie this line so I can fish? Those are kind of the conversations laughter. Certainly wasn't X's and O's or schematics."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Probably more than anything, it was just an incredible life experience, something that hopefully will never happen ever again in our lifetime. When we entered into that bubble, we were just as out of our element as you could probably imagine from the outside. You just did not know how long you would be there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"There was an incredible emotional and mental challenge every single day. I think probably our two groups had real consistent spirit about, all right, this is different. Let's make the most of it, and we have a job to do here. But it was just an extraordinary time and experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, yeah. Keep it consistent, just what it's been throughout really the entirety of the season, but definitely the entirety of the playoff run. Try not to overreact to a good game or a bad game. Just kind of stay level headed with it all."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Thankful to have a staff and obviously a head coach in our corner, that's for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think in that sense there are some encouraging aspects of it. Obviously they're a really dynamic offensive team, so you're not going to be able to take away everything, but just make it difficult for them throughout the course of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"You know, I think part of it is when you're in it, you don't necessarily feel that you played as well as maybe you feel like you could have. I think that's part of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"They're obviously a really, really good offensive team. Just trying to learn from that, ways to kind of slow them down in offensive execution. Just seeing that there's opportunities for us to play to our strengths more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,We'll just try to do that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Just play them physical, setting the tone. Obviously they tried to really set the tone there early just around the paint. We're a pretty good team at protecting the paint in general."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,We'll learn from that and try to just have more of a kind of physical tone set early on.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"No, I think honestly it's very much kind of keep it the same, what it's been throughout the year. We've had stretches throughout this year where we've shot the ball great and where we haven't. Keep everything the same, routine the same, maintain consistency, and continue to have that belief and trust to let it fly and that it'll go in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, we got some good looks. Shot quality was there, and I think we can definitely execute better, and I think we will as the series goes on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"This is going to be obviously a challenging task. They're a good defense, good offense, pose a lot of challenges. But we're going to get better as the series goes on. We really believe that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"You know, credit to them for sure. They play differently than kind of defensively we've seen, particularly in the Eastern Conference, some of the things that they do is just a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But it's just an adjustment and getting film with how they're going to rotate and defend and X out on actions and do all that sort of stuff. We'll continue to get familiar with it and work through it, and that's what days today are like."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"You know, we can always attack more. We're an attacking team. That's kind of who we are. Get back to that identity for sure, but we thought we got a lot of good looks, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"In terms of overall strategy, that's more of a coach's question. For us players it's more about executing what the game plan is going in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think in the playoffs, obviously, it's about adjustments game to game, so we had some defensive adjustments. They got loose a few times. Then offensively just figuring out ways to beat them. They played a pretty good defensive game on us, so figuring out ways we could beat them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I thought I had great looks. Ball felt pretty good coming out of my hands, but yeah, I can't worry too much about percentages. They were good looks. I've got to keep shooting those, work on my shots on these couple days off. Hopefully some more fall next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, definitely. I just think an unrelenting will no matter what happens to you until your body can't go anymore, that was just kind of my thought process was like I'm going to keep working at this. This is what I love to do. My whole life growing up I never had a plan B. Always thought I was going to make it to the NBA. Always wanted to be an NBA player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Through all the surgeries, all the up and downs, that never changed. I think it takes a lot of faith, but it also takes a lot of willpower and things like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think there's really a ton of teams throughout the regular season who are good enough to make a Finals run. Tons of things can happen in the playoffs, whether it's injuries, things like that, that kind of give a team an edge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So, I think we knew we had this potential in us ever since this core came together, since we traded for Aaron, and we went on a good little win streak. We really felt like we had this potential back in the bubble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We felt like that Lakers series could have gone a completely different way. Anthony Davis hit a big game-winner, one of those games that put them up in the series, and they were a really good team so they got us there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But we knew we had the team because we were still very young. We knew if we keep this core together, a couple years down the road we could be right back here, and that's what we did."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"And shout-out to the guys that believed in this core, kept us together, and yeah, we're back here and we're excited."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, so in high school I actually played with a few really, really good passers. They're different than Nikola because they didn't come from the center position, but I played AAU with Trae Young who's also a tremendous passer. We fed off of each other. He would find me for amazing looks, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So, I'm used to playing alongside really, really good players. Nikola is a little different, like I said, because a lot of it's coming out of the post and things like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But it's very easy to play with guys like that. I'm very blessed to have good teammates like Nikola.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,Aaron is also a very good passer.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I feel like Jamal has gotten a lot better in that area.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So, we got a lot of dudes who make a lot of good plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, we had a few good looks. I missed one in the corner."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,Nikola missed a little post turnaround shot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I think Jamal missed a shot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But there definitely was a period in that game where we were just launching deep threes, contested shots. I don't think we've really seen a zone the way they do it, so it's hard to make adjustments in the middle of a game when you don't really know what's going on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But that's what the playoffs is about. We watch film, saw what they're doing with their zone. Hopefully attack a little bit better and make a few more of those shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think one thing about our team is we just take what the defense gives us. So, game to game, possession to possession, we've got a lot of guys who are very unselfish and will just take what the defense gives them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think, yeah, I'm still healing, still getting back to my full athleticism and things like that as time goes on, but at this point in the season there's a lot of soreness. When it comes to regular soreness, we all are experiencing that. These games are so intense, playing higher minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But overall, my healing from my surgeries and things like that, I still think I'm on the up and up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think this offseason will make another leap in that area, get to focus on some things you don't get to focus on during the season. But yeah, definitely sore at this point in the year for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, the bubble was pretty unique. So there was three hotels that teams were divided in. I can't remember if the Heat were in our hotel but walking around and going to different restaurants in the bubble, you see everybody. You see all the teams, all the different players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I don't really remember specific instances running into the Heat, but it might have been because they were in a different hotel. But the bubble was definitely a unique experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I look back on it and take a lot of enjoyment. That was kind of the first time playing with the Nuggets where I got consistent minutes, so it was kind of -- it was a good time for me because that still was considered my rookie season and I wasn't getting a ton of time before the bubble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But then we took that big break, I came to the bubble when some guys had COVID so they couldn't come out there, and I really got to play my game and shine with the Nuggets. That kind of started my role on the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But my favorite memory of the bubble is definitely the pina coladas at the pool. We would go to the pool every single day, me, Bol Bol, Torrey Craig. We would just go to the pool and drink pina coladas all day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I mean, we got five guys on the court. I thought Aaron set the tone when they switched. I think I took, like, 15 shots in the first two quarters, so there's really no need for him to be aggressive. We're dominating the game. And when they went zone, he found the pocket, found the middle of the floor and made some key shots in the paint."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,It was a great team game. We had a lot of guys. Mike played really well. KCP was solid on defense the whole game. We had a lot of guys step up throughout the game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just to stay with it. You know, life is going to happen. Stuff is going to happen. Just got to keep the mental fortitude to bounce back in whatever it is, and stay strong. This, too, shall pass. It goes for everything, negative and positive. So just keeping a level head and knowing that you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel one day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just understanding what they are trying to do. They shoot a lot of threes, so they don't have anybody that is going to the rim like that. They missed a lot of really good looks, as well. I think so did we."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"But yeah, you've just got to show your hand, stay disciplined. I think we did a good job of setting our defense. We had guys on a string, and our low man was there repeatedly. And like I said, just trying to defend -- knowing they are trying to get to the free throw line, so trying to defend without fouling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,It's not just the Finals. Way before that. It's meditating before games or at halftime. Taking time for myself to reflect with the good or the bad and come out with the right energy before the game or during the game if I need to adjust.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it's not just basketball. It helps me out with myself, reflecting on myself and being able to have a conversation with myself only so that I can improve within myself. I think that's important for everybody. But basketball-wise, it just helps me refresh and get back to base and a free mind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, we missed some really good looks. I know Miami missed a lot of shots, but we missed some point-blank shots, as well. When they went zone, Jok missed an open 15-footer. I missed an open 10-footer. Mike missed a wide-open corner three. I missed a catch-and-shoot on the wing, which was wide open. I think there's a couple more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"But we got the looks we needed. We just didn't knock them down. If we knock them down, I think they will start to break up the zone a little bit and go back to man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"But it doesn't matter. I think we played a good game. They were trying to fight back all game. I thought we did a good job of just maintaining the lead and not playing conservative by using the clock and not turning the ball over, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"I mean, I don't -- like I said, first round, Finals, it's nothing until you win it, right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"So we haven't won it yet. So until we win it, I think we'll look at it a little differently by then."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's a really good defender. He's got great hands and a great IQ on defense and knows what the player is trying to get to, tendencies, cat-and-mouse, rule of vert, just everything. He talks early in pick-and-rolls. Post defense. There's everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think he does a great job on defense. Everybody is going to have something that they don't do well on the court, and for that to be the one thing that he doesn't do particularly well and be able to still do it at a high level is pretty impressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's been doing it all season. He's been getting better at it, too. So I only see room for improvement for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Any series. You just try to win every game. It's first to four, no matter how you get it done. Obviously, you want to take advantage of being at home. Love playing at home. But any game you can win, you take. So yeah, we're looking forward to just winning every single game that we play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think he won Strength Coach of the Year a season ago. So he's well regarded, not only by people in this building but throughout the NBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Ever since he took over as the head strength coach for our team, he's been phenomenal in terms of not just Nikola, but all of our players, getting them in shape, getting them stronger."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's constantly aware from the nutritional standpoint just all the way across the board. Felipe has been a huge asset not just to myself, but the entire group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think throughout these 16 playoff games so far our bench has been great. Regular season, some of those non-Nikola minutes were somewhat of a crapshoot. You didn't know what you were going to get."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think a big reason for us playing at the level that we've played at was that when Nikola has gone out, the other guys have stepped up and played well. Right now, we have a three-man bench group, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, Christian Braun. I think those guys are playing well. If Nikola is out, Jamal and Michael or both of them are on the floor so we have two of our top three scorers on the court at all times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But the key for that group is to defend. If you can get stops, you can get out and run. That's when that group is at its best, because you don't have the luxury of coming down and playing through Nikola in the post or wherever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So defend, rebound, run, and then other guys just playing their game and playing the games to the best of their ability."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, he can't play 48. I mean, I've got to get Nikola out. So he's been running the first and third quarter, and he sits to start the second and fourth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think overall, I think Nikola's defense has been a real positive. I think you have to get past the eye test with Nikola because I think most people just think of great defensive players as a guy who is blocking a shot or just making a great athletic play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Nikola does it differently. He has a tremendous IHe's got great anticipation. He's got unbelievable hands for deflections, blocks. He's got unbelievable feet for deflections."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, Miami, they're going to run a lot of pick-and-rolls. I think they lead the Playoffs in double drags set per game, as well as just over 50 direct screen-and-rolls per game, with Jimmy handling the majority of those."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So through 16 games now people put Nikola in just a crazy amount of pick-and-rolls, and we, I think, do a pretty good job of mixing up our coverages, mixing up our levels. Sometimes he's up, sometimes he's down, sometimes we switch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"We got into in the Lakers series Nikola switching on to LeBron at times. When you first hear that, it doesn't -- there is no way you are going to switch Nikola on to LeBron. But he actually did a pretty good job at times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I think his defense is underrated and I think his maturation in the eight years, I think that's been a big part of it, as well. Him understanding that I have to be the best defensive player I can be to help this team become the best team that they can be. He doesn't shy away from that responsibility."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I don't think we played well in Game 1. I watched that tape, and they were 5 of 16 on wide-open threes. As I told our players this morning, the fact that they got 16 wide-open threes is problematic, and if you think that Max Strus is going to go 0 for 9 again or Duncan Robinson is going to go 1 for 5 again, you're wrong."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"The fourth quarter, we gave up 30 points, 60 percent from the field, 50 from three, 6 of 12 from the three-point line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I told our players today, don't read the paper, don't listen to the folks on the radio and TV saying that this series is over and that we've done something, because we haven't done a damn thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"We won Game 1. The reason I told our players I was excited this morning is because we won Game 1 and we didn't play well, and there's so many things we can do better. If we do those things at a better level, we'll have a chance to win Game 2 tomorrow night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,I thought our pick-and-roll defense was poor. I thought our shrink the floor was poor. I felt they got 11 offensive rebounds. Bam had four Jimmy had three.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's just playing to your strengths and feeling how the game goes. You never know how a team is going to guard you. Early in that game, they were switching some things that allowed Aaron to sit down in that paint and post up a smaller player. I think he had 14 of his 16 points in that first half and got us off to a great start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's something that organizationally, that's something, conversations with Calvin Booth when I took over last summer, that was their priority. When you looked at last year's NBA Finals, not many small players out there because people are going to find you. We wanted to have positional size, strength, versatility. I think Calvin has done a hell of a job kind of putting this group together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I thought we got some pretty good looks. The reason their zone was effective in that fourth quarter was because we didn't get any stops. They shot 60 percent, which allowed them to set up in their zone every possession, it seemed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But you look at the first two shots we got against their zone, Nikola was in the middle of the paint -- great look. Jamal gets one middle of the paint -- great look. We miss those. Michael Porter gets a corner three -- great look. Doesn't go in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I talked about them being 5 of 16 on wide-open threes. I think maybe we were 1 for 6 on wide-open threes. But with how heavy they are in terms of guarding the paint, we also have to generate more threes and more quality threes, and I think those will be there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think those two especially have just a tremendous amount of experience in doing so. They've played together for seven years now, and we've been in a lot of big games. Obviously never in the Finals before. But Jamal and Nikola to me has been a potent two-man game for many, many years now. They know how to communicate with each other without even speaking, just reading and playing off of each other and making the right reads."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the key to that two-man game is making sure the other three players are spaced correctly so they can operate in space, and no matter how you guard that, there's a counter to it. You're talking about two really skilled, talented and unselfish players who are willing to make the right play every time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, we didn't go in saying we're going to make Bam Adebayo beat us. We came in with full respect for Bam Adebayo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But if you're going to score 26 points on 25 shots, that's something we're willing to live with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But we can do a better job. That's something that we talked about today, giving him different looks, making sure we're contesting, making sure we're shrinking the floor, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But he's a very effective player. He can playmake. He can rebound and push. He scores in the pocket. Offensive rebounds. Whatever it is, Bam can control the game in a lot of different ways. That's the reason he's an All-Star. We just have to make sure that we are working and contesting and making him feel us as best as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,I'm not surprised. Bam played a great game. He got to his spots. He made jump shots. He was aggressive. That's what we need from him.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think what it opened up, Bam was able to get in the paint. He was the one guy that was getting paint touches. It helped us, kind of settled us down a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But yeah, they obviously won the game, so it worked for them, but we've got to continue to find ways to get him the ball and for him to stay aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Exactly what I said, what you just said. Got some really good looks. Keep shooting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"I think Max is a very confident player. He got -- those shots he missed, he won't miss them again. That's the game of basketball. Sometimes -- it's a make-or-miss league. The one thing about Max is he's going to continue to shoot, and the one thing about our team, we're going to continue to tell him to shoot the ball, keep going, keep shooting, keep pushing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"At the end of the day we need him to stay aggressive and make shots and shoot shots. We've got a good locker room, so we believe in what he does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"I think this time of year you've got to stay locked in. You've got to watch film. You've got to stay in the game, stay in tune, stay in tuned to what's going on. For me, I stay in tune."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, you go get dinner, you hang out with your friends and family to kind of get away, but for the most part I focus on the game to see what I can do and see what I can help the team do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But as the Playoffs continue to go and get deeper, you've got to stay focused on the games. You can't let your mind wander too much. Yeah, you've got to take some time away, but you've got to stay focused on the game and watch the film and see what you can do to help the team get better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, a lot. You mean like what? What type of positives? You didn't ask that part."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,I would think we just took some -- we got good shots. We got good looks. We got to our spots. We got the situation that we wanted to be in offensively. Defensively we figured some things out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But in the Playoffs every single game is different, especially in the Finals. Every single game is going to be a different type of game, different brand of basketball, different approach, and different guys are going to play well, so we're seeing some good things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I was with him when he started. Ish to this day is one of my guys that I still call my rook. I appreciate it because he's a guy who persevered, wasn't the greatest shooter, wasn't the greatest this, but he just found a way to find a niche in this league and find a niche on every single team he's been on, and to be a great veteran, a great veteran presence, a great positive vibe for every team he's played for."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Thirteen teams is a lot of teams, but obviously he's done his job, and he's still in the NBA, and he's on a team right now that's in the Finals. He's done something correct, and I'm just proud to have a guy like that say he was under my wing for a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I can't think of -- I'm pretty old in this game right now. I played Tim Duncan and Tony Parker. Honestly, that's a great combination that I got the opportunity to play against. Jamal and Jokic, they're deadly because they both can score, pass the ball. They're big targets, and they have a great feel for each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But yeah, that combination, they're very, very good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"No, I don't think it affected us. I think we were ready to play. I think Coach always says it, he said it, give us our parachutes and drop us in, and we'll be prepared to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"I think Denver played a really good game the first game, and we missed a lot of shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But it's all about preparation now for the next game, so we'll be well prepared to go, and we'll be ready to go tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"He's lying because I've got to go to Spain so I call him when I go to Spain, so yes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yes, I will see him in Marbella in a few weeks. Definitely will go visit him because he's my guy and they have a great facility over there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But yes, I will be in Spain in a couple weeks. Looking forward to seeing my guy, my amigo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course, it's motivation. It's huge because it's never done before. We are going to leave some legacy if we do it. But I don't know, are kids supposed to look up to me or whatever, I think they need to have their own path."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I don't think about that much. I'm just playing. I'm just playing, and my focus has never been those kinds of records or whatever, whatever the media are putting on me. I'm just trying to win a game and just play every game. Go step-by-step and play every game to win a game, as simple as that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, he is always the guy who has optimism and energy is so high. I'm completely opposite of him. Just to have him since I came here and we are growing together, and now we have an opportunity to do something nice, I think it's good for both of us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,Some possessions we play amazing and some possessions we didn't play good. Some quarters we played really good. I think that's basketball. That's why it's a live thing. You cannot predict what's going to happen.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course, we are going to be better, but we are going to take 1-0 for us. Just being focused for 48 minutes, I think that's going to be the key. Just the way how they play, they don't let their guard down and they are always playing the same way with the same pace. I think that's why they are great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think I need to get a trophy, my friend, I don't know what it is. I'm joking, I'm joking laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not just me. I think when you see the last game, us against Miami, in the first three quarters, they score 65, 68 points. I think that's really amazing. And then you can see the fourth quarter, they scored 30-something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's different. It's different when you play for Serbia. It's always a little bit more of emotions, adrenaline. The whole country is cheering for you, and that's the dream for every player that ever played probably from Serbia, to play for the national team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's a little bit more of, I don't say -- let's say pressure, but it's not pressure. Just emotions. It's a little bit of everything, let's say, for one little next level of everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"The shots that he make, it was pretty easy shots for him. I need to do a little bit better job just to make him uncomfortable. I think he can go to the shots that he wants, if that make any sense, but I just need to be there just to -- him to do another step or another dribble or another move. Just don't give him the easy ones, let's say like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I mean, I think in the past somebody is always injured. We never had a constant group of guys coming off the bench, if that makes any sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Now when we kind of know the rotation, I think the guys are doing a really good job of playing and being aggressive and attacking when they see the seams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Oh, I like it. Doing good. It's raining today. It was rainy when I came here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Oh, I like it, my friend. Appreciate it. Appreciate it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we are just waiting for the game to come. I think when the game comes, everything is going to be normal. Right now, everything is a little bit too much."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Thank you, my friend."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not just him. I think he played with a lot of good players. He was on some good teams, and he saw a little bit of everything. But Ish, Jeff and him are kind of all old hats, let's say like that. When they talk, I think everybody listens because if you listen to them, you can hear some really smart things that can help you play the game. I really appreciate and am really thankful for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think from the jump we've just got to set the tone defensively. They're a big, physical team, so we know they're going to try to bully us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"We've got to stand our ground, be physical, and keep pushing the ball with pace and make it as tough as possible on the defensive end and just keep playing our game, move the ball side to side, and make good plays on offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yes, I've waited for this opportunity to play in the NBA Finals. My story has been a whirlwind getting here, so I'm definitely grateful and blessed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,So I'm going to take advantage of my opportunity and do whatever I've got to do to help the team win.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, like I just said, my journey has been a little crazy. I went to a smaller school so I had to work my way up, but I'm glad that I'm here. Put in a lot of work, and I'm going to trust my work and continue to play my game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"For sure. We only shot two free throws that game, so we definitely need to get to the free-throw line more, attack the paint, set the tone, and then spray out from there and be more aggressive for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Just make it as difficult as possible. Like I said, be physical with them. They have a lot of different actions. They have a great passing big man, a lot of different guys who can score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,We've just got to be physical and communicate about different things they're doing and just keep playing hard.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, for me I'm a younger player, so having those guys in my ear has been great for me, just learning different things. They've been in these positions before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"K Love has a ring Udonis has three rings I'm pretty sure. So just learning from those guys can help me, help me in the long run."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, we're not discouraged at all. This is a great basketball team. We're a great basketball team. We're going to have to compete to win this. They won Game 1, that gives us time to respond and make adjustments and go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, like I said, they've been here before. They know what it takes to win a championship. They know what it takes to win these close playoff games. They're going to have a lot of information, a lot of experience for the younger guys that we've got."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,They have confidence as well. So that veteran leadership is going to be big for us for sure.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Just relaxing and chilling, taking your mind off basketball, doing stuff -- our families are here. Hanging out with our families and just watching film and going from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"For me, I've just been relaxing, doing what I normally do outside of basketball, and then when basketball comes I get back to the film and lock back in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I'm not a big hockey person. I actually did go to a Panthers game. It's pretty cool to watch. Now that you've said that, what time do they play? 600 here? I might watch. It's the Game 1, right, Stanley Cup? I'll probably watch that, thank you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I actually live in Miami in the off-season. My wife is from there. And he's somebody who whenever I see him, we break bread and we speak. He's somebody I look up to as far as his longevity, how he grinded through the league. He paved his way he did it his way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"For me, that's somebody who you've got to look up to, you've got to respect. For me, he's somebody who I can always count on when I need some knowledge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I think for us it's about looking at film and figuring out things we can get better at. I think at the end of the day it's about effort, but there's some things we can change that we can get better at that we've spoken about. We've just got to go out there on the floor and just execute those plans."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Oh, man. To keep it short, I think it's mostly just staying positive in that grind. Sometimes when you're battling it uphill, you're trying to figure out a way -- things might not go your way. That's when the negativity can kick in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"But for me, it's about keeping the positivity and everything to do with being prepared to work every day, not being afraid of messing up or being uncomfortable. It's about growth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,I've been through it all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Negative is always going to be there somehow, some way, in some form. It's always going to creep. But I think that positivity has just got to override it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I think he kept the game simple. I think he uses his size to his ability. He was a force down low, and that was great for us to get us off to a good start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"You can't ever predetermine how a game is going to go. I think you just try to read the game, and I think that's something he did very well at the beginning of the game. He got to his spots, got out in transition, got smaller guys on him, and used his size."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"But it's the Finals, man. This is everything. The energy is the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"He's a great guy. His energy that he brings every day, it keeps us going. His passion for his work is amazing. He gives us great energy, and I love Felipe, man, even Claus. They come in and they come to work and they prepare us each day to guard our own floor. They keep our strength right. They're a big part of what we do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I do? I've been there before. Barbosa took me there, I can't tell you, it was a long time ago. We were in Boston. We went for All-Star break. I had a great time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Yes, thank you for all your support. I can't speak the language, but thank you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I really don't care. I just want to play. To be honest, I don't care how long we've got. My job is just to be prepared for the time I'm given on the floor, be there for my teammates."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"So one day, two days, three days, it doesn't matter. On game day, I'll be prepared and I'll be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Yeah, 100 percent. I could have played yesterday. That's the energy that the Finals gives you. This is what you live for. This is what you play for. You sacrifice everything for these moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I'm just excited to be here, and right now we have a 1-0 lead, but we have to continue to protect home court, try to go up 2-0."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"My wife and kids are gone right now. They've gone home to Miami for when we get there, so I'll be able to get some sleep tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Defense. Defense. So, when he's sitting on the floor we need to lock in on defense. That's probably the most important, crucial aspect of the non-Nikola Jokic minutes because that's how our defense -- that's how we get our offense, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"So, when we get stops on defense, we can get out and run, and we're really fast and versatile when it comes down to defending."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"No, no, definitely thrive, not surviving. I feel like surviving is almost like fear based. No, we ain't got no fear."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Well, I think they got a few too many open looks. It's going to happen. But we need to cut down on the number of open looks that they get. Getting back in transition, keeping them off the offensive glass, and then just kind of tightening up on the defensive end, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"I think they stopped switching. They started to -- I'm not entirely sure how they're going to play the pick-and-roll this time between me and Jamal. They went under one time and got back to Jamal, but they were switching 1 through 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"So, I don't expect them to do that again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"But I'm going to just run out in transition, try and get deep seals, continue to be aggressive with whoever is in front of me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"No, we've lost a game. We've lost since April."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Oh, at home? We just take a lot of pride at home. Yeah, we take a lot of pride in protecting our home floor. We have a great fan base that's behind us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,I think that's what it really comes down to is just understanding what it means to keep home-court advantage.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"It's huge, man. It's priceless. JG is so basketball savvy. It's like he's playing chess out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"He keeps everybody poised, solid, professional, and he's still a hell of a talent. To have a guy that can produce and create on the floor is extremely important, and then a guy that can talk to you and give you advice and lead from off the floor is just as crucial."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,It's just solid. It's all sound advice. It makes sense. It's to the point. It's not confusing or left to interpretation. It is exactly what we need to hear every time.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"No, no, it wasn't too much of a switch. I think what was interesting in my first six years in Orlando, I had six different coaches, and before that it was Sean Miller at Arizona and then my high school coach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"So, within eight years, it was eight different coaches and a multitude of coaching staffs and training staffs. There was a lot of movement in there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"In that I got to pick the brain of brilliant coaches for maybe just a year at a time, but still, I got to pick up little pieces from Jacque Vaughn, James Borrego, Frank Vogel, Steve Clifford, Scott Skiles. I hope I'm not missing anybody. Sorry if I am."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Short time we had together, the year that we had together, and then kind of bring it together to an organization like Denver where Coach Malone had already been here for a certain number of years. Coach Malone being here for a number of years and already having a -- kind of like something already going, established here, a foundation. He already had a foundation and had been playing on it for three years, four years, five years. I'm not even entirely sure how long. Five years, maybe six years. Just being able to come in and be myself, that was the biggest thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"They told me from the jump, we got you for a reason. Just be yourself and everything will work out. That's what it came down to. Even in the first game, it was just like a breath of fresh air just because it was like the first time I was able to just like get a back cut and then just like an easy dunk. There was just so much going on on the floor, so much spacing, and it seemed like everybody complemented each other so well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, you just can't be complacent with this team. You can't be lackadaisical. You can't sleep on this team. This team has no quit. They will continue to fight through the entirety of the game. You've got to understand that about this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,You can't take your foot off the gas with these guys.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, throughout the years I got to develop a lot of great relationships in Orlando, whether it be the coaching staff or player development or some of my teammates. Yeah, they still reach out to me and give me some advice from here and there and just let me know that they're still rooting for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"It's difficult because the people around you get excited, as well. So, you have to keep like a calmness. You have to keep a poise to you, like an intense energy but calm, while the rest of everybody else is really frenetic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,It's important to just make the main thing the main thing and just be focused on what the task is at hand.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"One more thing about that -- my bad -- about the media, you know. Still reading the newspaper and the news around the world is important and not being consumed with kind of the bubble that is the NBA, even though it expands during the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"But still, being aware of the other things that are going on outside of the media, the NBA, and the things that are going on outside of the world and reading world news is still really important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah. I try to, as much as possible. Just to keep my teammates engaged on that end because we can sometimes get lost, and then we're scrambled a lot. Just trying to keep them focused on the game plan that we've got defensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It does change a lot, but whatever Coach is drawing up or we're talking about in the huddle, I try to keep telling the guys on the court what we're doing and where to be. Even myself, just to remind myself I'm supposed to be in these positions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Anybody can come out and say it, but it seems like I'm the main person just doing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"They had a lot of wide-open threes. They generated I think 16 open threes, so they had wide-open threes, and they just missed them. But we had almost like 50 something contests on all shots. I want to credit our defense for making them miss, and just got to continue to do it Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Stay motivated. We're here don't fumble the ball on the 1-yard line I would say. We've got three games left, let's stay focused and let's get this championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"That fourth quarter. We came out a little flat. We had great looks at the basket. We just didn't knock them down. But we wanted to get into our offense a little bit earlier than 14 seconds on the clock and just play normal basketball, our basketball, go through our game plans and our plays and just try to get a great shot every time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We could be better. We were happy we got the win, of course, but our pace and how we played throughout the whole game, we can be a lot better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"No difference. I've got that question so many times. They're both high-IQ basketball players. They make their teammates better, and they can score on any level. I don't see no difference."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Oh, man, he still does to this day. Every game it's something different, or in practice he's showing something that's like real magical. But he never ceases to impress me, just playing with him. He's made me a better player, makes his teammates better around him. He just likes to see everybody happy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I don't see him much off the court, but just being active in our group chat, just talking, joking around a lot. He's really a comedian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just been taking care of my body, staying in the gym, being ready for any opportunity that I get, and just basically just staying ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Not much. I just think I've got to do a better job of getting the ball, demanding the ball, being more aggressive. That's just that, and that will change come Game 2. Yes, they do have some really good defenders, but I have seen really good defenders before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I think this whole playoff season has been a chess match for everybody on this team, not just myself. So you know, going into Game 2, whatever it takes to win, if I've got to pump-fake five times or 15 times, you've just got to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. I'm going to continue play the right way. I'm going to pass the ball to my shooters the way I have been playing the entire playoffs, the entire year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"But yeah, I think I've got to be more aggressive putting pressure on the rim. I think that makes everybody's job a lot easier. They definitely follow suit whenever I'm aggressive on both sides of the ball. So I have to be the one to come out and kick that off the right way, which I will, and we'll see where we end up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,Not at all. I think I played basketball the right way.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Well, my daughter is out here, so ripping and running with her. Played a lot of Spades. Spades didn't go too well for me yesterday, now that I think about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I'm going to do an escape room tonight. I think my guys went and saw Spiderman today. Just doing normal stuff, because at the end of the day, I'm as normal as they come. It's not always about basketball. It will never always be about basketball. That's how I regroup. I stay consistent in that because that's what I know I can fall back on. My guys, they are going to love me whether I win or lose. My daughter is going to love me whether I win or lose. So that's what I focus on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, I need to say to them I'm still going to throw you the ball, and if you miss the next ten, if you're open on that 11th one, I'm still going to throw you the ball, because you'll never be the reason why we lose. It's always a group effort. I want you to take the same shots because they are going to be there. We are going to throw you the ball. Stay aggressive because you've been the reason that we have won so many games before. You are going to be the reason that we win games now, and that's never going to change."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I have a lot of faith in those guys. I'm in their corner, Bam is in their corner, Spo, Coach Pat, everybody. So when everybody is in your corner, you only have one job to do Shoot the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Do that again. Maybe hold them to 12 less points. Hopefully we can win the game. That's it. No matter how many points they score, we just need to score more. Get some more stops, play harder. Do things the right way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"We're okay. We really are. We are very calm. We are very collected. We have so much confidence, still. It's not going anywhere. We're going to believe in one another, always, no matter what, home or away. And we're still going to get four."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think too much has to be said, I really don't. Down 0-3 up 3-0, you've got to get to four. It's never over. Nobody is ever counted out. You've got to get to four. Once you get to four, it's over with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"So down 0-1, we know we are going to get to four. We are in there laughing, in there smiling, knowing that we could play better. We will play better. We have to be better if we want to win. Not too much is said. It's all about what we're going to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Tough. Tough. They do everything well. You've got to guard both of them, majority of the time with two people. We've got to figure that out because that's coming at us every possession -- if not every possession, damn sure every other possession."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"We'll key in on it. We'll lock on it. But it's tough, no matter who it is, guarding those two guys, who are willing passers and can give you 50 on any given night. Then they have shooters everywhere on the floor. But you're going to have to do hard things to get to where you want to get to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think he does well for what he's able to do. He moves his feet well. He's constantly making guys make decisions whenever they get into the paint. Then his outlet passes from a defensive rebound are very, very elite that, he's been doing his entire career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"As much as everybody looks at what he does on the offensive side of the ball, he's a hell of a defender, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Pass the ball, which is what I'm going to do. Shoot the ball. Make some shots, which I'm capable of doing, as well. I just don't think we played our best game of basketball, and that's okay. We've just got to be better come tomorrow, which we will be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I'm still playing the game the right way. It's not being passive. It's getting my guys involved, because whenever they make shots, my job is a lot easier."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"The country music started when I was in high school. I didn't like it much in high school when I first started listening to it, but my friends at the time, the people I was close with, that's all they listened to, so I kind of got used to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Then I started remembering the lyrics when I got to Vermont Academy during baseball games, because I was on varsity baseball my senior year, and they'd warm up to Zac Brown Band Homegrown, and that was like the first song."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"And by Lady A, Downtown was like the first two songs I really liked."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I think we got shots that we liked. Mike had an open three Jamal had three and Jokic had 15-foot shots open they just missed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"We worked on it today, so hopefully we can execute tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"No, we felt like we played a lot better, so we tweaked a few things on both ends of the floor. We know Miami is a great team. They are going to come out Game 2 and play extremely hard, so got to be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"I could not hit the ball. I was a bunt -- I laid it down. But I was a great base runner and infielding, but I could not hit the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I loved my time in Vermont, but basketball-wise it was great for me, just living on campus, being able to get in the gym whenever I wanted, and then playing better competition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"And I really started lifting a little bit in high school, so just to focus on basketball a lot more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, he texted after the Heat won and was like, see you in Miami. I'll see you there, but that's about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, AG was huge for us, like he is all year, just chillin in the paint on smaller defenders, scoring whenever he wanted. So want him to continue doing that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"After my freshman year at Wakefield, I knew I was going to have to do that at some point, but my mom didn't want me to leave the house so young."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"So yeah, after freshman year we talked about it and she was like, after your sophomore year you can go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, I think the guys did a really good job of handling that for me. They built a pretty big lead, and when I come in, my job is just to elevate it. There's not much nerves with what I do. I come out and try to guard people, play defense, get our guys the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's not too much nerves with my job, and like I said, those guys do a really good job of building a lead and my job is just to add on to that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Obviously their coach is a great coach so you know that was a really good move for them at the time, and I think that we're a tough team to zone because of our shooters and we have Nikola, so I don't know, I think that we're going to attack it differently, be ready for it now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So I don't know if it'll have the same effect, but they have great players that play really good defense, whether it's man or zone, and they have a really good coach. They're going to make adjustments like that and they're going to throw different things at us, and that's what they're really good at, and that's why they're here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, they're a really good defensive team, so there's going to be nights where it's tough to score, but you win basketball games making it tough on them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think we did a good job of making it tough on them. They missed some open shots, some stuff we have to tighten up, but the best part about that is we won when we played bad."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"We didn't think we played well, and obviously we are going to come back and play a better game. We know they're going to come back and play a better game. If we just do what we're supposed to do, we're going to hit shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They didn't hit shots like they thought they would, but we had great shooters miss a lot of shots, too. We know they're going to be better, but we know we're going to be better. You want to win basketball games when you play bad. That's the most important part."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,Mom doesn't give me constructive criticism at all. Mom is more critical --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"It's not constructive most of the time. Laughter. She'll throw it in there every once in a while, but mom is definitely the critical one of the bunch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Most of the time honestly it's at halftime or something. If she sees something she doesn't like, she'll text me and let me know. Obviously I see it after the game right away. Mom is definitely the critical one, but I know she means it with love."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, Coach Self texted me before the game. I think I saw it after. He just told me good luck. That means a lot coming from him, obviously."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"And then my brother is playing for him, too, so I've gotten to talk to him more recently. But yeah, he texted me before the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think it's a really cool thing, so hopefully everybody has that experience. I think it's really cool. I see Jamal talk to his dad all the time. They talk before games, and that's obviously a really cool moment for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think that being in these moments, obviously the Final Four kind of helped me with that, like I said I've kind of been here before and I think we played a million games this year it feels like. It's just another game at this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"This game means a lot, but you've kind of got to approach it the same way you approach everything else. Same routine. So I think that's why we're so good. We got a lot of guys that are really consistent with the routine. Just because it's the Finals game we don't try to change anything. We try to be us. We come out there and play hard, and I think that's why we win a lot of games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"I don't know. I guess you'll have to ask the Nuggets. But for me, it was just a great opportunity for me. I feel like all those shots were in my wheelhouse, and I've been shooting them all season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"I think it's the nature how Denver is playing it. They don't want him getting downhill and being in open space. I feel like the biggest thing when we're in pick-and-roll is for me to get him open. That's the point of the pick-and-roll, to get my guy open and let him have space."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,Open shots. Open looks. Biggest thing for us is making both of them work in not as much space and really making them take difficult shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,We missed a lot of open shots that we usually make. I feel like that won't happen again. We had a lot of open shots that rimmed in and out usually go in.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"Our process? We got a lot of pocket pass, open threes. Watching film, we had a lot of space to work with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,We definitely know they are going to make adjustments. But the fourth quarter is definitely a big emphasis of ours after watching film and understanding what we did and the opportunity we had.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like we can protect home like no other. Having an opportunity to be 1-1 and then you take care of home, that's a 3-1 split, and you try to close out the series from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It's good. He's ready to go.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It actually has been really important for our group, just to bring that added veteran decorated experience. They've been through the battles. They really infuse a lot of confidence in our young guys. I don't even want to call them young guys anymore."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But also, the example that they set. When I say they're decorated champions, even at this stage in their career, they're willing to take on different roles, and they both have started for us this year, they both have come off the bench, and they've both been really effective in both of those roles. And right now, where we are, this is just what makes the most sense. But they're willing to do whatever, and they just want to help this team get over the top."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'm not sure. No, I don't know. We're going over our prep and that kind of thing. I don't know if that's what you're talking about. I'm glad Pat has never given me a quiz. I probably would have failed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, of course we both feel the same way about that, and it feels at times awkward, us talking about it. It feels like we're lecturing other organizations when we have no business telling them how to do their business. We can only speak from our experiences."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we're definitely going to have to go to school on it. They are in a pretty good rhythm, especially in that first half. Our disposition, the multiple efforts, the resolve in the second half was much better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But you get to this level, it has to be complete games of that kind of disposition. Even if you have that, you are not always going to win all the possessions that you want."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,But that's what you expect. You don't expect it to be easy when you get to this Final round.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This is a great challenge. It's going to require more. We will get to work and see what we can do better, what we can do harder, what we can do with more effort, what we can do with more focus, etc."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, that's what we need from everybody, regardless of when you come into the game, how many minutes you're getting, those inspiring minutes. And that's what our team is about, having a roster of guys that just come out there and you're making great efforts, you're impacting the game and then it inspires the next guy to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We need more of those kind of things. He's kept himself ready, and those are good minutes, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We had some good, clean looks from the three-point line. Then we had too many possessions where we didn't work it to get the possession on our terms."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But you have to credit them with their size and really protecting the paint and bringing a third defender. Things have to be done with a lot more intention and a lot more pace, a lot more detail."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We are an aggressive, attacking team, and so if we are not getting those kind of opportunities at the rim or at the free throw line, we have to find different ways to be able to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, they are fine. I mean, they are not going to get sick at sea. If they are shooters, you're not always going to be able to make all the shots that you want. Then you have to find different ways to impact the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Our game is not built just on the three-point ball. We have proven that time and time again. We can win games. We can win series, regardless of how the three is going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But we also have ignitable guys. You see a couple go through and that also can become an avalanche. One way or the other, we have to find a way to get the job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I thought he had some good opportunities right in his sweet spot and then also some opportunities at the rim. Then I thought some of our detail with the spacing and the pace and our intention of our offense kind of got us jammed up.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It always kind of could look different, a few of these threes go down at the right time, a few of the layups right at the rim or the short ones go down at the right time, that also could change your perspective or tenor of how you think things are going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,But we do need to do things better. I think that part is clear.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's different. That's what you expect going into this series. They're a passing and cutting team, but also they are an aggressive team, and so are we."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I didn't even look at the box score yet, but like I said, I think the disposition, the efforts were more appropriate in the second half. But that's not enough. It has to be for a full game, and you also have to make some plays when you're beat."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The plays in between it's not always going to happen perfectly. It's not always going to happen based on the scheme. That's the nature of our team, is we find a way to compete and overcome whatever it is. We need a lot more of that in Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I don't know. I never point to the scheme. Scheme is not going to save us. It's going to be the toughness and resolve, collective resolve. That's us at our finest, when we rally around each other and commit to doing incredibly tough things. That's what our group loves to do more than anything, to compete, to get out there and do things that people think can't be done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The efforts made that work in the second half, but we're proving that we can do that with our man defense, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we've been through this before. Like, they are ignitable snapping fingers. They have heard it from us. They will hear it from us. I love those looks that those guys get. I love it when they see a couple, two or three go down that can turn into five or six."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But I also love it, you know, that toughness and grit, that we don't have to depend on that. We can find different ways and different solutions to get a win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,Thrilled to be here for these Finals. You've written so much about them already. Having a first seed against an eight seed just adds that much more intrigue to the competition.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think they've both had separate, interesting paths to make it here, to have a Play-In team, obviously in the Miami Heat, be here, and one that, as Coach Spoelstra said, struggled in many ways throughout the season. But he said something along the lines, embrace the grind of the regular season. Had a lot of injuries they had to overcome. I think the Miami Heat lost the third-most games, players to injuries over the course of the season. But here they are."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"It's interesting, something also I've been thinking about are the similarities despite them being the first and the eighth seed. One, again, beginning with ownership, you have the Kroenke family and the Arison family. Both Arisons have been involved with ownership a few years longer than the Kroenkes. But with Stan and Josh, you have a father and son combination, with Josh of course taking on the presidency of the team. Same thing with the Arisons, with Micky and of course Nick is the CEO of the organization and work together as a fantastic team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Both families are very engaged with the league office, serve on several committees and don't miss anything that goes on in the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of star players on both teams, of course you have two essentially late-round draft picks in Jokic, a second-rounder, the 41st pick, and Jimmy at the end of the first round as the 30th pick. I think that's a great story for basketball fans everywhere."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Coach Spoelstra and Malone, you have two of the coaches with the longest longevity in the league. Erik has the second-longest tenure and Michael the fourth-longest tenure. A lot to be said there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Again, and just the markets, two roughly around the same mid-sized markets in the league, I think that's intriguing, too. I think it speaks a lot to the competitiveness in this league and the fact that we've come up with a system now, working closely with the Players Association and all the teams, where I like to think every team in this league has a shot to compete for a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We saw in this season in particular, it was a record with roughly just a little over a week left in the season, you had 26 teams still competing for the Playoffs. As I said, that's a record."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,He's somebody who everyone here -- I know many of you in the media knew him well and was someone I got to spend an enormous amount of time with over my 30-plus years with the league. Just wanted to mark his passing again and his impact on the league.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Lastly, I'll say that I appreciate the amount of international coverage of those who traveled to be here in the Finals. I know it's not an easy trip when the cities, of course, aren't known until relative last minute. But these games will be carried in 214 countries and territories and 60 different languages. And on top of that, we continue to have an enormous, measured in billions of followers globally on social media."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"There's tremendous anticipation for these Finals. And with that, happy to answer any questions anyone has."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, I think there's enormous benefit. I get the question asked, too, sort of the converse of that question is are dynasties good for the league. My ultimate view is competition is great for the league, and if as a result dynasties are made, I think that's great, too. So I'm not against seeing repeat championships."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"On the other hand, whoever wins this year it'll be the fifth consecutive year where we have a new team winning a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"So in assessing what discipline is appropriate, if that's the case, we look at both the history of prior acts, but then we look at the individual player's history, as well. And the seriousness, of course, of the conduct. Those are all things that get factored."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,It's not an exact science. It comes down to judgment at the end of the day on the part of me and my colleagues in the league office.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of the timing, we've uncovered a fair amount of additional information, I think, since I was first asked about the situation. I will say we probably could have brought it to a head now, but we made the decision, and I believe the Players Association agrees with us, that it would be unfair to these players and these teams in the middle of the series to announce the results of that investigation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Given that we're of course in the offseason, he has now been suspended by the Memphis Grizzlies indefinitely, so nothing would have changed anyway in the next few weeks. It seemed better to park that at the moment, at least any public announcement, and my sense now is that shortly after the conclusion of the Finals we will announce the outcome of that investigation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think, ultimately, progress has been so slow based on something that Stan Kroenke himself said to me even back more than a year ago, which is the situation here has been a bit of the canary in the mine in terms of the breakdown of the regional sports network model."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Of course what followed then, this impasse, was ultimately the bankruptcy of the so-called Diamond RSNs, 16 others. It's a terrible situation. The league office has tried to mediate several times between the parties. It's a commercial dispute. There hasn't been a simple resolution to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I know there's no doubt it's bad for fans, of course, and the team recognizes that. It's my hope, though, and one of the things that's changed considerably since this dispute has started is the advent of many more streaming platforms, better digital streaming technology."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"As we now embark on our negotiations for our new what we used to call our national deals, we have two years left with our existing partners -- I think Bill Koenig is here, our president of media -- it's a problem we have to fix."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I hope this is a period we look back on, as we say, where we went through a transition, and we got to a place where a fan, frankly, wherever they are can watch every game. Most likely it'll be through some sort of digital offering. When you think about those digital platforms, there's obviously no constraint in terms of individual channels and everything else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"It frustrates me because I think it's a broken economic model where you have demand and the supply isn't there, especially with a leading No. 1 seed team, Finals-caliber team here in Denver, the notion that local fans can't watch the games -- I have, incidentally, a brother who lives in Boulder, so I hear from him and his family all the time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,It makes no sense. It's on us to fix it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I'll rephrase your question. If that had been in effect this season, most of those players would, in fact, have been eligible for those awards. We're putting in place an incentive for players to play more games in the regular season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"There's no magic to the 65, but we're trying to take into account games, of course, that are going to be missed because there are injuries, and maybe occasionally even it's necessary for a player to rest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think, again, this is something we negotiated with the Players Association. Everybody has an interest in the league putting its best foot forward in a highly competitive regular season. That provision plus some others -- I think the Play-In, incidentally, had a huge impact at the end of the season. We're adding an In-Season Tournament."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We're hoping those various provisions plus, frankly, talking more about it as partners with the players, that people will understand that, especially to that earlier question about media, it's a changing media landscape, higher expectations from our fans, different pricing models for fans receiving games, that we're all going to have to play through the long grind, as Coach Spoelstra called it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But again, finding that right balance. That's why it's 65, not 75, because recognize players are going to get injured. And it may be that even if a player has been injured and is out for a significant number of games, we've all come to the conclusion that that player is just not eligible then, therefore, for those level awards."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I have enormous level of empathy. I wouldn't say it's concern, because when you look at the numbers, it's actually not that aberrational. You've been doing this a long time, too, David."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,There is that revolving door of coaches. What's interesting is some of those same championship coaches have already been hired on other teams. So it's a marketplace.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But again, I think that's something that ultimately has to be controlled by the teams. I am, though, just personally, because I've been at this a long time and they're personal friends, and I think sometimes I get it from a team or a fan standpoint you're doing everything you can to win, it's rough to get fired. It's rough on that coach's family. It requires dislocation. It's embarrassing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But the good news is seemingly the great coaches, the ones that have proven track records, get rehired somewhere else. I don't think they go from being championship-level coaches to bad coaches one or two seasons later. For whatever reason change is just necessary, a different voice. We all know how that works."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,But the good news is it seems that talent continues to get recognized and the great coaches get rehired somewhere else.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I'll just give you the other side of the coin, that all really a salary cap is is a mechanism for distributing the players' share of the total revenue. So in this case, and I think the coaches would take this deal any day of the week, the players receive roughly 50 percent of the gross revenue of this league. It's a formula we call BRI, but that's essentially how it works."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"As you know, there's all kinds of complexity to the salary cap system. But in essence, you take their 50 percent share and you divide it by 30, and that's the salary cap."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"While it has the word ""cap"" as part of it, it's misleading in that it's really a sharing mechanism. And what's so great about the system, one that I inherited and take no credit for, is it also creates maximum incentives because when we sit and we're negotiating with the Players Association, we see new opportunities -- take the Play-In or an In-Season Tournament -- they're our partners, and 50 percent of the revenue that we generate from those new activities then go to the players. It just gets expressed through the salary cap."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I pay attention to it, but it's a marketplace. We're able to negotiate collectively with the players because they choose to negotiate as a union. The coaches don't -- haven't made that election. They could form a union and come and negotiate their agreements collectively, but in the marketplace for coaches, we compete -- our teams compete individually, and it's where the marketplace takes us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think you could say it doesn't seem right as a societal matter, but this is a marketplace and it's a business. I don't think it's different than comparing teachers to bankers. We could go down the list, or journalists to players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We as the NBA made a decision, again, David Stern made that decision, to create the WNBA, to fund it at enormous cost, and we continue to support that league. But ultimately I think the women who play in that league would be the first to say they are not a charity. The goal is to turn this into a sustainable, independent business."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"The great news is that our commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, together with a strong Players Association, a fantastic group of women playing in that league, have made tremendous progress, particularly in the last few years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We saw record ratings for this draft that just passed, for this early game so far on ESPN, record ratings on CBS, as well. It's happening. It takes a long time. But I would only say we contribute an enormous amount, both in resources and actual dollars, to that league, and hopefully just as the NBA and certain other sports have grown over time, women's basketball will continue to grow, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, I think it's tremendous that the international players are committed to their countries. I think there's -- especially in terms of World Cup competition, they grew up in different traditions. Obviously, there's the World Cup of futbol, slash, soccer, it has a very meaning to them in terms of World Cup. I think we've seen Americans are more focused on Olympic competition. I think you've seen the commitment from our very best to compete in the Olympics and in certain cycles the World Cup, and not just once but multiple times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Frankly, if it were up to me, I would take one of those competitions, similar to what they've done in soccer, for example, where I think it's essentially 23-and-under for Olympic competition. I think it's too much to create the expectation that every two years that our best players are going back out and competing independently in the summer. Putting aside load management for a second, there's no question there's enormous wear and tear. It goes to the WNBA question about those women playing year-round. Their bodies just can't -- you need a rest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think here we should work with our federation ultimately, and whether it be the World Cup or whether it be the Olympics, maybe have one where it's unlimited in terms of age and your very best play, and then the other competition is one where your very best under 23 or something like that compete, and once you've done it, then their expectation is that you continue to compete."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"The other issue, of course, is international. There's just not as large a pool in many countries for that competition, too, so I think it's just that some of our international players have grown up literally as brothers with some of these players, so I think there's -- I wouldn't call it peer pressure. It's nationalism, too. But I think it's just an expectation that they're going to be out there competing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, one, I'm not going to speak for Michael Jordan. I never will. So, I'll let him answer a question what his current status is. I'd only say that just in the same way that it's wonderful that one of our greatest, Michael Jordan, could become the principal governor of a team, he has the absolute right to sell at the same time. Values have gone up a lot since he bought that team, so that is his decision."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"While he is our only principal African American owner right now, over the years, whether it's Grant Hill who's come in, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal owning a piece of the Atlanta Hawks -- I'm sorry, Sacramento Kings for Shaquille O'Neal. That's ongoing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I would love to have better representation in terms of principal governors. It's a marketplace. It's something that if we were expanding that the league would be in a position to focus directly on that, but in individual team transactions, the market takes us where we are."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I will say I know that increasingly our governors are focused on diversity in their ownership groups just as they are in their front office, so the trend lines have been positive over the last several years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I've thought about that, and Joe Dumars, who is here, was in the room with me when we met with Ja, and he's known Ja longer than I have. For me at the time, an eight-game suspension seemed very serious, and the conversation we had, and Tamika Tremaglio from the Players Association was there, as well, felt heartfelt and serious."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,But I think he understood that it wasn't about his words. It was going to be about his future conduct.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I guess in hindsight, I don't know. If it had been a 12-game suspension instead of an eight-game suspension, would that have mattered? I know it seemed based on precedent, and he's represented, and we want to be fair in terms of the league, it seemed appropriate at the time. That's all I can say. Maybe by definition to the extent we've all seen the video that it appears he's done it again, I guess you could say maybe not."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But I don't think we yet know what it will take to change his behavior. Same thing I said at the time he seems to be a fine young man. In terms of my dealings with him, I think he's clearly made some mistakes, but he's young, and I'm hoping now -- once we conclude at the end of our process what the appropriate discipline is, that it's not just about the discipline, it's about now what we, the Players Association, his team and he and the people around him are going to do to create better circumstances going forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,I think that's ultimately what's most important here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Yes, there's been discussion to the extent that's an issue that came up from the moment we put in place the structure. Again, you have the example here, right, we all talk about Miami Heat is the eighth seed, but they started as the seventh seed, and when they went to the Play-In, they lost the first game. And some of you may recall, I think they were down to the Chicago Bulls with less than three minutes to go in the second game. They ended up as the eighth seed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think from our standpoint, it's worked. I'm always, though -- I've acknowledged to the extent we should tweak certainly new things we put in place, we will. I think I'd rather have a few more seasons under our belt before we make additional changes, so right now it's something we're open to new ideas and discussion, but we think it's working pretty well right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,I'm not going to answer that yet. I think let's wait and see what the conclusion is of our investigation.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, it hasn't just been discussion, we've dramatically reduced the number of back-to-backs. We've eliminated four games in five nights -- that used to be a regularity in this league, and now we're down to math."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think it's the trade-off. Recall two seasons ago we played a 72-game season. In a way, it's not a perfect experiment because coming off the COVID season, so it was condensed in a way that -- as if we had changed and taken 10 games off the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But at least from that season-long experiment, it didn't change resting patterns all that much, and it didn't change injury patterns all that much. There is an economic factor, of course, that's being balanced in terms of playing a longer season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"What's interesting is that what we saw this year maybe surprised some, was all-time record attendance, more people attended NBA games than any time in our history. So clearly our fans aren't saying reduce the number of games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Ultimately, to me, as the science gets better on injuries, if we had better data that suggested a shorter season and fewer back to backs would make a significant difference, I think we would take that seriously."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Of course, the other issue other than the reducing the number of games, you could lengthen the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But I think, again, in talking to our teams and our players, one, it is already -- when you think of when training camp starts, essentially the end of September, and here we are almost in late June, so we're all still in the same season, plus you want to get in a Summer League for the incoming players, the players also want that chunk of time off on their bodies. That's what we didn't see when we were coming out of the Bubble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"It's just something we're constantly balancing. But we're always open as we learn more, and I think that AI is yet -- will add a new component to better understanding the data around injuries."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Remember with AI you can also digest video. And I think probably in the not far too distant future when a player tears his ACL, they're going to go back over multiple years and instantaneously through AI analyze the movement that that player was making with his left knee or whatever and conclude whether there was some indicia of something that if only the player were strengthening some muscle or something else could have avoided that injury."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Hopefully with all this new technology, we're going to keep our players on the floor longer and we won't need to modify the schedule."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's something that we've been working on, just bouncing back after runs, timeouts locking back in. So, I thought we did a good job of just executing after they went on runs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Because we have a big goal in mind. You can't dwell on the negative. If they're playing well, you've got to just do better and be in a better mindset to do it. You can't hang your head every timeout."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, I thought we did a good job after timeouts just coming in locked in. No matter what they do, just executing, and playing the way we play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,Yeah. Thank you for asking.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he's done amazing. Just like playing an all-around game, 12 boards, 14 points with basically one or two threes, getting to the rim, playing great defense, pursuing the ball. He's 6-10, he's doing more than just knocking down shots, and that's dangerous. When he's doing that, he's helping us a lot just being on the wing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Even if he's not shooting well, he's going to keep shooting and we're going to keep finding him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"That's just the way he plays the game. If the team is rolling, that's just how you play basketball. If everybody else is scoring, then there's no need to force it. He's a great passer, great facilitator. They're digging, they're doubling, they're trying not to let him score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, he's just playing the game and other guys are playing well. That's just the way he plays. Just let the game kind of come to him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he's a heavy guy. He's going to get boards and rebound the ball and just be physical down there regardless. Even if he's not shooting well or not scoring well, he's still a load down there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just playing the game. Whoever is open, whoever has the mismatch, that's just the way we play. If it's not Jokic, it's AG set the tone today. Sometimes I set the tone. Sometimes K is setting the tone. It could be anybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"I thought AG just did a good job of making an adjustment early in the game, just being tough down there and just being relentless. I think that set the tone for us to start the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I think we do a good job defensively just flying around, being on a string, not just tonight but all playoffs, all season. You can't be the No. 1 seed with just offense. That's hard to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Jokic has great hands down there. KCP is aggressive. Bruce is one of the best defenders. AG is one of the best defenders. So, we've got a lot of guys -- CB, we don't think he's a rookie. So, we've got a lot of guys that can come in and impact the game on defense and do a lot better than you think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, absolutely. Like I said, we're just reading the game. If they take the pocket away, we're looking somewhere else. If they take me away, then we're looking somewhere else. We're just trying to find the open man, find the best shot, find the mismatch. I think we do that throughout the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, it's hard to guard everybody, instead of just one or two guys. We make you have to be locked in on defense throughout the game. I think tonight was just a great example of it could be anybody's night and anybody's quarter, maybe not your quarter. That's just Nuggets basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just ball movement. Playing Nuggets basketball. That's just the way we play. Find the open man, hit the open man, take the open shot. I think we do a good job of just keeping the ball hopping, and during our offense it doesn't get stagnant. It's tough to guard, like I said, everybody instead of just one or two guys, and that's why the guys are getting open shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Hard worker, loves basketball, dedicated. I don't think he gets enough credit for how well he's played through, how many injuries he's been through. We were out together for a while, and just to see him bounce back, every time that he's been hurt, I think he's pretty impressive. He's only getting better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Shout-out to Mike. He's done a great job just having an all-around game. Even when he's not shooting the ball well, he's impacting the game in different ways. We going to need more of that. He's done a great job, not just this game but all year, of impacting the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,I think we're doing a good job.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was cool. Finals, Eastern Conference, first round, second round, we just want to win a championship, doesn't matter what series. I think it's just fluent, beautiful basketball. The ball is hopping and we're just playing off each other. You can have a great game with only five shots until the fourth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just making reads on the basketball court. I think that's the beauty of what this team is, we have so many different weapons and so many different looks, like I said, you've got to guard to everybody. Jokic dominated until the fourth quarter, and it didn't even feel like it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it's free flowing, and it's a lot of fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, a lot of confidence. We had eight new guys come to this team at the start of the year. I thought we did a great job of building the chemistry and continuity of how we want to play, and everybody is buying in, and you could see it's paying off if we just play the right way, everybody stay patient, you're going to get good looks, get good shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Our core has been playing like this for years, from Mike to me, to Jokic, Mike, we've been doing this for a while. Our timing is great, and our pace is great, so I think it's just almost natural, the way we play. Our reads, it's not a stagnant offense, it's not a set offense. If somebody else is open, we play it through. It's nice to make reads like that during the game instead of just running a set play and just kind of just go through the motions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, this did a great job of just junking up the game -- zone, press, man, double, no double. We knew they were going to do that. That's how they play and that's how they win games, is just be relentless in that sense. They had that 8-0 run to start the fourth, and we just locked back in and took care of the ball and found the best shot. I think once we do that, once we play the way we play, it doesn't really matter what the other team does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, a lot of the focus is on ourselves and not turning the ball over and giving them one shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, those are sets. We're making reads. Like I said, we're just making reads. If I'm not open, somebody else is open if I cut."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just making reads, playing basketball, and had nine days off, so got to show off my little left leg over there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"The number of people that I've heard from in this run has been incredible, from high school teammates, college teammates, coaches, as you mentioned. Most people have an opinion, and everybody wants a ticket. I give them the 1-800 ticket number."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,But it's been really neat to hear from coaches that have had an impact on my career and probably -- my father being the number one. It's been since game one of year one all the way up until this point.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So when I hear from, yes, my father, Brendan Malone, but also guys like Gregg Popovich and other coaches that you've come across in many years, even my high school coach Bobby Farrell, that means a lot. I think people are proud of the journey and they all understand that we have a lot of work in front of us, and we're not satisfied."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But when you get to a stage like this, people that are reaching out, it does mean a lot, and I am thankful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I'm not really sure in terms of Jamal's stats over the last few years against Miami. I know we as a team have had good stats against Miami, which is the most important thing. It's the collective and not the individual."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"We know they're a very good defensive team. We know, more than Minnesota, Phoenix and L.A., we're going to see a lot more different types of defenses, things that we've worked on the last few days."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But one thing I do know about Jamal, if he has a bad game or somebody is doing something to take him out of his game, he's going to figure it out. I think in just these 15 games that we've played in this postseason, I think we've seen that quite a few times in each round."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Teams think they've kind of figured him out or an individual defender may think they've figured him out, and then Jamal will just go into a 23-point fourth quarter or score 30 points in the first half, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,I have all the confidence in the world that Jamal is going to be ready for this stage.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's been the constant, from that first Summer League in Vegas up until today. You could tell early on that he had a very good feel for the game, a high IHe was not only a willing passer, but I think he's always taken more joy in making plays for his teammates than he does for himself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whether he was maybe not in the best shape of his life or he got in peak conditioning, that never changed. I think that's kind of the one constant."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's really funny, I was hanging out with one of my daughters last night, and she said, Are you nervous? And I said, You know what's really funny? I'm not. I said, I think the reason that I'm not nervous is because I know we're prepared."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"It is accurate. I was jealous because every time I saw the Heat staff, they had like three or four bottles of wine. They were sitting in the middle of one of the little lakes there in our detention center."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then there's this loop around where we were, and every night like me and Spo would run into each other. I would be on my bike, he would be walking and we'd get to talking to each other. We were in Africa together for one of the BWB trips. We have a relationship. We have a respect for each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Obviously you look at his body of work and his career, I think most coaches would aspire to do, accomplish what Erik has accomplished."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Lasting image, yeah. Eighty-three days in the bubble away from family, away from friends, and probably I think the biggest thing I can take away from being in the bubble was just how proud I was of our group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you recall, we were down 3-1, not just the first round, but the second round. A lot of people have said since the bubble ended that they just wanted to get the hell out of there. And our guys had ample opportunity to let go of the rope and say, Man, I am tired of this, I want to go home. Especially down 3-1. They never did that. They stayed the course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That to me was so impressive to be a part of a group that believed, never gave up and fought its way to a Western Conference Finals. Just how proud I was of that group is probably what I take more than anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I do it often. It's funny, when you're a young coach, you're always trying to learn from other people and other great coaches and take things from them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I remember reading something about Pat Riley, and he talked how he would quiz his players often. You think the main reason you're quizzing them is to see if they are locked in, focused and paying attention. That's part of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I thought the second part of Pat Riley's reasoning for doing that was really -- what stuck with me is that it also allows you to see if you're doing your job as a coach. If they don't know the answers, you've failed, not just them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"It is something that, being around Jeff Van Gundy, being around coaches throughout my career, quizzing them, keeping them on their toes, keeping them sharp, making sure they're locked in. And at this stage, we can't be spoon-feeding guys. They have to take accountability and ownership for themselves. That's why I said this morning our guys were pretty impressive because every question that I asked was answered with a correct answer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, we're going to find out. It's going to be one of two things. They have tremendous rhythm. They played a seven-game Eastern Conference championship. We've had 10 days off."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the 10 days, we've tried to be really smart with giving guys a break, with the delicate balance of, while giving them a break mentally and physically, also making sure we're conditioned and maintaining our rhythm as best as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,You can't replicate game rhythm without playing a game. We tried to do the best job we could do. So we're going to find out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Going into the first round against Minnesota we had the same thing, like a week to get ready, not knowing who we were playing. Our guys attacked that week with the same voracity as we did this past week."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,I expect our guys to be fully ready to go out there and be excited to play in front of the best fans in the world.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's where your principles come into play. When you have principles that you believe in and you bring to work every day, regardless of the result, regardless of the outcome, based on that result, you can go home that night and know you did the best job to the best of your ability."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"You're right, in this last month or so you see the guys that have gotten fired and their achievements and their track record. I can't say it's surprising. I grew up in this business. I saw my father get fired. I've been fired. It's kind of something that you know is going to happen at some point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think for me, it's staying true to yourself and not compromising yourself ever. And if you do that, I think your body of work will speak for itself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Like Monty Williams. Good friend. Congratulations. I've got to hit him up, I need a loan. But Monty is doing all right for himself. He got fired in Phoenix. Okay, well, Detroit realized here's a guy that is not only a great coach but more importantly he's going to be a great example for our team and help a bunch of young players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that's all you want. If it doesn't work out in one place, you know that 29 other teams are watching to see maybe that guy could work here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I'll say on this is, and I have to say it because it's true, for me, I've been very fortunate. Tim Connelly hired me and Josh and Stan Kroenke have believed in me since day one and have allowed me to get to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Most coaches don't get eight years. Right now it's Pop, it's Spo, it's Steve Kerr and myself. The fact that I'm one of the top four longest-tenured coaches, that has a ton to do with where we are today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I couldn't be more thankful for working for an ownership group that is not impatient and is not trying to find the next great thing, but, hey, listen, let's let this grow and marinate into something special. I've benefited from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think it's a really interesting question. For Nikola, starting with him, that's probably the thing I marvel at most is over eight years, how consistently great he has been. For him to do it every single night, that is a talent. That is a skill that only historically great players are able to do every night, bring that greatness."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, to be averaging a triple-double in the NBA Playoffs heading into the Finals, I think only a few guys named Wilt and Magic have done that in the past. So he's up there with the greatest players of all time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"And with Jamal, I think the last time we saw this was when we were in the bubble. That was the last Playoffs he participated in prior to this year. For Jamal, it just seems like as the stakes get higher and the stage gets bigger, he embraces that. He doesn't shy away from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think more than anything, it's a mentality. It's an inner belief and a confidence that they have in themselves and their teammates, and they go out there and continue to show and prove every single night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's why I'm just so excited to watch our team in these Finals. We know it's going to be the hardest challenge of our lives. KCP is the only world champion on our team, and hopefully in the next couple of weeks we can find a way to bring the first championship here to Denver."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, there were a lot of things that I liked. To hold that team to 93 points, only 40 from the field, 33 from the three-point line, which is below their 39 percent in the Playoffs, and probably the most impressive defensive stat was only two free throw attempts. I think we got there 20 times. We know Jimmy Butler is one of the best in the business at getting to the foul line, so two free throw attempts. I thought our guys did a great job of defending without fouling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, I thought for three quarters, our defense was where it needed to be. Fourth quarter, 60 percent allowed, 30 points, and I think as I told our players, we're up 1-0, that's great, but we have to close games out. We're up 21 to start that fourth quarter, and they open up with a quick 8-0 run, turnover, layup. We missed a few open shots against the zone, gave up some threes. In the Finals you can't pick and choose when you want to play. We've got to play much closer to 48 minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That was one of my last messages to the group before our game. I reminded our group, if they didn't know that Miami went into Milwaukee and won Game 1. They went into the Garden in New York City and won Game 1. They won Game 1 up in Boston. So, we did not want them coming in here taking control of the series on our court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Proud of our guys for going out there and getting the win. Michael Porter, a double-double. Jamal Murray, double-double. Nikola, triple-double. I felt Aaron Gordon's play on both ends of the floor in that first half really set the tone, and I thought Bruce was really good off the bench."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"This was everybody stepping up, doing their job, but knowing that we can all be a lot better come Sunday."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think Aaron -- we always talk about Nikola embodying Nuggets culture, and I think Aaron Gordon is a prime example of somebody who's truly selfless. He understood with Jamal and Michael coming back this year being healthy that his role was going to change. He never once fought it. He's embraced it from day one of the season and gone out there, whether it's guarding Karl-Anthony Towns, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and now obviously guarding a guy like Jimmy Butler. He does a lot of the dirty work for us, and a lot of times he doesn't get the credit that he deserves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"They were switching early on and I felt he was really big in terms of sitting down in front of the rim, scoring in the paint and finishing at the rim. And again, just his effort on the defensive end was just another example of his importance to our group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, you've got to read the game. If you're giving up tough mid-range contested twos, that's better than them getting a lot of open threes. Obviously, we can do a better job of contesting some of those mid-range shots that Bam was getting, and I think we have to mix up our levels. To your point, Kyle Lowry, Gabe Vincent, they hit a couple of pull-up threes. I was imploring our guys, imploring Nikola to be up higher. When you do that, now Bam gets behind you and you have to trust your low man and trust your weak-side help. In that fourth quarter, I felt once we were at the level, I thought we had some pretty good examples of helping on that roll and disrupting their offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, as I said earlier, I felt Aaron really kind of set the tone on both ends of the floor for us. He's done that all year long, whether it's in transition versus a cross match sitting down posting up a smaller guy, sealing him in the paint, going up strong. They switched a few of the pick-and-rolls early, sitting down, posting up, finding him. And then giving us a great defensive effort against arguably one of the best players in the NBA right now in Jimmy Butler."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"We're a team and give Bam Adebayo credit. He did a really good job of making Nikola's catches hard. He fronted him a lot in that first quarter throughout the game. So, we needed other guys to step up. If you're going to take away Nikola, then find a way to get somebody else open and let them get off, and Aaron obviously benefitted from that and did a hell of a job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I really wasn't, and the reason I say that is because end of the regular season and before we played Game 1, Round 1 against Minnesota, we had the same thing, we had like a week to get ready. For much of that week, like this series, we didn't know who we were playing. But our guys were so locked in going into that Game 1 and I felt since we got back to practice after that Lakers series, our guys have been the same way, man. They've been so locked in. Every day in practice, I haven't had to push them, encourage them. They're bringing it. Tonight, obviously was great to see after such a long break, getting off to the start that we did."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's the beauty of Nikola. I learned a long time ago the defense tells you what to do, and Nikola never forces it. If they're going to give him that kind of attention, he had 10 assists at halftime, I believe. Well, he's going to just pick you apart. Now it's up to the other guys to step in and make shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it was the fourth quarter, we got into the bonus early. I was trying to post him up, get him the ball, tried to screen Bam, so he could catch the ball in a scoring area and let Nikola do what he does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I don't think he cares if he scored 27 points or not. He cares that we're up 1-0. I think everybody in that locker room realizes that yes, we need Nikola, but Michael Porter's double-double, Jamal's double-double, Bruce's 10 and 5 off the bench. This is a team. We have some really talented players, but we need everybody in that locker room to do their jobs, to try to go and get game No. 2 on Sunday night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yes, I can't bail them out every time. I called a timeout after the 8-0 run in the third. I called a few in the fourth, but at some point, also our guys have to take ownership. If you're going to win a championship, you need the five guys on the floor to step up, take accountability and make sure we execute and get the best shot on offense and get stops defensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To our guys' credit, they cut it but we were able to withstand that and wind up pulling away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, it's where it needs to be. I think we're past the point of praising Michael when he has a good defensive game. He needs to, as does everybody else on our team. This is the NBA Finals. We showed one of those at halftime where they ran a pick-and-roll for Jimmy Butler, Michael tried to get under, stayed in the play and wound up blocking Jimmy from behind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So those are the plays that Michael and everybody else needs to play for us to win this series. It can't be like, hey, look at Michael Porter, he's doing a great job. That is his job, and it's Jamal's job and Pope's job and Nikola, Aaron and everybody else that plays for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I don't know if it's like -- he's even aware of that. Like I don't think he gets up more for Game 1 than Game 2. I think it speaks to 7 to 10 days in between games. I think that allowed us to get some quality rest mentally, physically, emotionally and get ready for tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"As I said pregame, I wasn't sure what was going to happen when the game started, because we had such a long break. But I'm not surprised that Jamal had the game that he had. He got us going early, made big shots late. And when you have 26 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, that's a hell of a performance in your first game of the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,Their run was to be expected. That team is a really good team. That's the best team out of the Eastern Conference. So you're not just going to win by 20 points and they're not going to go quietly into that good night. They're going to be there. They're going to scratch and claw to get back in the game like they did tonight.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I fully expected that. They're a well-coached team, and they're here for a reason. We knew they'd make a run, and what's it going to take on Sunday night? They're going to come out and try to jump all over us and take control of the series and that game early on, and we have to be ready for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"We did Gave it to Aaron Gordon. I made the point that when you hold a team in the NBA Finals to 93 points, 40 from the field, 33 from the three-point line and only two free throw attempts, could have given it to the whole team tonight. I thought a lot of guys had really good defensive games, taking away that fourth quarter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So yes, Aaron got it. I thought he did a hell of a job taking on that challenge of guarding a guy like Jimmy Butler, but I felt as a group, a collective unit, I felt our guys did a hell of a job, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,KYLE LOWRY,We fought. The second half was a lot smoother for us. We played a little bit better. We found a little bit of rhythm and we got great shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,KYLE LOWRY,I think we just played a little bit harder. A little bit more attention to detail.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,KYLE LOWRY,Same thing. But I am going to take my dinner and chill out for a couple days.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, to be honest, I couldn't wait to start just because when the game started it felt abnormal. Everything else didn't feel -- felt abnormal, and the whole media day yesterday or the day before, it was -- I think people are making something bigger than it is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, exactly. I don't force it. I never force it, I think. It was a couple guys had it going, AG was playing really good, and we had advantage there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,I just take whatever the game gives me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, that's what they're doing. That's why they're great. They're really intelligent. Everybody knows what they are doing. That's a hard team to beat because they keep playing the same way the whole game, and they're really, really smart about how they're doing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He didn't ask me nothing, so I don't know. I think we did a good job, but guys were focused on how it was supposed to be. We were really, really focused and locked into the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Oh, I love to play with him. I love to play with some -- I want to say dominant big men, if that makes any sense. But he's really -- the best thing he did is accepting his role, and he's really doing a great job of that. Like today he got it going. We were just getting him the ball, and he was really good in the paint today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's our best defender probably, him and KCP, and just to play defense the whole game on the best player, I think that's really hard to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we are playing that way -- I am playing with Jamal that way a long time ago. I think everybody kind of -- I think they like it just because they are touching the ball. It's not like you just catch and shoot. I think to have the opportunity to touch the ball, to do something with it, to take advantage, create an advantage. I think we are playing a really nice brand of basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He had a couple of mid-range shots. I think he was supposed to make that. He's shooting the ball really well, and we all want him to shoot those kind of shots. He's really good at mid-range. He's really good at threes, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But as long as he's -- I think the whole Playoffs, he's playing really well, and creating for himself and for his teammates really nice looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't say that. I said we're playing good brand of basketball, not beautiful and not great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That's how I learned to play basketball, and I think it's really nice to play -- it's really hard to guard when you don't know who's going to attack and how to defend when everybody is moving, everybody is doing something. I think it's a really nice brand of basketball that we have, and everybody buys in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I'm not sure that I did that for us or whatever, but I think everybody contributed and everybody accepted it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Uh-uh. I mean, no. We have veterans doing a really good job and they are really pointing the main things. If you listen to them, it's really smart what they are saying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, that's a really good sentence about him. Really good, actually. I agree with that. Just because he's everything, what he's doing, it's aggressive, defensively, offensively. He's a champion. He won a couple things before coming here, so he knows what to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,That's a really good sentence. We don't look at him as a rookie.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Mike was 2-for-11, and I thought he made like seven threes. Crazy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, that's going to help us, especially the way, how they're attacking the glass, Bam, Jimmy, and to be on everybody, even Caleb Martin. Even Lowry he's always hanging out trying to steal some rebounds. But he's a big body, and he can help us on the glass, both sides."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Yeah. I mean, it's equal opportunity for the most part. But we're going through big fella. So big fella makes the right play, makes the right read, and he's just so smart, he's so cerebral out there, such a floor general, and Mal is floor general, too. If you make the right read or make the right cut or set the right screen, you're going to be open, and the ball moves, the ball finds the open man. The open man is the right play, and that's how we play the game, and it's a fun way to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Well, it's really a team effort. I think the Defensive Player of the Game could have gone to Michael Porter, too. He really stepped up on the defensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,We're switching a lot. Everybody is helping. We're shrinking. We're stunting for the stunter. It's not just a one-on-one game. I've been saying that all week. It's a team effort to slow that guy Jimmy Butler down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I'm not here for the credit. I'm here for the wins. Playing with guys like the guys that are on this team is just a blessing. It's a beautiful opportunity to play with guys on the team that have so much talent, have so much skill and have so much passion for the game of basketball. That's what I've always loved is to play the right way of basketball, and we do that here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I don't care if I score 50 or 0, as long as I'm helping impact the game and we're winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Not yet. Not yet. I'm definitely going to be sitting in my rocking chair when I'm 79, 90 years old, talking to my kids like, back in the day I locked these guys up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"It's just part of the game. I'm doing what my team needs me to do, and like I said, it's a team effort. It always is. It takes five guys out there to play a complete defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"No, this is just Denver Nugget basketball. We find a mismatch, we exploit it, and we keep going to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,I was just taking what the defense was giving me and just attacking what I felt was a mismatch.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Loved his pace tonight, just the pace that he played all night long, the tempo that he played at, controlling the game and controlling the flow of the game was great. His timely shot-making and his distribution of the basketball was very important, very crucial for this win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Well, you've got to want it, first and foremost. A lot of guys don't really care about the defensive side of the floor. Just effort, the want, the energy. That's where it starts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Then after that, it takes knowing the personnel, and then it takes technique."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Mike played an incredible game tonight. Just so well rounded and so balanced. Affected the game in so many different areas, and he's just getting better and better on the defensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Oh, most definitely. He's a force down there, and he's just more athletic than people give him credit for, and he just has a ridiculous motor. He has a motor that just doesn't quit. It's tough guarding a guy like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"It was awesome. The crowd was super cool tonight. It was just like -- it was beautiful. I took a moment during the National Anthem was like wow, this is really the NBA Finals, and it's really, really cool. The crowd was in it from the start, giving us that extra juice. They've been awesome all year, and they just turned it up another notch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, it's just an exciting brand of basketball. It's a lot of fun out there just to be battling with my guys. Yeah, winning is always fun, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"No, I think I was pretty prepared. I was really excited, but it was very fun out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"No, just taking advantage of my physicality out there. Like I said, just taking what the defense was giving me and just trying to put my head down and get to the cup, avoid charges, and just really set the tone for our team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,Most definitely. You've got to play to your advantages at this time of year and all the time. I was just looking to play to my advantages.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"We don't want to change too much. We want to go back to the film and look where we can get better. If we're looking to improve, I think we're in a good place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I was surprised. I was like, whoa, my man got VertiMax, man. Not the usual dunk. But Jamal is like a sleepy athlete. He will dunk you for real. That was crazy. It was like, yeah, all vert."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Well, Blue Arrow is one of the best guards in the league and one of the best scorers in the league. He has a way about him, he has a discipline about him that when he's locked in, when he's engaged, he's up there with the best players in the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Felt great. I think everybody felt great. Missed some shots, didn't get back a little bit, but overall I feel like everybody's wind was good. Everybody was moving well. We just lost the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, they are a physical group. I think we had to adjust to their physicality early, especially myself. They had a couple lay-ups on me early that we had to adjust to. But, you know, it's a long series, first to four wins, adjustments will be made, and we'll learn from this loss."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, I've got a lot of hair on my head so my head is doing all right, thankfully."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,But they are a good team. They are well-coached. They are talented. It's going to be a challenge. It's the Finals. We don't expect it any other way. We are looking forward to Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I definitely think they came out with a lot of physicality, and we have to be able to match that. They did their job on their home floor, you have to say that, but we will be ready. Like he said, we will adjust, and we will do some things very differently and come out here and be ready to give more for Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Probably because we shot a lot of jumpshots, myself probably leading that pack, instead of putting pressure on the rim, getting lay-ups, getting to the free throw line. When you look at it during the game, they all look like the right shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"And I'm not saying that we can't as a team make those, but got to get more layups, got to get more free throws. And whenever you miss and don't get back, the game gets out of hand kind of quickly. We gave up too many lay-ups which we also can't have happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"But that's it as a whole. We've got to attack the rim a lot more, myself included."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I think we are always trying to find Bam, and the way they guard, he tended to be open with some of our sets a bit, and he made some good reads tonight, and he made some shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,He's aggressive. We're going to need him to continue to be aggressive and continue to attack and continue to make the right reads for us.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I agree. When Bam is making shots, I think he makes everybody's job a lot easier. We want him to continually be aggressive, and he was making, you know, the right passes when he couldn't get a bucket, as well, and those shots will fall for everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Next game, stay with it and keep playing that style of basketball. But in the end, if we guard better, not give up so many layups, get back, I think the game is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,He's comfortable and confident. He shoots the ball very well. He cuts to the rim. He guards. He does anything and everything that you ask him to do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Tonight he spaced the floor incredibly well. He had some timely cuts, some stops, some hustle plays. And that's what made his mark in this league for him, and he's continuing to do it, even in the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, he's talented. He's an MVP. He's going to make plays. He's going to be great at times. We just have to continue to make it difficult, be physical with him when we can, like we mentioned, take away the layups and try to take away these cuts and attack him on offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think it was a focus in Game 1. Obviously it will be a focus in Game 2 as well. We've just got to be better and put body on body and make sure that we're challenging everything at the rim, not giving up back-cuts and slips for open threes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think whenever we watch this film, it's going to look way worse than it really is, but that's the only way you're going to learn from it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think I've done well in that area. I'm always going to pass the ball to my teammates. I have so much belief and faith in them that they are going to take and make shots, and if they can't, then they are going to make the next play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's how we have been playing all year long. That's not going to change now that we are in the Finals. Maybe I have to be a little bit more aggressive. I've got to put pressure on the rim. Me with no free throws, that was all on myself, nobody else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"So we'll definitely correct that the next game, but only I can do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"Jamal is a talented player. He can score in a number of ways. I think one of the things that makes him difficult to guard is when he gets off the ball, and then you have to deal with the cuts and he's circling back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"And they know they are looking for him. So when he's off the ball, you already know the ball is going to end up in his hands at some point. He's a dynamic scorer. He poses threats in different ways and he's relentless."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, they complement each other very well. They are both three-level scorers. They can both use the pick-and-roll. One setting it, one coming off of it, vice versa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me. But to my teammates and the fans there, they're getting a big-time player and even better person. Just somebody who is going to bring it every day, push the people around me. Just someone that is going to work hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really proud of what our owners -- this is something, the owners actually appoint and pay the coaches, that our owners have stepped up to do. I think it's something we have our eye on, we had our eye on as soon as I came into the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sport is something that always in Serbia was something that put in front of us everybody, even like 10, 20 years ago, whatever, but now when we have Djokovic who won, probably the best ever. For us he's the best ever of course, and now we have our NBA championship, and I think it's a really good moment to be a Serbian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,It's like four or five.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day. Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career. I'm not worried about this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think as a group, I think we've found ways that we've gotten great looks. I think we've found a little bit of a rhythm offensively. We haven't made all the shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,Also just taking our time and trying to get this win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the moment, it's us, our coaching staff, our players. But this was for all Nuggets. That was what was really cool about it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I wouldn't say that it was a lineup change. I get what you're saying. We just went back to our original lineup. We went with this lineup for 14 games. I didn't have the foresight, I didn't. That's on me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I've heard that. Yeah, I don't know. Just my father's last name, as well. I don't know. I guess I've got like H's in my family or something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just an amazing duo. They've been together for the longest, and just how comfortable they are with each other and how they know each other's tendencies and what works for them and us as a team. It was just truly amazing to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"That's three 6'9"", 6'10"", 6'11"" guys who can dribble, pass and shoot, have high II think that's going to be a huge advantage for us and a struggle for other teams to game plan for."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"Yeah, super, super looking forward to it. Super excited about, just playing in the league in general. Just super excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, we have player personnel sheets and booklets essentially that we can go through and study players' tendencies, what their strengths are, what they like to get to, how they're most effective. Then I just kind of go through that, treat it like a Bible for the next couple of days and just stick to the script."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"For sure. It's something I take pride in, the defensive end. Having that opportunity, having that role, is something I'm really looking forward to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I think it's a standard that we hold ourselves to and that we have held ourselves to all year long. We've been building habits day in and day out. So, you get to a game like this, the biggest stage in basketball, you let your standard of play and you let your habits carry you."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I had a feeling from the information I was being told is that it was just kind of up in the air. Orlando wasn't really sure yet, and just to be ready for whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, to be honest, it's something that -- since year one, whoever was kind of speaking my language or I'm trying to kind of stay in touch or whatever, some guys maybe a little bit more, some guys a little bit less, but I'm trying to stay in touch with everybody."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, I think I knew the Fever were interested, but you never know until draft night obviously happens. I wasn't getting my hopes up or anything like that. Was just keeping an open mind."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We decided that given that investigation was ongoing and it remains ongoing, that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to work in these Finals. I don't know what the ultimate conclusion will be. We'll see where the facts take us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, I think that's -- Nikola never tries to impose his will or force things that aren't there. He's going to read the game. He's going to make the right play. Most importantly he's going to make every one of his teammates better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I think defensively he is definitely one of the best defenders out there. I credit that to his IQ but also his activeness with his hands.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think it's an opportunity to learn. You watch the film, go to school on it, try to take away some things that you did well, and then certainly learn from some things that you can do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, it seems like they've prioritized that, just maybe helping a little bit less on drives and staying home a little bit more. So it's an adjustment. It's something that we're used to and we feel like we can still generate good three-point looks. It's just going to be a matter of running good, crisp offense with pace, full court and half court, and then just playing to our strengths."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I really haven't thought about free agency at all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, there's lots of moments, kind of when there's a pause in the action, I guess, if you will, to kind of step back and be appreciative of the journey. When you're in it throughout the day to day, you're just focused on what's next. Obviously your perspective shifts and changes as you advance in your career and you want more for yourself, because we're all competitive people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Sometimes a dream is deferred, and our dream was deferred for a few years, but we stuck with it, and we added the right pieces. Huge shoutout to Calvin Booth and the job he's done. This is just an unbelievable feeling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,P-Wat has a great feel for the game and a chance to be a really great player for this team and to help this team along the way. I'm excited for P-Wat and the experience that he has gathered thus far.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Just enjoying and embracing this moment, I think that was the biggest lesson. I feel like I truly embraced it. I was very excited just to see my name pop up. It didn't matter if it was first round, second round. I'm just excited to be here. I know they're going to be always around me. I'm always going to be part of the Huskies family. I can always go talk to coaches, call them whenever, even the alums. It's just a big family. So it's nice to have them as my support group that I can always go to and ask questions about the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, when you play a team numerous times in a row, you've got to know what's coming. They know what we're doing, we know what they're doing. We're going to keep adjusting, mixing things up, but everybody is -- he's locked in. KCP is -- it's a defensive game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Not too much. The main focus through this pre-draft process was everything on the court. That's what it's always going to be for me, just keeping the main thing the main thing. But obviously there's stuff to talk about off the court. So later on the road, obviously. But as of now, I'm excited to get out there tomorrow. I can't really put into words how I'm really feeling about it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Tim Connelly hired me and brought me to the table here, and my countless conversations in my seven years with Tim, we would always talk about how we had the luxury of working for a group with Stan and Josh and the Kroenke family that is not going to be just a quick trigger. We have to make a move. We have to make a move. They were willing to take a step back and see this thing through."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and all of our head and assistant coaches, I'd like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, John Hareas, Mike Levine, Mark Broussard and so many people at the NBA, and for all the league support and assistance in providing this tremendous platform for our great coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Everything, man. We were there I think for five days. We saw Christ the Redeemer, we went to different beaches, different places to eat, as well as seeing all the basketball fans over there and how the game has grown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"So really excited to be drafted, excited to get to Dallas and get into training camp."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Las Vegas tell us that we were underdog before. That doesn't... It's not correct, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,The day I walked through the doors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Nah. I had one of my high school teammates who played for the Heat at the time, so I saw him a lot. But other than that, no."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with. So I'm fortunate enough to be able to be the one right now that's in the limelight, to be able to represent our area the best I can, and I look forward to being able to represent Miami, as well, and trying to get this title."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well."
