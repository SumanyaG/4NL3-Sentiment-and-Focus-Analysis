2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,The main goal for us was to win a championship. We weren't -- we didn't care who got Finals MVP. I know that I need him through this journey and he needs me.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So, you know, it was great to see him have that moment and share that moment with him. I'm extremely happy for him. Well-deserved. That was big-time. He earned that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Man, from day one when I came in, my mindset was I'm going to give everything to this team and this city to try to win a championship here because I knew these guys have already been so close.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, once I got hurt, it was a heartbreaking moment for me. I didn't want to accept the truth. It was like, no way it happened, right.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"But, yeah, tonight was the night. I was like, listen, I'm going to give it everything I have. And, yeah, I'm just super happy to be a part of this and give something to the team, and I'm super thankful for the support I've gotten from the fans. And tonight the arena was electric. It's been unbelievable playing in front of these fans.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know what, like since last game, I've been thinking about, like, how can I get my body ready for next game. Like, no matter how it is. And today I was like, I'm going to try everything possible to get out there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"So from this morning, I was preparing myself that I will go out there. And, yeah, the medical staff was, like, unbelievable support for me and got me back out there somehow.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"And, man, I'm super thankful for them. And, yeah, I gave everything I could. I gave everything I could. And, man, it feels great to be a champion.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, we have like a super-composed team. We don't have any like, loud, like, guys. Like, we're super confident but also, like, down-to-earth people in this organization and in this roster.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Everybody had the mindset of, like, we are going to do whatever it takes, each of us individually, to get the job done. Like, we want to win a championship for this city.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"And everything, you know -- we did everything possible for that, and now we get the fruits from our labor.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, finally, finally, man. It was a long road to get here, to be honest. To be the last team standing, it feels amazing. Like, all that work paid off.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"As I said, when I was still on stage and stuff, like it still felt surreal. Like, I couldn't -- and us as a team, I think we couldn't really, like, settle into that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"But then once we got back to the locker room and started celebrating, I think that's when everybody realized we actually did it. We did it. And, yeah, Joe is an animal.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I know, great question. Al is an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable person. Everybody loves him. He's a great leader. You know, knowing how he has been chasing this for so long in his career and finally get it done, and playing at a high, high level at his age, man, I don't even know, like, words I could use to describe him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know, everybody loves him. And he gave everything to this team. He deserves it more than anybody.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,No. Laughter.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, obviously, like, what was put out, it was the truth. It was, like, something torn. And then my tendon is just out of place. And it, like, pretty much hurts on every step. Like, I would take a walk in Dallas, and my leg would swell up.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I was like, I don't know how I'm going to play, if I'm going to play. But my mindset was always, I'm going to try to find a way how I can manage this.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"And, yeah, somehow I got it going for this game. A lot of it was for sure like the adrenaline from just playing at the Garden and playing in front of our fans and having that opportunity to close it out. And, man, I got it going.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Good question. I don't know how to answer it yet, to be honest. I think I'm going to need a little bit of time, and then I can kind of reflect.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Because right now I'm just so in the moment and enjoying this. Man, this team, like, you know, it's just a special team and, like, everybody gave whatever they could for us to get here. And right now, we are just so in the moment. I think once I'm back home and settled, everything settles, I'll be able to compare better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's available. Expect to see him tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Have faith and execute what's necessary to win Game 5.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it wasn't necessarily Game 4. It was the time after Game 3 leading up to our time together yesterday. So, I think it's just kind of getting the general temperature of the team. Kind of figuring out where we're at. And, you know, regardless of where we are at, the series, you always have small resets like that throughout anything.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,So thought that was just kind of the temperature of our team and making sure we are in the proper space to be ready to execute.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It feels good. I think the most important thing, something that's really been going through my mind throughout this process, is you can't lose sight of the people that came before us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"And I want to make sure every person that's worked for the Celtics, that's played for the Celtics that didn't win, knows that their work and what they have done has not gone unnoticed or it doesn't play a part in where we are at today.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It can be so easy when you work for this organization and you don't win that the work that people put in just gets brushed over or gets ignored. And when I first got here, the staff, you know, Brad's coaching, the staff that they had, the foundation that they built with these guys when they were young, the foundation of what we have, is one of the reasons why we're here today.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think that's one of the first things that came to mind, was just because we won this doesn't mean what the people have done before us isn't just as important.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yes. Payton is one of the best competitors and one of my favorite people in the world. Just the way he competes, the professionalism and just for his ability to take pride in stuff like that. He's really grown as a player this year to becoming a well-rounded player on both ends of the floor, and he won us games.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think he won us moments. You know, as the playoffs go on, obviously some patterns change and things change, but those guys have to win moments of games for you, and Payton did that twice for us. That is just as important as any other plays that happened throughout the series and in the playoffs alone. You know, I've got a huge heart for him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It really starts with them. You can't have a philosophy or a way of playing if you don't have a group of guys that are willing to buy into it and be disciplined. Quite honestly, this group of guys has been through so much in the league, they know what it takes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's more about that. When you have a group of guys that have an understanding of what it takes, using the experiences that you've been through. And that, to me, is more than anything.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It was a joy watching the guys just grow as a team throughout the year but also like really work at it. Like, there's a group of guys in the locker room that decided they wanted to win day one, and credit to them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"That was awesome. It's a huge credit to him. Like I said, I know he's been in and out in the playoffs, but he's worked his ass off to try and get in and play as much as he could.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It just says -- about the team, everyone is going to do whatever it takes to win. And even though he wasn't a hundred percent, he said he wanted to play, and he knew he could give us something. And I thought that the minutes he gave us were valuable. It speaks to who he is, and it speaks to the locker room.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, those were actual numbers. We live in an expected world. So we didn't pay much attention to the actual numbers.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,But to me it was just paying attention more to the process of what we were doing. And there were obviously some things that we had to improve upon from last year analytically to make up for some of the stuff that we lost. The guys bought into that.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So to me, it was just more of the process of making sure that we are playing the right way, making sure, you know, we are attacking the game analytically in the right way, but also having the open-mindedness and discipline to do some of the other stuff.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought it was a good balance.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like it's going to be like that for the rest of my career, as it should be. I think just having an understanding that praise and criticism are both just as dangerous. And if you don't handle them well, and I think we talked about that as a team this year, like winning is just as dangerous as losing if you don't handle it well.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think our guys handled winning the right way by, whether we won or lost, we just moved on to the next game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"And it's Boston. Like, we wouldn't want it any other way. I think the ownership and the responsibility to give back to the franchise, give back to the city, that's just part of it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so I think -- but you need it. Like, you need that. You need criticism. You need praise. You need expectations. All those things go into making who you are as a person, making who you are as people, as an organization.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So just having an understanding that they are never going to go away. If someone tells you ""Good job,"" that's just as dangerous as someone telling you you suck. But you need both of them in order to get to where you want to get to, and there's no place else I'd rather be.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,They shoot the ball a lot. I mean they are good. They are really good. That number is incredible when you think about it.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,But it works. And so we're going to need to add to that point total tonight if we want to win.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's a balance. You know, there's communication. There's always development with one's individual game. And so it's almost going to be a year since we had him in the draft. I think the draft is in nine or 10 days.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"And so to be able to see where he has improved, not just in his strength but also the other areas, and he can shoot. You know, he has the ability. He has a nice stroke out beyond the arc. And so in due time, he will be one that's going to probably shoot a lot of threes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But right now, his strength is offensive rebounding, the vertical game, and then defense, being able to guard the ball and then also protect the rim.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, those have been games that we've looked at as games that can change a series. And so just understanding swing games, when you look at 3 and 5, are typically the swing games. So we really have had success in Game 5s, and hopefully that will continue tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we expected him back at some point, and he's available tonight. What does it change? Just, you know, his ability to score in Game 1 and 2, and we have to be better. We've got to make him put it on the floor where he just can't catch-and-shoot.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Then defensively, we have to be aware of his shot blocking. And so we've got to account for him when we do drive it to the paint that he's one that can change or block shots, and we have to be better at that. In Game 1 and 2, we weren't very good.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"With him on the floor, we'll see how he moves, but I think that healthy or not healthy -- I mean, healthy, we are going to still check to see how he moves. So nothing changes there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we're going to fight. We put ourselves in a position in Game 4 to get a win to keep the series going, and now we're here in Boston. They have played extremely well at home. But we still feel that the pressure is on them to end the series.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"For us, it's to go out there and play. Hopefully we can copy some of the things we did in Game 4 to have success and hopefully can put ourselves in a position tonight to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But, you know, as we've always said in this league, it's hard to close the door. Nothing's given. You've got to earn it. And so for tonight, we've got to find a way to keep this thing going and get it back to Dallas.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"He's a superstar. He's one of the best players in the world. Most stars love that type of atmosphere, that type of setting. That's what makes them stars is they tend to bring their best game with their back against the wall. He's done it for the Mavs and for his national team, and so we expect nothing any less than that tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I knew about the Red Sox and Yankees. You know, when you talk about being down 3-0, that's the truth and those are the facts.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But there is another game to be played, and so if you can just stay in the present, that can help, you know, with what you're trying to achieve, and that's to keep the series going, and we did that in Game 4.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Here on the road, we have to be in the present. We can't think about Game 6 or Game 4. We have to play Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"So we are excited about having this opportunity, and hopefully we can put our best foot forward to keep this thing going.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their journey for seven years, there's been ups, there's been learning experiences for them with winning and losing, and so understanding for us, we've been together for five months, some of us, so this is a really positive journey that we've been on here, and we'll look at what we can do as we get to the Finals, just understanding we have to play our best basketball. Unfortunately, Boston was better than us in this series and they won the championship.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the first step is just to be in it. I think that's a big thing. A lot of us -- when I say a lot of us, excluding the people in the locker room, didn't have us here, and so to be able to start the playoffs in L.A., to start the playoffs in Oklahoma, to start the playoffs in Minnesota, to understand that that's not easy to do. I thought the group did a great job. Yes, we lost 4-1, but I thought the group fought against the Celtics and just, unfortunately, we just couldn't make shots when we had to, or we turned the ball over and they took full advantage of that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"So there's a lot of positives in this run that we were on during the playoffs, but also, since March, we've been playing basketball at a high level. So when we go back to look at some of the stuff, what we can continue to build on and what we can get better at.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a very good point. First year we lose to Golden State, who becomes the world champs, then we lose this year to the World Champs in the Boston Celtics. So, not a bad run in two out of three years. So, in between those two years, we get D-Live and we get trades that makes the team better, so a lot of positive things.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"We're a young team, and so this isn't a team when you look at, you know, do we have to replace some of the older players, it's -- you know, we have a core, a young core at that, and so this is an exciting time to be a Mavs fan and to also be a coach for the Mavs.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Well, he's one of the best players in the world, and so I think the biggest thing for him is that we all would like to be healthy, but there's going to be bumps and bruises along the way. So, for him at the age of 25 to get to the Finals, to be playing his basketball at the level that he's playing is, now it's just being consistent, and I think we all would say he led the league in scoring.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"He also has won, so now it's just a matter of being consistent and, again, always being in the talk for MVP because when you have one of the best players in the world, you should be always fighting for a championship.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's just time, being able to go through it, to get to know each other a little bit better on the court and off the court. So, I think the more time that these guys are around each other the better they're going to be next year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Again, five months without a training camp. This season started in Abu Dhabi and it's been going on for a long time. So for this group to spend time together, to fail, and to understand what it feels like to fail and also to see what failure is and then how do we get better and learn from that. I think I've got a great group of young men who will be hungry this summer and will come back ready to play at a high level.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it snowballed quickly. The turnovers led to easy baskets or wide-open threes. So they took advantage of that, and we couldn't keep scoring or keep pace with them. We got good looks that just didn't go down for us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Very confident. I mean, that's a positive note that we can take from this series, just how far we made it and how proud I am of the guys. We answered a lot of questions this year on what we were capable of doing and now it's just about being consistent. I think probably in the last week, I said that I wanted to be remembered as one of the best teams of this era and our last few champions have been a new one each and every year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So, I see an opportunity for us to really build our future in a positive manner where this is almost like a regular thing for us, and we're competing for championships. You know, I think from a spiritual standpoint, I think I enjoyed this journey more than any other season, just because of the redemption arc and being able to learn as much as I did about myself and my teammates and the organization and the people that I'm around. It's a lot of good people here so it makes coming to work a lot of fun.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, it starts in the summertime, it starts early in preseason when you're developing your habits. I think we went 0-4 in preseason to start, which wasn't the best start. But we got off to a pretty decent start to the season and there was some injuries and some uncontrollable things that happened, but I think if you look at the overall big picture, Luka's right, and I've been saying it too, just failure, it can inspire you beyond measure.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"We started off as a fifth seed and started on the road in every series and we were able to accomplish this and we were able to grow as teammates and a brotherhood here, a sisterhood here, where we can really take that as a positive going into the summer. So, yeah, failing at this stage definitely sucks. It's a bitter feeling because you want to keep playing and you feel like your best game is coming up next and the shots that you shoot next game are coming up, and now we got to wait two and a half months, three and a half months so the new champion gets a chance.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So, yeah, I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to grow with these guys in this locker room. Everybody across our organization, we've been able to celebrate our wins, but also learn how to celebrate our losses too and how to grow from that. So that's the difficult part of being human. When you really love something you really want to win and it doesn't happen, how do you respond from that. So I think that's where we are now, but I think I could tell you I'm pretty confident that we'll be back in the gym pretty soon and getting ready for next year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it was emotional anyway. I mean, every series was emotional, just because I was just uncertain on how it was going to go and how we were going to respond to a little bit of adversity. We finally ran into a team where they beat us fair and square, and we weren't able to respond to a lot of their runs and we weren't able to execute at a high level. So when I was shaking everybody's hands, that was more of a sign of respect for their journey. They have been through an incredible five-year span of going to Game 7s or losing in the Finals, so they know what this bitter feeling feels like being up here answer answering questions about when this next year holds and I think they used everything as motivation.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"They were healthy, and they really kept their head down and weren't paying attention to any of the personal accolades or individual accolades. I think they just came together as a team and were okay with each person being great in their role and selflessly putting their best foot forward. So I think we learned more than anything from this series on what it takes to not only get back to this level, but win at this level, and the Celtics are the perfect example for us this season because of how much they have had to deal with in the past few years.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So, it's admirable, you know, and to see -- did JB win Finals MVP? Yeah, that was big-time to see that trophy in his hands. I think him and JT should have split it, but those two guys in particular have, you know, almost been like students and as well now becoming teachers in their own right. So to see them accomplish -- see them accomplish that, I'm really proud and also extremely motivated to get back to this position in the next few years with my guys and be able to win this thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, basketball is a game of centimeters, man, sometimes inches, so when a ball is flying off your hands, sometimes it's going to feel good, sometimes it isn't. That's the maturity aspect. You got to move on to the next thing, and I've been talking about that. Whether I'm playing well specifically scoring-wise or I'm not, there is a team aspect here that we're becoming more gelled into or dialed into.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I can score 25 points, but if I don't, we got to be able to pick each other up, and I think that's what we're learning about each other now, where they're going to be games where the shooting is not going to go well particularly for me or someone else on the team, and that's where we have to galvanize as a group and other players make plays and opportunities created for one another. I've been at the point of attack through most of my drives going against the Celtics one-on-one or coming off screens.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So that's what the summer is for, is just continuing to work on those things that I saw this year, the physicality, being able to adjust to it and by next year be in a better position.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would agree with that. Yeah, just time together means a lot, and failing together is not the ideal situation, but from a leadership standpoint, going through situations like that sometimes it will motivate you beyond things that you could imagine. When I was a little bit younger and I was injured in 2015 and we lost, it was a team loss. It wasn't just I was injured and we could have done this or that. So that went on my Finals record. I was 0-1. The next year we came back and won in a 3-1 comeback, and then the following year we lost against the Warriors and I haven't been back since.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So, I look at it as, you know, an opportunity for us to observe what we did well this year as a group and how me and Luka can be better as the leaders of the team, one of -- a few of the leaders on the team, and really just enjoy the ups and downs of what's coming because now we know what to expect.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So, this past year was a lot of newness. It was a lot of people being in new positions in terms of just the success. Success can be new for a lot of people too, but when you fail at the Finals, it's not something that you want to carry the disappointment forever or on to next season. We worked extremely hard to be one of the final two teams. We didn't achieve our goal, but we achieved most of our goal. So, this is just the last step that we have to get back to, and we know it's not going to be easy. We're going to be going against a lot of young teams that are emerging, but we're going to get better as well, and I think this experience will carry us forth in the following series that we play next year. God willing we make it back to the playoffs and get the chance to play our best basketball.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it's easy to get to that point when you have no other choice but to look at your partner or your teammates and say that we're going to do this and we're going to accomplish it, no matter what anyone says.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"The hardest thing, I would say one of the most difficult things, not the hardest thing, but one of the most difficult things in this industry is, as I've been here for 12 years, is dealing with a lot of the relationship with, sort of say, social media or fans and media, and then us as players and wanting to achieve a golden legacy, so to say. Everybody looks at MJ as the prototypical guy, he was 6-0. Then you go down the list to Bill Russell and other great guys that have come through this league -- I could name a myriad of names, but for those guys in particular I think they have had the same trajectory or career path as some of the greatest to play the game, where they have lost early in their career and now they're at the top of the mountain because they earned their way there and they have been able to learn. So, again, I'm nothing short of proud of those guys, but I think this was a message to my teammates as well, that when we get this opportunity, God willing we get this opportunity again, we work hard, it's going to be more than just our talent that's going to get us over that edge. It's going to be more than just somebody scoring 30. It's going to take more than just scoring, it's going to take everything from you. That's what makes this thing beautiful too is, when you get to the top of that mountain, how do you stay motivated there. Now that they're there I think those are questions they're going to have to answer for themselves. But for us, we got to the top of the mountain and we failed, so now we have to start at the bottom, and that should be inspiring. So, grateful that I love what I do, grateful that I get to do it with people that love what they do too. So it will be a long summer, but looking forward to the start of next season now.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I'm so grateful. I know I've said it before, but it's glory to the Lord for putting me in this position. It's been a lot of years.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Wow. It was crazy because during free agency meetings in 2016, my agent and I, Jason Glushon, were both sitting in the meeting, and we just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wycs hand. And after the meeting we were like, Did you notice that? That's the attention.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Man, I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, ""You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic.""",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"The fact that it has come, it has happened, JT, JB, stepping up in a big way and leading us, it's special.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, no question. You know, we all know Joe was thrown into the fire last year, and I felt like he did the best he could.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"But I just think this year, everything was different when we came in for workouts before training camp. He really, I felt like, put a sprint on everything how he wanted it to be and how he wanted us to work, how he wanted us to carry ourselves and how determined he wanted us to be.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"And it started from there. That energy that he had translated to the assistant coaches, to us, to the training staff, everybody, and we just kind of follow suit.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I feel like this type of team is Joe Mazzulla ball. It's defending, being gritty on offense. It's being able to -- everybody be a threat on the court at the same time.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"And everything that he wanted to do, he was able to accomplish. He always knew when to push the buttons. He's hard. He can be a little whacky sometimes. But that's what we appreciate about him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"He truly cares about us, and he cares about what it means to be a Celtic.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, the first thing you have to do when you come here is you have to embrace that pressure. And I was okay with being in that position. I was okay if we were getting criticized and we weren't getting it done because I understood what it means playing here. And to your point, finally overcoming that and winning and putting ourselves with the greats, this is special.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Our group, we've had a lot of hardships the last few years. Last year, heartbreaker against Miami, Game 7. Year before, Golden State. It's been building up.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"But this team has been resilient, and we've continued to work. I'm so proud of Jaylen, and I'm so proud of Jayson. Those two guys continue to take steps forward. People all year criticizing them, all that expectation, all the pressure.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,They did it. And they've done it at a young age. They led our group. I'm just very proud of those guys and to put everything aside and focus on winning.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Man, that was beautiful. That was beautiful. He did that, and you take a glance at the other team, and it's one of those that breaks your spirit, and then it just kind of fueled us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"But Payton, man, that just sums it up. It was ups and downs for him, not knowing what to expect, when to play, when not to play. He's the kind of guy that he is a big-time player, and it's hard because we have a lot of guys.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"But man, him stepping up, cold, ready, not afraid of the moment, taking the shot and man, as soon as he shot it, like I don't know how you guys saw it, but I was like, man, he's about to knock it down. Like this is crazy.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,AL HORFORD,"So, man, the fact that he knocked it down, like that was huge. That was special.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I feel like it was impressive. I feel like what people expected us to do or doubted us to do, we did. So shout out to this team and this organization. We did it together, and that was the only way that we could do it was together.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, that we did it together. I hope that when people watch us play, they see the joy that we play with, that we love playing together, and we got it done together. I feel like that's the most important thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. It doesn't. Winning's always great. When you do it with people that you love to do it with, it feels great. When you see your teammates celebrating and jumping on each other and throwing champagne, there's nothing like it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's been a journey, you know. I think just being able to, I don't know, maybe reflect on it right now, it's crazy. It seemed like it was yesterday, sitting there with Wyc and him introducing me and just kind of handing me the jersey and everything.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"And then fast-forward to now, it's like insane. But I'm blessed to be here, and I'm so happy to be here and I'm so happy Brad gave me that call to come through, and JT texting me, hitting me up, talking about ""Come on, Champ."" It's been a hell of a journey.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I think I've spoken on this plenty of times, but they get scrutinized so much and they get so much pressure put on them for not winning or making it to the Eastern Conference Finals eight years in a row, or even making it to the Finals and not getting over that hump.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But I feel like people finally see the relationship that they have. They see that from the beginning, they have always done it together. They have never compared against each other. They have always been joyful and happy for each other.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"So it's been great to experience on this side, and to be on this side and get this win, hopefully it's a burden off of their shoulders. But another burden is doing it again.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"He's done a great job. He's definitely elevated my game. Had me look kind of outside of myself and bring something different, you know.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"On previous teams where maybe I had to score more or handle the ball more, here it was more about being available and knocking down corner threes and rebounding. Doing things that help this team because of the talent that we have.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You know, he really opened my eyes to that and from the beginning really just made it known that whatever it takes, as long as it takes, we've got to get it done, and I'm not the only one on this team sacrificing. Everybody on this team sacrificed something.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they just -- they came out aggressive, man. They were good defensively. They're a great defensive team. Respect to them and respect to the coaches for their defensive scheme.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, it's been a hell of a year. I love these guys, man. Like, I mean, we put this team -- you know, with trades and everything was five months ago and to see the growth as a team, and it's different. You know, like -- I don't know. There's a lot of international guys and we don't always have family around and to be able to build a bond like this and to call the team family, it's awesome. To be able to do that in such a short amount of time is -- it's amazing. So obviously, we didn't get what we wanted, but I'm proud and everyone else is very proud of the team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, it's fun when everything -- yeah. 1 through 15, man, like I couldn't -- like, best teammates. They're all great guys in all their individual ways. So, I mean, yeah, by far, man, it always makes your job a lot better when you have fun every day and to call those guys my teammates, for sure.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"We got here and I think everyone's hungry now. Obviously, we didn't get where we wanted to, but it's not the end of the world. We know that we need to regroup and be back here again next year. That's the goal every single year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, Kyrie does a great job and he's done a great job from the moment he's got here of being a leader and being someone for younger guys, but also for everyone on the team. So, I mean, obviously it is what it is. The crowds can chant whatever they want to chant. When we're away, they're obviously going to go against us. He does a great job of not letting it affect him and I think that goes back to his leadership on and off the court.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"So we have nothing but respect for Kyrie and we're not expecting the Celtics to be with us. We're opposing them. So whatever they say is whatever they say. But we all got his back, for sure.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Just maybe just physicality, coming out a little stronger or whatnot. But, I don't know, I really haven't thought about it too much. I don't know. My head's all over the place right now.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I don't know. I just wanted to leave it all on the floor tonight. I try to play every game like it's my last. But, I mean, individual, like it doesn't really matter at this stage. I really just want to win. Yeah, I don't know. We just didn't win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,Nothing. Sad we lost. No specific.,,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I feel great. We did some great moves. I would say we've been together for five months. I'm proud of every guy that stepped on the floor, all the coaches, all the people behind. Obviously, we didn't win Finals, but we did have a hell of a season and I'm proud of every one of them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,They were physical a lot. They have great defenders.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,Just everything. They're a great team. That's what they do.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't want to talk about what's next, man. I have some decisions to make. I'm just trying to get a little bit healthier. We'll talk -- we have interviews in two days, right? So I'll give you an answer then.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Right now, I don't really know. That's not what I'm thinking. But they're a great team. They have been together for a long time, and they had to go through everything, so we just got to look at them, see how they play, maturity, and they have some great players. We can learn from that. We got to fight next season.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Just stay together, man. I think just having Ky on my team -- I mean, on our team, he's unbelievable. Just help him. We said, We'll fight together next season, and we just going to believe.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"To be honest, I can't even put it into words. Just Bill Russell and what he's meant for me through my Boston journey, and his spirit. You know, everything that he stood for, just for this to be the Bill Russell MVP Award, it just -- I've got nothing, man. I don't even know what to say. It's unreal.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we learned. I think we learned from all of our mistakes. All of our adversity has made us stronger, made us tougher. All season you could see it. We started from the jump. We made all the sacrifices. We played both ends of the ball at a high level. We didn't skip any steps. And this was the result.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"And it makes it feel even that much better that we had to go through all the journey, the heartbreak, the embarrassment, the loss, to get to the mountaintop.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,It's great. And shout out to all the supporters and the city of Boston.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't even put into words the emotions. It's just I'm blessed and I'm grateful. This was a full team effort. We had a great team. My teammates were great. They allowed me to lead us on both ends of ball, and we just came out and performed on our home floor. It's just amazing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"You know, it could have gone to anybody. It could have gone to Jayson. Jayson, like I can't talk enough about his selflessness. You know, I can't talk enough about his attitude. It's just how he approached not just this series or the Finals but just the playoffs in general. And we did it together as a team, and that was the most important thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just our growth together. We've been through a lot. We've been playing together for seven years now. We've been through a lot, the losses, the expectations. The media have said all different types of things We can't play together, we are never going to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"We heard it all. But we just blocked it out, and we just kept going. I trusted him. He trusted me. And we did it together.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"To get to this point and share that experience with JT is just awesome, you know what I mean? It's amazing, and it feels great.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"If you would have asked me that maybe a year ago, I would probably say yeah. But just at the point I got to right now, it feels great. But any of the personal awards, it is what it is.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, the doubters, they may be quiet now, but they will be back. They will be back next year with something to say. I'll embrace that moment the same and get after it yet again.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,Golden Bears.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't. I can't. I absolutely can't, man. Just the story and the journey is awesome. You know, just being drafted here in Boston, like a lot of the people probably didn't watch me play in the Pac-12 at Cal. You know, it led to a lot of people feeling a way about that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"And, you know, I just came in and kept my head down and told myself, I'm going to just keep working. And, you know, to be here in this moment now, through all the years, through all the doubt, through all of the ups and downs, through all of the verdicts, through all of the everything, it just makes the story that much sweeter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"But I can't even put it into words. Like, it just feels great.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, nobody deserved it more than Al. He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Like just his performance all season long, like Al is 37, 38 years old, and we leaned on him so much. Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains, you know what I mean. The only thing he does is add to winning.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"For him, great teammate. It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we have an opportunity. I think we definitely have a window. We take it one day at a time. We definitely have to make sure we stay healthy. But, you know, we'll enjoy the summer, enjoy the moment, and then we get right back to it next year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, it still kind of feels unreal. It feels like there's another game or something tomorrow. But, you know, I can't tell you enough about our group and our coaching staff. They were great all season long. They prepared us for these moments.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"We had an excellent game plan in the Finals, and then all of the guys contributed. Like, for example, like Payton Pritchard, like unreal, right. Unreal. Like just comes in the game and drains one from halfcourt. That dude, he's a f---ing legend, man. Shout out to Payton Pritchard.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"It means a lot. I wish my grandmother was here with me to see this moment.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,But I wish she could be here. But she was so important and pivotal in my life. And it's just awesome. I know she would be proud of me.,,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Try to move on. I mean, that's what the playoffs is all about, win or loss, you've got to move on from it. You've got to learn from it. You understand that you've got to play better than obviously Game 4. Every game gets more difficult, so we just have to be locked into our game plan.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"We've been lucky enough to have a lot of the past champions here, and just seeing their presence. I just think that when it gets tough, and obviously it's going to get tough. We've just got to stick together. We've got to believe in one another, and we've been doing that all year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"For us? I would say we're a confident group. I just think you've got to stick together. There's going to be ups, and there's going to be downs. And, I mean, if someone is struggling or whatever, you have to pick them up, and that's the type of team we have.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Obviously you just look at the rebounding numbers, that tells you a lot about what happened in that game. Just get back to five guys crashing the paint and just trying to get every rebound.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't look at it as pressure. I do notice, especially this time of the season, playoff time and obviously being in the Finals for the second time. When you drive around and go to the gas station, or I wanted to go get some ice cream yesterday, it's Celtics gear everywhere and everybody is super excited about this team and what we have accomplished and what we have the chance to accomplish.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"You really just feel the love and support from everybody in the city of Boston, and how bad they want us to win, how much they have been cheering for us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So I don't look at it as pressure. Just unconditional support, and that we have an amazing fan base here.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"It did take some time. For one, normally, when you're a top five draft pick, you go to a lottery team that is rebuilding. I was in a unique situation from the rest of the guys in my draft class in that the Celtics were the No. 1 seed in the East before. We were competing for a championship ever since I've gotten here.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I would say just throughout that season. I had no idea who Cedric Maxwell was. I thought he was just like a radio guy laughter. I didn't know that he played on the team, and he won Finals MVP.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,So there were just different instances throughout the season in my rookie year where I would learn about different people that played an intricate part in this organization -- the history throughout the Celtics and what the Celtics mean to the game of basketball. You just grow a level of appreciation through your time here.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. When I found out that I was going to be a dad, I was still in college. I had like a week or two left. I wasn't ecstatic. I was a little selfish at that point because I knew that I was about to go chase my dream and be in the NBA. I felt like that was going to affect what people thought of me, affect where I went in the draft.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So I'd be the first to say I wasn't like super thrilled to find out I was going to be a dad, and quickly realized that it was like the best thing that ever could have happened to me. There's nothing better than being a dad.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I think, especially for me and my first year in the NBA at 19, it taught me a sense of responsibility. Because it's tough, being 19 years old and coming into fame and this newfound fortune. Nobody can, I guess, help you or prepare you for what it's like to be 19 and have millions of dollars.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"And I think -- not that I think. I know that having Deuce at that age grounded me. Because whatever decision I wanted to make, I had to make sure that he was taken care of. I couldn't just up and go or do everything that some of my peers were doing because I had to go home and put him to bed. Or for Father's Day weekend I was going out of town or -- I had to skip out on this trip with my friends because it was my weekend with him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Not that it's a sacrifice. I willingly would choose those things. But it has taught me a sense of responsibility, as well as just making the right decisions. Knowing that there's a six-year-old mini me essentially watching everything that I do and knowing that I have to be the best version of myself. I have to make the right decisions because he's always watching.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think after Game 4, he just reminded us to have fun. We wanted to go for the kill, essentially, and we wanted to win so bad that maybe we got away from what makes us special and what makes us the Boston Celtics.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Today, just reminded each guy why he's important to this team and why we all need each other and what a person brings to the table. I think that was really important for us to go over today.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,I don't think we came out and expected that we were going to come out and roll over on it and win. I firmly believe we had the right intentions. We wanted to win. We wanted to play the right way. That moment -- we wanted that moment.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,But I think we maybe put too much pressure on ourselves at that moment to be perfect or think it was going to go how we wanted it to go.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,Joe did a great job today of reminding us that it's okay to smile during wars. It's okay to have fun during high-pressure moments. That's what makes our team unique and special.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"We would love to win tomorrow, more than anything. But if it doesn't happen, it's not the end of the world. We have more opportunities. So just setting that table of don't surrender to that idea that we have to win tomorrow. We would love to, absolutely. But Game 5 is the biggest game of the season because it's the next game on the schedule.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So going with that mindset, and just have fun. That's really what we talked about today. Get back to having fun and being a team and how special we are and the team that got us here.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Very excited. We're excited to come out here and compete and try to get this W.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"We came back Saturday morning. It was a nice flight. We already moved on from it. There's no reason to dwell on it. Get ready for Game 5 and try to get the W. The flight was good. We got together as a team, enjoyed it and get ready.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It would be huge to win this next game. We really want to win the next game. But if we don't, it's not the end of the world. We have three more rounds to go, at most. But the most important game is the next one, and to do it in front of the home crowd would be special.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I'm expecting it to be rowdy. Definitely a crazy, crazy atmosphere. Looking forward to it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just shows that teams are capable of coming back from that. If you get hot, you can win four games in a row. So understanding that, and knowing that every game we've got to bring everything we've got. It's going to take 48 minutes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player. He's somebody we care for deeply and gives us a great boost. Him as a person, just being there is huge for us. We are lucky to have him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He definitely wants to play. He's a really big competitor, and I know he's going to do everything in his power to get out there and put on that uniform with his teammates.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They just beat us in every category possible 5050 balls, rebounding, shooting, defensively. It's like one of those games, you just scrap and look forward to the next one because they beat us fair and square.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"That will never happen if you don't run back on defense, rebound, execute and get to your spacing. That's the most important thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,I haven't talked to him yet. Going to talk about that before we start at 200. So I'm not sure kind of where he's at. But he's trying and doing everything he can to try to put himself in position to be out there. I know that for sure.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"You're just made by all the experiences and things that you have. Regardless of what I am, what I'm made from, first and foremost, my identity, Christ is the most important thing before all that. And after that, it's about winning for the Boston Celtics and the process of winning -- getting back on defense, playing hard, transition, rebounding, spacing, execution. Those things are the most important.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's a good question. Multiple layers to that. Obviously it's game plan, execution, and that can change once the game begins. One side of the ball is heavily dictated by the other.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think one of the things that we've freed our minds to this year is just making reads and having an understanding, having a spatial awareness about who is where, what's the spacing, what's the attack and just being able to make plays on both ends of the floor there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So there's definitely obviously a game plan component. You have to have a plan going into it. But at the end of the day, it's the individual pride, and then it's the instincts from the guy when they are out there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, every game, regardless of how it goes, there's always stuff that you can learn from and there's always stuff that you don't learn from. Regardless, I think the most important thing is our process toward getting better has been the same whether we have won or lost, whether we have won big or lost big.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"We have always tried to find the 10 or 12 possessions we can get better at and find the things we did pretty well and how can we do those more. I just kept a consistent process toward our postgame retrieval, and then how we grow with that heading into the next game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"When they are at their best, the team that dictates the pace dictates kind of the momentum and the opportunities. So yeah, I think that's definitely part of it, is how can we dictate the pace of the game and how can we dictate the momentum of the game. You can do that in different ways. Transition is obviously one of those, but there's other ways you can do that as well.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Just have to be open-minded. Every game takes on a life of its own. We have the things that we can control and then we have the things that we have to be ready to adjust to kind of depending upon how the game goes over the course of time.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just a guy defined by the ability to make plays on both ends. Like you said, mistakes don't weigh him down. Doesn't matter if he misses a shot or makes a mistake on the defensive end. Just has the ability to make plays and he can do them on both ends of the floor. That balance of impacting the game in different ways is crucial for us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Thank you.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, definitely. I think some of our defensive struggles came from our offensive struggles, no question, and vice versa. There's definitely some things we need to do better on the offensive end.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We just take it as -- being together, in film and just understanding the flow of the game. But even before the game, Coach Kidd said, I hope you packed your bags because we are going to Boston.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just having that mentality of doing whatever it takes. We've definitely been changing our ID from playing free to playing desperate. Doing whatever we can to get a bucket or get a stop. That energy, that focus is going to propel us into transition buckets, transition steals and trying to get into the game that we play.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We definitely need to help them. They have a lot of weight on their shoulders. They're controlling the ball the majority of the time. They have the majority of the points. No matter if it's the offensive or defense side, we're backing them up.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"They can have their foot on the gas as much as possible knowing that if they have to take their foot off the gas a little bit, we're going to pick it back up. There are going to be times when they get tired or they're not going to bring the ball up the floor. That's where we are their backup as role players, as people on the bench doing what we need to do to take a little weight off their back.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We were playing like how we play. We were running and talking and playing free. We were just trusting one another. We were getting back into the mentality of trusting the pass, trusting the next pass and, on the defensive side, just trusting the person behind you, trusting the person who is talking.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Definitely can. We're not going to say that Game 4 was our best game. Game 4 was a good game, but we're not hanging our hats on it. We adjusted, and now it's just taking what we did in Game 4 and adding a little bit more aggression into Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,I wouldn't say it's a new series. Everyone just counted us out after the first three.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,We are not going to count ourselves out. We are going to double down and put ten toes down and make sure that we are giving it our all on the court. Put our heart and soul on the floor and do whatever it takes to win.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's going to be loud and nasty. You do your best not to focus on the crowd. There's going to be a lot of people talking to you. Social media, walking down the street, you're in the hotel room, you're in the hotel, you're going to hear people talking to you, you're going to hear people talking to you coming to the arena. It's part of the game. Part of the job. You have to deal with adversity and people always telling you you can't, and you've got to do it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"That specifically wasn't the conversations, but the vibe was always good because we won, right. I think we also showed that that's how we've got to play and how we should play the game. That was more so the reason.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"As a team, when you play professional sports, you never quit. You always fight. You always play. You always compete, and I think we showed that the last game. We had that energy, like a little bit desperation.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,We have to treat every game like that. There's no relaxing. We've got to play our best because obviously we're playing against the best. But we are going to stay together and compete until the last game. So that has to be the mindset no matter what.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"There's always been history in sports, in different sports. So I think as an athlete, you should always believe and always keep fighting.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Well, we have our schemes and we have a certain way that we play. I think it's more so understanding what we want to be and how we want to create certain mismatches and certain drive-and-shot opportunities. It's not so much changing our playing style right now. We've got to keep playing the basketball that we played all season long that got us here.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"We've just got to make sure that we create the spot and the spacing for Kyrie and Luka. The first three games, we didn't do it as much. So they had to take all the shots and they had to settle for different shots.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Game 4, we played with a different pace. We got it up quick. That creates mismatches and better opportunities for us, and also creates an open floor, for example, and Derrick Jones, attacking and stuff like that. It's more about finding the right spacing, but there's no time to change our style right now.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Whatever it takes. That's the mindset, it's not going to be perfect, especially against a team like that. There had to be adjustments obviously because they play different than other teams. But I think we have great guys, smart guys, high-IQ guys that can adapt to changes, that's what we showed.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Last game, overall, still the energy was the key factor. And one of the guys who got us going early, for example, Dereck Lively, just like having that energy and alertness helps us to be on the same page, communicate better and have the right rotations down.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"And that's what we've got to keep doing. Challenge every shot, they are a great shooting team, so you can't have moments where you mess up multiple offensive or defensive plays because they are just going to go on a run. For us, the energy kept us being alert and helped us adjust to the defensive rotations, too.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought they were really good in Game 4. That helped us get to Game 5. But just understand, we can't have three on the ball. They are too good at being able to make that pass. They are the best team at shooting the three. There are some things that we can clean up, and we're going to have to be better here in Game 5 if we want to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I think what helps is we were in that situation last game. So not to change or deviate from what we talked about in Game 4. It's just take each possession one possession at a time, and hopefully we can put ourselves up winning each quarter. We ended up doing that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Same thing that we are talking about today and tomorrow is we can only focus on Game 5, and trying to find a way to win here in Boston.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, one, it's hard to win in the Finals. And so I think, as you brought up, each game, we have gotten better on both ends, offensively and defensively. So the trend is to continue to get better. Hopefully we can do that in Game 5, where we can get better defensively and offensively. We started to knock down shots here in Game 4, and hopefully we can get those same shots in Game 5 and have the opportunity to knock them down.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But looking at Luka and Ky, those two have to set the tone for us and everybody else will follow.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I think, and I'm not speaking for him, but just from experience, just as an athlete, you want to get another opportunity, and he has that opportunity here tomorrow night. Hopefully he can take full advantage of that. Make some adjustments and look back at Game 1 and 2 and see what they were doing to him defensively and hopefully take advantage in Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Our defense didn't really change. I think just the effort. I think Luka participated at a high level, and he was really good on the ball. He came up with some deflections and steals. We believe that he is going to be involved in the pick-and-roll tomorrow.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"We're going to need that same effort from him, but also for the guys that are there to help protect him, they will be ready to protect him. But he's got to participate at a high level, and we believe he will.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he looked like he joined a special company. He looked like Ray and Steph. So we're going to need that here in Game 5. If it's a close game, hopefully he is able to knock down those same shots, get those same shots.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But it was great to see Timmy knock down those shots. Hopefully he can build on that, and as a team we can build on that. We are going to need that here in Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,They are not a team that changes. They are a team that makes you change.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"So they are going to probably look to see that they had some good looks from three that didn't go down, and also being able to probably get Tatum and Brown going early. Having those two attack our defense early is probably something that could be an adjustment.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But for them, it's shooting the three, creating in the three and then capitalizing on your mistakes. Hopefully for us, our mistakes were low in Game 4, and hopefully they are low in Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's probably something to that. If we look at the analytics of our group, they are young, and as the series goes on, they get better. Hopefully that's true tomorrow night.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Sometimes when you do play an opponent over and over, you get used to the tendencies and you start to capitalize on that on both ends, defensively and offensively. Hopefully our group has seen enough of Boston to understand what they are good at, and hopefully we can take that away tomorrow night.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I don't want you to mistake us smiling and joking around with each other and being in practice, you know, for a weakness or that we are not taking this any more serious than we were in Game 4. I just think we are here in Boston and just trying to settle ourselves.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"We had a meeting, just as a squad, at the hotel, where we went over film. So we were pretty locked in from there, and there was carryover into our early minutes in practice. And then when you guys come in, pretty much having fun.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It's been this way since we were kids. We want to make sure we relish in this moment, don't take it for granted and just ground ourselves here, too. I think the last two games, we were even more intense when we were here in Boston. Don't think we got as settled as we would have liked.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So we just wanted to try some things a little different, a little bit more smiling. And then 24 hours from now, getting ready for all-out battle against this great Celtics team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Well, to answer your first part of your question, I would be being dishonest if I just took the time to say thank you for putting those words together in terms of my interactions with people being majority of the time positive.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I'll be honest with you, it's not always positive all the time. I'm human. Sometimes there's some misunderstanding or miscommunications and it takes a little bit of a longer, thorough conversations just to get on the same page. I think I've just figured out in my life, a lot of people just want the time and space to be heard. They want to be listened to. And then if they respect you and you respect them, then they'll listen to you and give you the space to say how you feel as well.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I've talked about it over the past few months, just where I was in 2017 or '18, when I first got traded here to Boston. I wasn't in the place to be able to vocalize my feelings or know how to do that. I was learning how to be a man. Learning how to be a father. So part of that evolution came from that, taking the time to go inside and figure out who I wanted to become.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But also, I had to accept some of the things, some of the choices I had done in my life. When you look at yourself in the mirror, sometimes you don't like what you see, and that could lead to some depression or lead to some anxiety or lead to other mental health issues.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"That's a big thing that I think our generation is spearheading, where I hope that the older generation can take a lesson out of our book, that this isn't just some spiritual '70s type of mantras we are trying to put out here. We actually believe in what we talk about in terms of meditation and having the ability to slow your life down and making sure that you keep your priorities straight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,Because the world is not going to care about how you feel mentally all the time or whether or not you are healthy when you are at home or taking care of yourself. So you have to figure out that space for yourself and figure out the village and the tribe that you want to have around you that supports those goals that you have personally.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't want to get too preachy, preachy. I could speak for hours. But, yeah, that's been the growth since 2017. Even before then. Just learning how to be a person in this world, making an impact in a positive way.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"When I look back, getting traded here, it wasn't one of my options. It wasn't like No. 1 on my list. So when the trade opportunity got approached to me, instead of going back and appreciating the Celtics' history, I just came in with an open mind and just kind of like, all right, I'm just going to go with the flow into this. But I think that was the wrong approach. Just being young.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Now being older with hindsight looking back, I definitely would have taken time to know the people in the community and talked to some of the champions that have come before me and actually extend myself to them instead of the other way around, expecting them to be there giving me advice. Because they have been through this. They have championship pedigree here. They have shown it for years. They are one of the most winningest franchises in all of sports.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So you have to show your respect here. I think that's what I struggled with initially, was figuring out how I'm going to be a great player here while winning championships and also leading a team and selflessly joining the Celtics' organization or the cult that they have here.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what they expect you to do as a player. They expect you to seamlessly buy into the Celtics' pride, buy into everything Celtics. And if you don't, then you'll be outed.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm one of the people that's on the outs laughing. I'm perfectly fine with that, you know what I mean. I did it to myself. They don't welcome me with a warm embrace, even though I know a lot of people in the organization and I'm friends still with some of them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But, yeah, doing it to myself. And that's what I was talking about in terms of accepting the choices. But looking back, I would have shown my respect and have more of a council around me from some of the Boston Celtics that came before me to explain what the pressure is like.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"You just expect to have a magnifying glass on you everywhere you go. I don't think Boston appreciates being kind of second class to New York in terms of the media capital of the world, but this is the media capital of the world as well. There's a lot of history here off the court.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"The community has integrated into the Celtics' team. That's probably the best way I could say it. The community is what makes the Celtics great here, the Boston pandemonium. That's what makes this space so loud and so special, and they take pride in it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"If any player is coming here, getting drafted here, thinking about coming here for free agency, getting traded here, I just think do your homework and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. That's something I could offer.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"He was just playing with a liberation within his game and came out knocking shots. That's what we need from him, is just to stay confident, stay fluid. He's been going a great job with the young guys on the bench as well, keeping them engaged.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think that's the next part of his evolution, including all of ours, is just continue to be a better teammate, regardless if you're shooting the ball or not. I think that helps reward you when you're doing those things.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, we just have to wait and see tomorrow, man. You know, change a few things up. Be prepared for what I'm getting myself into. My teammates, most importantly, and not making this about me or getting into the energy with anyone else other than my teammates. That's about it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, let's just call it what it is. When the fans are cheering, ""Kyrie sucks,"" they feel like they have a psychological edge, and that's fair. Of course, if I'm not making shots or turning the ball over, that makes it even more of a pressing issue that they can stay on me for.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think in order to silence even the self-doubt, let alone the crowd doubt, but the self-doubt when you make or miss shots, that's just as important as making sure I'm leading the team the right way and being human through this experience, too, and telling them how I feel.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I've had a few teammates be in this building with me for wins and losses, so I know what it feels like for both. I try to pay attention to the positive things that got us wins here earlier in my career, but also thinking about things that I can learn from in performances that I've had here where I didn't play up to par. It's just being honest about it and just breathing through the experience and having fun with it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, by just thinking about the goal that we have in front of us as best we can, and try not to get tired of everyone talking about the history that has not been made.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I've said it over the past 48 hours, just putting our best foot forward and just simplifying. It's basketball. Win, lose or draw, or win or lose, that's all that can happen.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Just want to be as prepared as we can for whatever the environment is going to be like in terms of what's expected from you. But what I'm sharing with my teammates now is just enjoy the moment. We got a chance to accomplish one of our goals, which is to make it back to Boston. We have another goal in front of us, and that's to make it back to Dallas.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,AL HORFORD,"No, I left home pretty early. My kids, they made the trip to Dallas. They were still sleeping when I left. So I think they felt the trip and everything. When I get home today, I'll get to spend time with them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we acknowledge that they got the best of us. Just trying to quickly shift our focus to this opportunity that we have here, Game 5 here at home. Yeah, we're looking for a good practice today, a good session to get back on track for tomorrow night.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,AL HORFORD,"It's going to be special. It's going to be special tomorrow. It's going to be electric. The fans, they've wanted to be a part of an opportunity and game of this magnitude with a chance that we have in front of us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,AL HORFORD,"So I know it's going to be electric here from before the game. I've been in these types of games, like where they are big games like that. The fans here, they are all into it. So I don't expect anything less.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,AL HORFORD,"People are going to use different things, and whatever you need to do, that's what will happen. For us, it's understanding the opportunity we have in front of us and making sure to take advantage of it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. I think we understand that they are a desperate team and they are playing probably a little freer. We know what that mindset is like. For us, it's really controlling what we can control and making sure that we are solid in the things that we need to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think they were just a tougher team. I think they locked into tendencies and played defense as a team and played very well.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think deep down, however long it takes, whatever it takes. No matter where it is.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nobody likes to get beat like that at any point in anybody's career in the season. But in the Finals, it also doesn't feel good. So really just want to get back out there and play again.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I was actually the first one up today, which is weird. I'm usually sleeping in. But it was cool just to have the kids. Got breakfast and really just enjoyed seeing them. I mean, being lovey and playing around. It's been a great morning.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know, a little bit of both. I think that they adjusted and they played very, very hard and very desperate. We have to do the same thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Working on Father's Day kind of sucks. You would think as fathers, we would get the whole day off. But I guess you guys want to talk to us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Father's Day is cool. I think this is maybe the second time that I've been in this type of situation, either on my birthday or Father's Day, where I'm still working. I'm not too mad at it, but I would like the day off.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's huge. Made it all the way back to Game 7. Knowing that feeling and remembering that feeling and using that feeling to boost our play and intensity is something that I obviously rely on them for.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. Again, I think a loss is a loss. It doesn't matter how it was lost or by how many points. I'm a competitor and I think we're competitors, and we want to win every game. You just have to take it on the chin, just like we did, and come back and try to prepare for Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"We are excited to get back on the court and put our best foot forward in Game 5. After a loss like that, you always feel like there's extra motivation to get back on the court and get going again.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"We haven't watched anything yet, but I'm sure we'll watch a little bit, at least, see what went wrong, what we can learn from it and how we can get better from it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"I wouldn't say it changes from win to loss. It's pretty similar every game, to be honest with you.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"I would say it's similar. I mean, you're never perfect in a win or a loss, so I feel like there's always room to grow and improve. And I think he does a good job of that, just keeping us grounded, even after we were on a 10-game winning streak before this in the playoffs, which is pretty rare.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"But also highlighting that that that's a pretty successful accomplishment, but coming off a loss like that, theres a lot to learn.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"I think Jayson said it the other night. We expect it to be as loud as it has been all season, and we are excited.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"You crave that as an athlete, as a player. You dream of it, and, you know, to be a part of it is pretty special as well.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"You know, it's a weird balance almost. It's hard to, like, take moral victories from that, but also in the same breath, you know, it's nice to see some go through on the offensive end and things like that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"But it's kind of a weird, fine line of pulling some good things from it but also understanding that we lost by 40.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"To be honest, like some of my best games I've had as a player are my worst-shooting performances in pregame shooting and shootaround, but some of my worst nights have been where I've felt really good in warmups. I feel like there's no correlation, to be honest with you. It's just the rhythm of the game and feel for the game when you're out there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I put Luka up for sure. Luka, Patrick Beverley. I dont know. The third one is up for debate.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I think it's definitely a bit of a challenge when you get to be where you feel like you do have spare time, and it's finding out the best ways to be able to use that spare time. For me, I enjoy being around my family and playing video games. I love FIFA. So that's usually what I do in my spare time. I love coffee. So I tend to really just do that type of thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Just drink a lot of water, man. That's my advice.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I think it's a little bit of everything. I think it's do-or-die, and I think we know that we weren't playing to the level that we should be playing. So I think whenever we play games like that, it's enjoyable. I think we need to continue to ride that momentum and make the adjustments from the game that we won and be ready to go for tomorrow night.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just piggybacking off what we did in Game 4, trying to take it to the next step, taking it one game at a time. Having a lot of patience and staying motivated, staying encouraged.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It's a long series. We can make it a long series if we do the right things. We have a small margin of error, and we are going to make sure that that margin stays small.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was a lot of fun being around the home crowd, had a lot of energy in the arena and just doing the things that just kind of like made the game fun. You know, you put a lot of love into the game, you get a lot of love back.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Trying to stay consistent in those areas, what we succeeded in, how we were there for each other and how we picked each other up and staying positive. That game, we were playing desperate. We didnt want to go home. Just give us some type of life, and that's what we did.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just brought me back to life in all honesty. I felt like I had a terrible start and I didn't really get to a point of playing until like the third because of the simple fact of the mistakes that I made out on the floor, which obviously, like at the end of the day, I'm never going to complain whenever they make that change, which is taking me often floor when I'm not out there being at my best.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Scored a couple of baskets down the stretch, got the blocks, gave us a lot of energy at the time because I felt like I was actually doing something to impact and help the team win. It was a breath of fresh air, I would say.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Last game, I felt like we got a lot more comfortable, wasn't worried about the mistakes or anything like that. Maybe I was worried about mine at the beginning but just throughout the game, just seeing how guys were playing and just the energy and the effort that was given out there on the floor it, would have been a big slap to the face to those guys if I would have never came out and did the same thing. Like I said, we got comfortable for sure just playing and having fun with the game, doing the right things.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, you know, I don't think he really said anything to the refs as much the last game. Just shows that he's taking that step in the right direction. We have to be able to do the same thing. When it comes to the path to success, there's a lot of failure in that. You have to use those failures as a lesson to really just go down that path and keep going and just find some type of way to be better than the last.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not lately. I would say living in the past when it comes to something like that, I feel that would pull me further away from the game where I am at right now. I dont really worry about how my journey started off, I care about how I finish my journey.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,Obviously we are going to be upbeat. We're focused throughout practice on what we have to do. It's just about being relaxed and making sure we're ready once the game comes.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"We know it's going to be loud and it's going to be an atmosphere the fans want to see them win, but it's our job to stop that as much as possible. We know it's going to be loud and rowdy. We just need to make sure that we stick to our game plan and stick together as a team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"I think that's the thing is making sure I stay ready and then when I come in, doing what I can, and that's bringing pace, trying to relieve as much as possible for Luka and Ky when Im out there bringing up the ball.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,But letting the game come to me as well. I think that's the most important thing. Not trying to go out there and score 50 points or whatever. It's just about playing in the game plan and attacking where I can attack.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"I do think so. I think it showed a lot about us. But I think the key for us is going to be do that when it gets hard and when it gets tough. We've seen where they hit a couple threes or coming out of a timeout, they will hit two or three threes, and it's just about how do we react to that and get back to our game plan.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's been a lot of reflecting on that. Even just looking at this year and playing in the NBA Finals and going to an Olympic Games, the two biggest stages in the world. So I think I'm forever grateful. It's easy to take it for granted, but I've been through injuries and not being able to play and missed out on events. I'm just making sure I do everything, and grateful that I'm on the court.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Hopefully. Obviously he had a great career. And if I can do something like that, it would be amazing. But it's going to start here, and hopefully we can get this next win and keep building with that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, that's the only way we can look at it. If we lose, we're going home. So we need to make sure that we win every quarter, every possession. I think that's kind of the mindset is make every possession important, and then if we do that, we can win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"I think it shows a lot of character with us with being able to fight. You know, we could have been on vacation now, but I think it shows how we want it as a team, and we are ready to fight for it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I would say Real Madrid is in a league of their own. They are at the top of the Euro. But obviously Boston has been -- I think Boston, Lakers, they are obviously the two major NBA teams in the league and they have been since day one. So it's obviously a little bit of comparison.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's obviously different because it's the Finals. Every team plays the whole season to be here. We are the one to be here in Boston, obviously. So it's a little bit different. But you've got to play basketball. You've got to give everything you have.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, we talk about it. I think the most important thing is to show that we believe. I think we showed in Game 4. If not, if we wouldn't believe, we probably wouldn't have won that game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"So I think obviously the talk is easy to talk about it, but then showing it is another thing. I think we showed it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,The change is we needed to win the game. I think we didn't play our best the first three games. So we had to change something and play better in Game 4.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"At this point in the season, a lot of things going on. If I'm playing, I'm fine. No worries.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I think everyone. Everyone. In the preseason, that was our key discussion, how to talk on defense. When we put it together and we play good defense, everybody is talking. Communication is a big part of our success on defense.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,Not really. Just happy being a father. It's been the best thing in my life. So that's it. Just being happy.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,It was a very special moment. I know they are both -- I think they are very proud of their sons. So they are happy that we're happy on the court together.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"We have a great group, resilient group, and we don't like to lose. We do our best to prepare each and every night, each and every game, and we look forward to the next game on the schedule.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just by being disciplined. Controlling the pace. Felt like there was a lot of stoppages in Game 4 where they were blowing the whistle a lot. But we want to get up and create more of a pace to the game, and I think that helps dictate.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we are ready for Game 5. I think that's the best answer that I got. I think that we're ready. We're at home, and we're looking forward to it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's definitely a blessing to be here, to represent the Celtics, my family, the organization, the community, our greater community. It's an honor that I don't take lightly. So just to come out every night and play for something, for what I represent, I think that matters.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"My relationship with Boston has grown. I've been here for almost nine years now, since I was 18, 19 years old. I've grown up. I've become a man here. Boston is special. I'm looking forward to Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just that you can't take it for granted, and it's going to be difficult. You're going to have to fight and just stay in the moment. That's what matters the most. We come out and be a team. Win as a team, lose as a team. Just come out and be the best versions of ourselves.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the only experience that you can really experience that you can really speak from in the playoffs. At this level, you have some very talented basketball players who are going to be on the floor, and you've got to bring it every single night. And if you don't, you can see what happens.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,This is what we all work for. We are at the precipice of completing what we set out to do at the beginning of the season.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"So I think it's not difficult to get everybody in that locker room on the same page right now. It just needs to remind everybody that it's just one possession at a time. We do it together and we fight like our lives depends on it, and I think we'll be all right.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,A simple way an ass kicking. Thats the simplest way right there.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we felt good, felt confident. Just didnt play the way weve been playing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Not exactly. But, as weve seen today, they just played harder, and thats unacceptable.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that they played harder. Every loose ball, 50-50 ball, they got to it. Honestly, the turnovers, missed shots -- combined thats not a winning recipe.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. Like you said, a year ago this time, we were down 0-3 and we were essentially fighting for our lives.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So very short answer, yeah, we understand what it's like from their point of view, and you know, they came out super aggressive. They played extremely fast and took more shots than we did. You know, they were really concentrating on attacking the offensive glass. They got way more rebounds than we did.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So, you know, they played harder tonight. Obviously, we didn't shoot the ball well at all. It's something that we can learn from.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Give them credit. They played well tonight and we didn't. We had the right mindset and right intentions. We wanted to come out and play super well and win, but it just didn't go that way tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"But, you know, we are fortunate. We get another opportunity on Monday.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, not to harp on it too much. It happened. We can't change what happened tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, we always say you lose by two or you lose by 30 they all count the same. But we do need to be better. We're not making any excuses. We need to be better, and we will. We will be better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think we were a little -- I think this is the most stagnant that we've been this series and the worst job of owning our space on the offensive end and doing what we wanted to do instead of what they were forcing us to do. And, you know, we did a great job of that the first three games, and this one, we didn't.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I think it starts on the defensive end for us. We didn't get many stops. So they were allowed to set their defense up, and just naturally, when you're scoring at a high rate, you feel good about yourself. Your energy is higher. Tend to probably play better defense.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So it all starts on the defensive end. We've just got to do a much better job containing them, making it tougher, and getting stops.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"A little bit of both. You have to, to move on from it, win or a loss. We're obviously going to watch film and see a lot of things that we need to clean up and do better. But you can't worry about it too much because we have another game on Monday.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Like I said, not making any excuses. We've got to be a lot better, and I believe that we will.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I think it's going to be as loud as it's ever been, in my seven years of being a Celtic. Excited to go back home. Celebrate Father's Day on Sunday and compete for a championship on Monday. So it should be a lot of fun.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's not quite there, but we're going to make him available. But we're only going to use him in very specific instances if necessary.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just have an understanding of the environment. So at the end of the day, both teams have to keep the same edge and same chip on their shoulder. But you can't be distracted by anything. It really doesn't matter what kind of game it is. If you don't run back on defense, you can't win. If you don't rebound, you can't win. If you don't execute, you can't win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So just focusing on the details, the effort, the execution, all the things that go into winning regardless if it's preseason, regular season, postseason, or the Finals. The process towards winning remains the same. We just have to hammer that home and for however long it takes, stick to that process.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Not quite there. He's available but only in very specific situational instances.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah. He's not quite there. He's available. We'll use him in very specific instances laughter.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I haven't really thought about that. Focused on Game 4. One of my favorite places in the world, so that's it for now.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, I have different routines, whether home or away, but they are relatively the same. Yeah, about the same.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think obviously having an understanding of the environment and what we are trying to accomplish. But I think we've done that throughout most of the season when we've been able to dominate the transitions and the margins of the game, and when we've played well and not played well, still give ourselves a chance because of the margins and the discipline in these things.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Dallas is a great opponent because they test your discipline, like every single possession, and the second that you're not where you're supposed to be or you don't execute your angles properly, they take advantage of it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So our opponent has forced us to work to be more disciplined, and we have to stay that way for however long the series continues.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"You can definitely take something from it but at the same time, I thought Dallas played great. Give a lot of credit to them. You know, all their guys, whoever went in, well-balanced.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Thought they played with a ton of energy and physicality. You've got to give them that. And they are a great team, and that's Dallas. That's the reason why they are here when they play like that. But you can definitely take some stuff from it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"They did a great job flying around, making indecision on whether to shoot it or drive and their multiple efforts. And I thought their five men did a great job protecting the paint. Whenever we went in for a layup, they had multiple guys contesting. I thought they did a great job flying around on the defensive end.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I don't know, always in situations like this, it always goes back to us. But you have to give Dallas credit. They played well. They played really, really well. And that's the reason why that they're in this, is because when they play like that. So I thought they just outplayed us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Preparation doesn't guarantee an automatic success. And so I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn't think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"You have to prepare to put yourself in the best possible position, but it doesn't guarantee anything. At the end of the day, we have to just maintain our process and get ready for Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Anytime there's two-on-ones and little indecisions, they do a great job cutting behind you and wedging under and getting in. I thought Lively was great in that. We had 26 misses in the first half and only two offensive rebounds, and they had more. So we've got to be better in our defensive rebounding, and we have to be better getting offensive rebounds when we miss.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I learned that Dallas is a great team and you're going to have to earn it. There's a lot of stuff that we can control. We'll go back on the film and we'll watch that, and we'll really try to be disciplined and control it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't know. I thought Dallas played really -- the more I said it, because you have to give them credit. It's not about us. It's about our opponent and having respect for them. And you have to give them credit for how well they played, and that's the most important thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,So it's less about us and more about how they played. They played well. They played hard. We have to be more disciplined in how we defend and attack them.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,It wasn't as good as Dallas's was. I thought theirs was a lot better.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,I'm not comfortable. We got to win. We got to have a lot more wins. We got to win a lot more of the little battles. Got to stay disciplined. We just got to replicate what we did this game. Do it the next one.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"A mix between a bunch of fruits -- not vegetables -- bunch of fruits, and just some recovery stuff. Making sure by body don't cramp or anything like that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"They're my family. We've developed a lot of trust with one another, a lot of chemistry. That trust just comes down to if you get blown by, they know I have their back. Just at the same time, I know if I got blown by, I got people behind me to back me up. It's really just doing whatever up can to make sure whenever one steps, we're all stepping with him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,It's for her. She helped me make it. She's going to help me make a lot more. She helped me make the free throw. She helped me make reads.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,I'm just happy for having Luka pass me the ball in that position. I'm happy I knocked it down. Just got to be able to make the next one.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"If they leave me open in the corner, I'm going to get them up, for sure. It's just having that trust. Luka is going to give me the ball. As soon as I shot it, he kind of jumped for joy when it went in. Just having that reaction from my teammates is just amazing. Makes you want to just learn, just practice and just do more.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Whatever doesn't kill you really makes you stronger. No matter how many times you get hit, knocked down, get up, get up harder than you got knocked down. Hit them harder than they hit you.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"As I jogged down, I slowly heard it. It kept getting louder and louder. Whenever you have the fans hyped like that, backing you up, it makes you want to play that much more free, with that much more energy.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"I'm happy he was able to get out there, feel the energy, feel everything about the experience. He hasn't been able to step on the floor for a long time now because he has been hurt.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just going out there, I was telling him to slow down, just enjoy it, feel your way through this game. Don't rush anything, just feel your way through the game, find little holes, absorb it all.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"I know he did. I know he's thinking about a lot of things, but I got a lot of trust in O Max.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"I wouldn't say it's comfortability. I feel like we go out there and we play like we're desperate. That's the mentality we need to have in these games, going out there doing whatever you can to win. No matter if you're diving out of bounds, diving at the ball, chesting up with somebody, trying to be aggressive and strong.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"A lot of this playoff season, playoff series, has just been finding out who we are, finding how much can we get hit and then throw one back. It's definitely been an enjoyable time to just see my teammates and myself just grow and adapt with one another with what's going on on the floor.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, he trusts us. He trusts us to know he's going to play the best defense he can with as much energy as he's got. If they get by him, he knows we're going to back him up. He knows exactly what we're going to do and how we have his back.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Only thing I told him, Look, going out there, first two times you get fouled, don't say nothing to the refs. That's all I got. Just please don't do that, and I'll make sure you get open, make sure you're going be comfortable on the offensive and defensive end.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"So just knowing that whenever he is going out there playing defense and he's locked in on defense, he just makes everything fall into place better on the offensive end.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,I wouldn't say we're overly happy. We enjoyed this win. But we're not jumping for joy. We got to win. We do what we need to do for this game. Now it's getting into Game 5.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We're going into another hostile environment. Now we just got to take from what we did this game, learn to how they're going to adapt to this game, do whatever we can to emulate, make this happen again.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a really good question in the sense of the talk is, you know, no different than 1, 2 or 3. You know, we have a game plan. We've got to play faster. We've got to guard the three.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about the record or the series is 3-0, somewhere in this game, there's going to be a point where either team is going to have to make a stand or they let go of the rope.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"And so that's just human nature. And so if it happens to be us in the sense we are down or we're fighting to get back in the game, there's going to be a point, if there's going to be a fight, or do we just concede.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Or vice versa, where Boston goes, we've got another one on Monday. That's what -- there will be a point in this game where someone is going to have to make a stand or they let go especially of the rope. We'll see when that point comes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I think when you talk about the three games, getting off to a good start is one, and then the fight at the end. You know, we're playing from behind, and we have to play perfect. These are positive things.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But again, we have to play with pace. And somewhere between the second quarter and third quarter we tend to just walk the ball, and that's the benefit to Boston. Tonight we have to leave the -- the gas tank has to be empty at the pace of not walking but running for 48 minutes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think -- I don't get involved with the medical. So I just repeat questionable or probable or whatever he's taking.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,So I let that -- that's between medical and the player. So I can't comment about what -- if he taking a shot.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But injuries are part of the game, and it's June. Everybody's sore and tired mentally. And so it's about survival. It's about being able to understand if you've been here before, you have to train to play to June. And so these are a lot of lessons, not just for Luka but a lot of my guys are learning.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Great question. I think when you talk about our bench, we need everybody to score. And then when you talk about our team, we need everybody to score more points. It's not just our bench. It's not just Luka and Ky scoring. We need everybody to pitch in.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,We are getting great looks. Unfortunately we just haven't made them. So tonight hopefully is the night that everybody will be able to score.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But our bench has been, you know, someone that has helped us win in the playoffs, and we are going to need them tonight. Someone off the bench, Maxi, D-Live, Josh, Exum, someone has to be able to step up and make an open shot for us tonight, and we truly believe that will happen.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at today's athlete, the game of sport is not to be perfect. It's just, you know, to win. And when you look at what's come out here in the last day or so, if you've watched the Mavs, Luka has improved his defense. But we are asking him, or some are asking him, to be a shutdown defender.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Well, he's never been on an All-Defensive Team, but he's been on five All-Pro Teams, first team. So that means he's one of the top five players in the world, and he's playing the game the right way where he can find open guys.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But when you're on the biggest stage, there's got to be -- someone's got to poke a hole. This will only make the great ones better. When you look at, we talked about it yesterday, with LeBron, Michael, the greats, the G.O.A.T.s, they all were poked at and they came back stronger and better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I truly believe Luka will come back stronger and better. Some criticize that he could never get this far. But he's here. And unfortunately as a team, he said it best We win together and we lose together. And that's -- we lost three in a row. We are trying to find a way tonight to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But sometimes when you are a free agent in the media business, you've got to say something crazy to get a new contract, or likes, or clicks.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"No, I think it's just everybody has -- this is a free country. Everybody has the right to their opinion.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is a special group when you talk about that group in that locker room. They protect one another. They play for one another. They play the game the right way. They cheer for one another.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,And so is there extra? I don't think there's going to be extra. I think the motivation right now is to get off to a good start and find a way to get a win.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But nothing changes about the way the group feels about Luka. Tonight I expect everybody to play their A Game. I think sometimes we -- you know, the Celtics are a good team. Let's not forget that. It's not that we are not playing defense or it's been blowouts. It's just been a couple mistakes that they have taken advantage of that we will learn from as we go forward, and if we are ever in this situation again, hopefully we can use that experience.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,D Live was great. His energy was great. His ability to give us second opportunities. He displayed his range tonight with the corner three.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"He was really good. He's been good. Giving us second opportunities, picking up a foul, getting the offensive rebound, was needed. I thought he did a really good job this evening.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"We had to play our A game. It was this or we go on vacation. I thought the group did a great job of not pressing, letting the game happen. The flow was there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"We've done this in the first three games. It's just we haven't been able to capitalize. We made the mistakes, and they've capitalized on it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"They shot the three well. We tried to keep them off the free-throw line tonight, not give them second opportunities. I thought they did a really good job of being able to execute the game plan and let the game come to us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,We made awesome shots. Our role players stepped up and made some threes. That's what we needed tonight.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he was great. He's been great. Some would say differently. He's averaging over 25 in this series, I think. He's playing at a very high level.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,I don't know so much respond. He's been doing everything for us on the offensive end and defensive end. I thought he played his game tonight. He didn't force anything. I thought he was rebounding and let other guys...,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"With the pace, we talked about it, we got to play faster. I thought he set the pace for us tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I thought they were great. It was a carryover from Game 3. I thought the energy group that ended in Game 3, fourth quarter, the group, energy and pace on both ends. Defensively we got stops. Offensively we got into the paint where we could capitalize. I thought Josh's energy has been great.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"The defense, again, in this series has been really good. It's just for us, it comes down to not making a mistake at the wrong time, and tonight we didn't do that. We capitalized on their mistakes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"It thought it was great. He was Luka. He's been Luka. There wasn't a different Luka out there. He played at a high level. He was great. He's been great. He's one of the best players in the world. As much as we want to criticize, he's a hell of a player.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, the score. It's real simple. We don't have to complicate this. This isn't surgery.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate. Understand, we made a stand. We were desperate. We got to continue to keep playing that way understand they're trying to find a way to close the door.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight you saw that. They let go of the rope, you know, pretty early.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"No, he was in the right spot. He took it from there. He can shoot. That's the next step for his development, is being able to shoot the three. He's young. But as a 20-year-old, he's grown up in the AAU circuit where in high school, he could shoot, he could handle. He'd tell you he played point guard.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"His ability to be able to bring the ball, being able to shoot the three is the next step for him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"He has all the skill set. Right now, for the role we need him to do, is do what he did tonight offensive rebound, change shots and be able to guard.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's who we've been all season. Exum has played at a high level for us all season. He's been able to run the offense. He stepped up and made big shots for us to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Then I thought tonight even the one he shot from out of bounds, he made it, that could easily have changed his confidence. He was aggressive while he was out on the floor. He was great. We're going to need that on the road.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, again, we are desperate. The ball starts to move. Guys are not overthinking it. Again, being able to make some threes tonight from our role players were huge when you talk about D Jones, Exum and then D Live.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,Just understanding that's who we've been all season. We can shoot with the best of them. Tonight we displayed that.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think, again, we have nothing to lose going to Boston. That mindset of being aggressive.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Then to answer the first part of your question, Luka, as we know, can play defense. You saw that tonight. Some of the criticism that he's had here of late, for whatever reason, talked about his defense. I think he stepped up and was there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"He knows in Boston he's going to be right back in the pick-and-roll, so he's going to have to compete and play defense again.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I thought everybody who participated today was ready. I thought O Max, as a rookie coming off of injury, I thought he did a good job getting his first minutes in the Finals.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just by putting it into perspective what we're up against. History is going to be made either way. We'd like to be on the right side of it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It just comes from the same sentiment, same phrase I was using the other day, just putting our best foot forward. We felt like Game 3 we had a good chance to close out that game to at least put is in a competitive spot.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,We waited until Game 4 to ultimately play our best game. Took long enough for all of us to get to the party together and to play for each other the way we did tonight.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But it's definitely a possibility that we can replicate it. We understand we're going against the same great Boston team that is going to make it tough. We're going into their home den. We have another opportunity to extend the season. That's all we can ask for. We handled our business tonight. But the job is still an uphill battle, and we understand that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It was how we started off the game. Our ability to go home, get some rest, not having the same 48 hours to get our bodies ready and recover. So it felt like it was pretty much the regular season in terms of that aspect.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think he made a few people eat their words. In a healthy way -- I'll say that in a healthy way. I don't want to curse up here or anything like that, get into any unnecessary beef, right, between us as players and the media.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think this is his first opportunity and first taste of what it's like to be on this stage, and to not play up to your capabilities or be out there toward the end of the game where every mistake is magnified. I think that's probably what I'm really referring to, is when every mistake is magnified, there is going to be a response. That's your guys' job to give us your criticism. We go home and deal with it in a healthy way, hopefully.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think with Luka, like I've been reiterating to the guys, stay off social media as best you can, man. Enjoy the moment we're in. It's not about making it this far. It's figuring out of the little nuances to get wins on this stage. That's what it's about for us as competitors and that's where our focus should be.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,He responded very well. I expected it. I think a lot of people expected it that have seen Luka and known Luka. Just didn't know how it was going to happen. He made some things happen tonight that I was very proud of him. He grew.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what we've been talking about, too, since the beginning of the series, is our growth, us trending in the right direction, figuring out how we get wins together as a group with all those external factors still going on. How do you still lock in, how do you still focus in, breathe through some of those mistakes. I think he did a great job of that tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Hopefully, we can still extend this series going into Game 5. But we still know we have to play our best and control what we can control.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,Yeah. Crazy.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It's taken time, I tell you that. It's difficult because, as a competitor, you try not to display all your emotions out there to give an edge.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Rightfully so, yeah.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think it shows you how important it is to have quality leaders in the locker room and somebody that has been through it, somebody that can talk through it, and also somebody that's more than willing to sacrifice themselves to take the bullets and the brunt of the responsibility.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"He knows how important it is for us to focus on the right things. We can't be focused on answering all these unfair, critical questions. Some of them may be fair, right? But if you're not necessarily out there playing with us, it's going to be hard for us to connect if you're talking s--- about one of our teammates.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"We're not going to go for it. I think that's what you're seeing. Not just from us, but our head coach.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"He's dealt with his fair share of criticism from some of you guys in this room, some guys in the past. Some of you criticize him as a coach, rightfully so, like I said.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think if it goes over a certain boundary, you're going to see a real humans step up and protect their brother or sister. I think that's what you saw from J Kidd. I am proud of him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I have the same sentiment. That's out little brother right there. He's in the Finals. He's going to make mistakes. That's also why I kind of had that kind of peaceful sentiment about me after the game. I'm not about to go up to Luka and say, It's all your fault. That's not how it works in our locker room. We dang sure don't want to start those bad habits now. I've been on teams where we have allowed the media or opinions to infiltrate what we have going on, and it has not worked out well.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think if we put our best foot forward and focus on the things we can control, we got a good thing going here.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, if you're familiar with D Live's game, you know in high school he was shooting those threes. He was on a pretty good team that ended up winning a few championships together. D Live had an expanded game, sort of to say, when he was in high school. It's crazy. I was watching highlights not too long ago.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I think what we have to also account for is we're in a very physical game. When you're getting beat up like that out there every single play, you're going to have something to say to the refs.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"In Luka's case, his relationship with the refs is not always the healthiest during games. The referees are humans, too. We have to respect what they do. They're a big part of this game, too. It could sway either way.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think what you're seeing is him just taking accountability as best he can at this point in his life. He's a young person, still trying to figure it out. I give him that grace.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Also, we have to give him a little tough love where we let him know and reiterate you got to stay off those guys a little bit.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I think it's just lessons being learned. When he is locked in like that, not paying attention to the refs, he's a huge, impactful player for us, and a great leader for us. We want him to stay consistent on that and not be too hard on himself either. If he gets a tech, so be it. No one is batting an eye. If we're trying to get back into the game and we need the refs, there has to be a different perspective, different approach you got to take.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Sometimes a good conversation works with the refs. Sometimes eye-to-eye conversation works with them. When you're s--- talking them, MF'ing them all the time, it can get to them too. I'm not saying we're all perfect, but we have to use everything to our advantage on a positive note.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I think it was more about Dallas. You know, I felt like they were the better team tonight, clearly. They played much better, and you've got to give them credit.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I felt like we came out determined. They were the better team. They were the team that was playing harder. He's right.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we have an opportunity here to be better, and it all starts with us going over this film and having a good practice session and understanding the opportunity we have in front of us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,So that's what we're going to do.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I just know, there could have been some of that. Ultimately, you know, I felt like they were the better team tonight. We can say all these things about us. They played much better than us. They clearly outplayed us, and that's tough to take but that's the reality.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I don't know specifically. It just seemed like a lot of stuff was going their way, and I'm just eager to just look at this film and get together and see how we can be better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"The one thing I can tell you about our group is that time and time again, we've responded any time we have adversity, and this is an opportunity that we have here front of us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. We definitely have to be better. Have to be more active and make sure that we're a little more aware of him, and it's something that I expect us to be better come Monday.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I feel like every series kind of has a life of its own. But yeah, they were in a position that their backs were against the wall, and they did what they were supposed to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"It is hard to win on the road. And even though we've had a lot of success this postseason on the road, you know, they had the momentum. They kept it going, and that was a big difference. Their crowd really rallied behind them and I feel like that helped them throughout.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's hard. It's a playoff series. Teams are going back and forth. Usually, you know, I've been in a lot of these, and usually by the second game, you're making adjustments. Third game, you're making another adjustment, and that's kind of how it is.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"And for us, we've had the first three games, we didn't really make any adjustments. So today, they did something. We have to see what we can -- how we can be better and prepare for it. That's kind of where we're at right now.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"But, you know, it's the playoffs, and, you know, they are fighting for their lives, and they played better than us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,I think we always fall back on our work and preparation and understanding what we need to do. It's not going to be any different now.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's a good question. Understanding that it's one game. You know, after we won Game 1, we put that behind us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"You know, Game 2, kind of same thing and so on, and we are at this point now. You know, we have to take some things that we can be better at and try to fix them, and then you know, others kind of throw them out and just kind of do that and make sure that we come out and we play Celtics basketball.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I think ultimately that's what it comes down to for us, and there's a lot of things that we can control and that I expect us to be much better on Monday.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Take care of the things that we can control. Got to fight for rebounds. We've got to, me in particular, not turn the ball over and just be aggressive. Be the more desperate team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I mean, I wouldn't say throw it away. We've got to learn from it. Things that we have to go back and watch. Again, see the things that we should have controlled and done better doing that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,But going back and watching film and getting better.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"In particular, no. I think they let me play one-on-one, so whenever I drive, I think they all kind of space out and let me try to play one-on-one at the basket. Just got to do better playing off my teammates and finishing at the rim.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"We learn from wins, too. Wins we have opportunities to get better. Again, same thing with losses.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"So not sure it changes much. Got to get home. Get our rest, hydrate and lock back in.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think winning is hard. I think winning at any game is hard. But winning Game 4 of the NBA Finals is pretty damn hard. So no, I think they came out desperate and I think they punched us in the mouth, and we couldn't kind of recover the way we wanted to.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I guess a massive win would be -- I don't know. I think role players came in and they felt good. Obviously they are at home. But things that we have to control, we'll do our best to do that and come back at home and do the best we can to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know. I don't know. Even though I've done it. You've got to do it together as a team. Everybody has to be clicking and being, again, the more desperate team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"We've just got to go back home. I think locking into tendencies, locking into the game plan, and I think we'll be okay.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I thought we got a lot of good shots. I think a lot of them didn't fall. A lot of the plays we made before didn't go in the hoop. You saw a couple go in and out. Again, just a couple plays didn't go our way.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"So credit to Dallas. They played extremely hard. They played desperate, and we've got to do the same.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think the series is we are up 3-1 going back to Boston.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"That was a butt whupping. Thats it. They just beat us. Not much to it, honestly. They just beat us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Its a learning lesson, for sure. Got to show up and show out every night. Theyre not going to roll over. Theyre down 3-1 now. Theyre desperate, so theyre not going to roll over. Theyre not going to make it easy on us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, Im sure well break it down, learn from it and take what we need to get better at and any carry it on to Game 5.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,SAM HAUSER,Be better. About it.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,SAM HAUSER,Cant wait. Wish we could do it right now.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"I think for me, it's just come in and do what I do with my minutes. I think obviously Luka creates a lot of attention. Just using that to my advantage to get downhill. I've been super confident in my shot all year. Unfortunate that one of them was taken away. I just have to stay confident and keep shooting.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"No, I think just the energy that we showed throughout the team. Even when stuff didn't go our way, it wasn't heads down. It was next possession, next possession. That's something we've kind of preached the whole series. I think we were finally able to do that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I mean, you said it. A lot of the times guys go through ups and downs. It's just about getting back in the gym, doing our craft, what we know. Whether that's lifting, shooting, extra reps, anything. You see everyone on this team doing that. And it shows on the court.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"No, no. I think obviously Luka has to hold himself to a high standard. Him fouling out doesn't give us the best position to win. Obviously we need him on the court, and he knows that. I know he's going to, as a competitor, hold himself accountable. We did, too.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"One of the biggest things is I go on the court and I think I'm going to be on Tatum or Brown. Kyrie is, No, I've got him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"I think that's huge. I can press the ball, be up and play on the help side. I mean, just for Kyrie to kind of step up and say, I'm going to take that defensive challenge, it's huge for us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Like I said, there's a lot of ups and downs that go through a series. Just the Playoffs in general. I think we knew kind of what we can do and how we can be. Obviously, we know not every game is going to be like that. I think if we stick to kind of who we are as a team and stay positive, we just need to take one game at a time.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"I think criticism is always going to come when we lose. I think if we won a game or two, the criticism isn't as bad.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"J Kidd, he played, so he understands it. All competitors, they're going to take it on the chin, come out. That's the challenge that we have to do every game. Obviously, we watch it because we're on our phones a lot. It's just coming out and playing our basketball, and that's what we did.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think it's contagious. I come in, I do it. Everyone starts to build that pace. Everyone's running their lanes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Just helps out my team. We were locked in, especially on the defense end. We played with pace. It helped them. I'm here to help them in every way I can. We just got to play like that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it doesn't change anything. Like I said at the beginning of the series, it's first to four. We going to believe until the end. So we just got to keep going. I have big belief in this team that we can do it, so we just got to keep believing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,It's big. It's basketball. It's five people on the floor. So that's huge for us. Everybody played with a lot of energy. That's how we got to do it. We got to think the same way in Game 5 in Boston.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't know what I learn of myself. Ask me the next day, I'll come up with the answer. I don't know really right now smiling.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,But it's going to take everything. It's going to take energy -- especially energy -- because it's late in the season. We played a lot of games. We got to stay together and locked in.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"No, he didn't say anything to me specifically. But that speaks a lot about him. He always has players' backs. He always support us. That's a big thing, to have a coach like that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Big-time, man. I think people forget he's a rookie. He's a rookie doing this stuff. He's been amazing the whole season. Just watching him grow was unbelievable.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,All right. 1-for-1 -- he's 100 in the Playoffs.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,I don't even know how to answer that. Next question.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Give credit to Dallas. I think they played hard physically, and then they dominated the glass. I think that was the key that put a lot of pressure on us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"And then we didn't make shots tonight, and I think that's where, you know, we allowed them to play free, once we get them multiple opportunities to make shots, and then also we didn't hit shots on the other end.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"We're going to look at the film and see where we can better, and then go from there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's a great opportunity to respond. Give credit to Dallas. They came out and they played with force, and they played great.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"We just regroup. We keep our same mentality, and we come out and get ready to fight in another battle on our home floor.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"We learn from it. We take it. We don't dismiss it. We're going to learn from it. We're going to see how and why, exactly where the game was won and lost. And then we take those experiences and then we come out and we play like our life depends on it. Because it does.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Close-out games are hard. Close-out games are tough. They always have been like that, and you've got to have extreme focus. You've got to come out and meet their intensity to finish things out.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"So we didn't do that tonight. Give credit to Dallas. I thought they played extremely well. Those guys, they crashed, they rebounded and they played with force. Some of those other guys stepped up. We've got to be better and we've got to have some of our guys step up, and that's what it takes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,I felt like the pace slowed down a little bit which allowed them to dictate what they wanted to do. I think we have to continue to keep the pace but have some more poise. Just see where we can be better. We'll watch film and we'll see.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Right now, it feels raw, so we've just got to look at film and go from there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"These are the moments that can make you or break you. We have to reassemble. We have to look at it and learn from it, and then we've got to embrace it and attack it. It's going to be hard to do what we're trying to do. We didn't expect anything to be easy, but it's no reason to lose our head.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Tip your cap to Dallas. They came out and played well, and we've just got to be better on the next one.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure as of yet. But we're going to watch it. We're going to learn from it. As of now, we've just got to be better. We have to meet their intensity. It's the NBA playoffs. It's the Finals. Looking forward to the next one.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah. He was excited for me to be here. I think he was like, I remember watching you when I was with the select team at USA, and I think he just saw something in me then, that he believed I could help us win games.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"He's a great basketball mind, and it just goes to show you never really know who's watching.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I remember he told me about what it was going to be like to play for the Celtics and the crowd, the city, everything. It's just been so much better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,I love playing there and just competing in the TD Garden. Hardy was amazing for me. He's an amazing coach. I think he kind of undersold it a little bit.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, it's playing with great players. They put me in a position to be in those moments, and they trust me. Just try to be confident throughout it all and just trust the work that I've put in.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say he was a big talker. He just gets it done. Both sides of the court, just his physicality, just impacts the game in so many different ways. Just does literally everything on the court, and just does it at a really high level.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"No, I mean, you knew he was a big-time competitor. You don't guard the way he guards and not be a big-time competitor. But you don't really see all the little things he does until you see it like day in and day out and just the way he just impacts winning every second he's out there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I think we just locked in. I don't know exactly what it is. But we're just locked in. We know what's at stake. We understand that close-out games are the toughest, and we just come with an extra edge. It's going to be even harder tomorrow, and we've got to be even better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I think from our experiences over the past couple of years, the thing that we've really gotten a lot better at is not relaxing, not being complacent. From game to game or series to series, we always want more.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Maybe in recent years we took things for granted at some points or were happy to make it to certain rounds, where now we're not satisfied.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Even now up 3-0, nobody is celebrating or anything. We still feel like there's a lot more that we can do. There's a lot more that we want to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"From that standpoint, just not being complacent and everybody just wanting more and being true to that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"You said Summer League? I was excited to finally put on an NBA jersey. I was young. I was 19. I was overwhelmed. Everything was new to me, from being at the new practice facility.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I remember going through Summer League practice with -- JB was on the team, obviously, and learning from him and learning from the assistant coaches. Jerome Allen was there Micah Shrewsberry was one of the coaches. It was a hell of an experience, in Utah and in Vegas.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I was just so happy to be in the NBA at the time that -- I was really a kid. It was a great experience, and obviously we've grown a lot since then. But I was just so happy to be there and put on that jersey for the first time.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, ever since I've been in the NBA, especially with the Celtics, everybody knows we only hang up championship banners, and it's been a while since we've won one. Ever since '08, the goal is to win another one every single year. Gotten close plenty of times.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"It's just an honor. It's a honor to wear this jersey. It's an honor to follow in the footsteps of some of the best players ever. Being a part of Celtics history entails that you've got to win a championship. Every kid growing up playing basketball dreams about being in the Finals, dreams about winning a championship. I'm no different than anybody else.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I credited last year a lot to the success that we're having this season. We were so consumed with getting back to the Finals, in a good way, but I think especially when we got to the Playoffs, we were just ready to get back to June. In some ways skipping steps.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Those series took longer than they maybe should have, and we acknowledge that. We could have closed games out a lot earlier.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"You find yourself in a hole down 0-3, the margin for error is so small. Last year, we really believed that we could take it one game at a time and come back from that series.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"But last year was a great learning experience. For one, to not take things for granted. You're never promised to make it back to the Finals. I think each and every person this year has came into the season with a different mindset. I think it has truly shown that we don't take things for granted, and we approach every single day the same.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I was born in '98, so I didn't really know about all the championships before. I knew Bill Russell won a lot. I knew Bird had a couple. But I only ever saw '08, and then when they lost in 2010. I learned a lot about the history of the game, the history of the Celtics.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,I would say the first legend I met was Paul Pierce. I met him during that -- it might have been Summer League or my first training camp he was around for a few days. That was the first Celtics legend I really got to talk to.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I think our ability to go over situational basketball during practice. Joe and the coaching staff, they do a great job of showing us a lot of different things throughout the season of how games end, whether it's teams being up six, do you foul, or closing out quarters and how that can have an effect for the start of the next quarter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So going over situational basketball in practice and in shootarounds and understanding what we want to do in those moments, what plays and reads we want to go over in late-game situations, so when those moments do come about throughout the game, we're comfortable. We know what we're trying to run, what we're trying to get to, the different options from each set.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,Just our ability to translate the things that we go over in practice to the game and do it without skipping a beat.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I didn't know that. That would be really cool. But you know, you guys will probably say we didn't play anybody to get here. So we'll just have to do it again next year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I really don't listen to a lot of them. I don't really have a favorite quote.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's a great player. Just tried to make things tough, make him hit tough one-on-one buckets over and over again. That's kind of what we're living with.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just like to show the world that I'm a good defender and I can guard some of the best guys in the world, especially those two. They're the best. Just doing my job, staying in front, making things tough. I try to take pride in that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's tough when you're playing limited minutes and he hasn't played at times, so when you see a guy like that hit a three that's been -- he works his tail off. It's great to see. It's rewarding. He performed really well yesterday guarding, and then obviously I just thought that three was a big momentum shift.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's the hardest thing in any sport, but especially basketball. Playing limited minutes, going back and forth, limited shots, it's not easy. It can be mentally really difficult.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He just gets his work in. He's been able to stay level-headed through the ups and downs, and it's been great to see. He's hit really big shots, and he hit three last night. But just his work. He works on his shot all the time. It's been good.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,The job ain't finished. We ain't celebrating like we won a championship yet. We've still got one more to do. We weren't really talking about anything but getting it done.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,He's really himself. He's like authentic to himself. We all appreciate that. Like he's not trying to be somebody he's not.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"So I think that's kind of like the sicko side of it. He's different, but we respect that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Then the basketball genius, you can learn a lot from him as to how he sees the offensive side of things, the play calling, the game management, all that. He's elite in that.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"The first one, I think our analytics department does a tremendous job. Dave Sparks and the gang is a conduit to that on the coaching staff. We have a ton of conversations about what makes sense from an analytical perspective and how do you constantly find small ways to give yourself the best chance to win, but also increase your chances of winning.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"In our department, that just makes the most sense to us. Gives us the best chance to win and allows us to control the variables of the game, especially when teams don't have a timeout, which they didn't last night.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So it's a credit to them, just bringing constant trends within the game that I feel like give us an advantage and increase winning any chance you can go.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's a little bit, one percent better, save a half a point, save a point, save .9 of a point, it makes a big difference over time.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Second one, I think just having an understanding from a player, just looking at the lens from a player's perspective. I think sometimes when you become a coach you look at it from a coach's perspective, but at the end of the day the world revolves around the guys and how they view things and the lens with which they look at things.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So you have to alter your communication. You have to alter your schedule. You have to alter things that put the players in the best possible decision to succeed. So a lot of the decisions that I make, it's like, what would I have wanted as a player. We have a ton of former players on staff that are able to help with that, so I think that's the biggest thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,I would hope he does not feel undervalued by us because I think he has done a lot of tremendous things as a player and as a person.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So no, I think he's one of the ultimate values. I think to have a guy like him be able to dominate the intangibles of the game on both ends of the floor is amazing to us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"We wouldn't be in this position without any of our guys, and he's included in that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the thing you just can't take for granted in the game today is a coach's greatest gift is a group of guys that want to be coached, want to be led, that also empower themselves.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think at the end of the day, just appreciate the fact that we have an environment where learning and coaching is important, and getting better and developing is important.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"You can't be a good coach if your players don't let you -- you can't be an effective coach. Everything starts with them, their ability to buy in, their ability to execute the things.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"As a staff, we're grateful. We talk about it every day. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be here. So it's on them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"The first question is part of life, like any situation you're in is going to help you for the next situation. So we should be able to take everything that we learned as a team, as an organization, last year, this year, so every experience should help you prepare for that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"As far as blocking out the noise, at the end of the day we're the most vulnerable in this. So we have to remain that. We have to remain with a sense of urgency. We have to have an understanding of our environment. We have to know that we're just as vulnerable as anybody else in this situation, and how we handle that will determine our fate.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, not at all. I think coaching is understanding that you can't win without the players. I don't care. I just want to win. I want to do it with good people, and we have an opportunity to do that. There's four rounds left in this fight, and however long it takes, whatever it takes, we'll see how it goes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"No. No, I think that's a rather passive way to look at things. I think at the end of the day, we have to continue to do what we do. Kristaps has gotten better from yesterday to today. He's fighting like hell to play. But it's going to be up to us to protect him and to make sure that it's in the best interest for him as a player and as a person.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Going into what's best for a player and a person has nothing to do with where we're at from a basketball standpoint.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, saying that diminishes the other great locker rooms that you've been in. I think everybody in that locker room would say they've been a part of other good locker rooms.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think a lot of it has to do with timing, but I think at the end of the day we're in a situation right now where everybody is on the same page, that winning is the most important thing, and that we're going to do whatever it takes for however long it takes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"We just have to remain in that mindset that it's everybody's responsibility to impact winning. As long as we stay there, we have an opportunity, we've got a chance.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,So I think it's focusing on that is what you've got to be grateful for.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Just building retention and learning how to understand the why and building an awareness to your environment. You can't make decisions and eliminate emotion if you don't have the facts and you don't have an understanding of your environment and what's going on.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just really trying to put yourself in a situation -- how can we get away from the emotion of your environment and how can you get to the tactical, the facts, the truth of what's going on so that you can adjust accordingly.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"It comes down to just being mature about it. You're in a very high-intensity, very high emotional state in this environment, playing in the Finals. Got a lot of people looking at you, a lot of eyes on you. But all you've got to do is just tune that out, focus on what you can control, how much energy you put in, how much effort you're going to put in, how much you're talking, how much you care about the situation.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"I kind of forget how big the nation really is.

It just makes you kind of walk with a certain light.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding the mistakes that we've made. Understanding what we did, understanding what we need to do in those moments and just understanding what each and every one of us are thinking.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"It was a lot of film. It was a lot of recognition. It was a lot of just talking, understanding we're trying to be on the same page. This is our first NBA Finals for a lot of us, and it's just making sure that we are together.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's going to be the whole world looking at you, the whole world talking bad on us, no matter where you look, no matter if it's on your phone, billboards or just talking to someone down the street. It's just trying to be able to understand that we've all got each other's backs. We're all learning from one another. We're learning from the situation, and we're trying to become better people and better players.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding where you are. We're down 3-0. But just because we're down 3-0, it's not finished. It's only going to come down to us putting all we can on the floor. Our heart, our soul. Just trying to come out and win little battles because that's what's going to get us the game, winning the 5050 balls, winning the rebounding game, winning the transition game and then just trying to stop them from what they're trying to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We're trying to make them play into our game, but we're trying to understand what our game is because we're not on the same page.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, we can't sit here and be like, the ref did this, the ref did that. We can't control that. What we can control is the positions that we're putting ourselves in to get those fouls, understanding that if we're talking and we're getting mad at the referees, they're going to end up -- they're going to get the last laugh.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We've got to be able to just be mature, be able to move on from whatever play, whatever call they're going to make on the floor because we're not able to control that. What we're able to do is focus on our reaction to those calls.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, overall I think in sports when it comes to competing you always have to believe in yourself, and that's what we do, too.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Even before the Playoffs, I think a lot of people didn't believe we could be here. We stayed together as a team at any time. Obviously, it's not ideal. It's not where we wanted to be, but this is also a great learning process for everybody involved.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"But overall in sports you keep competing no matter what, so you just approach it in the right way. Our backs are against the wall, obviously, being down 3-0, but we still have to continue to just play hard and believe in ourselves.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think our fans have been great all season long, but obviously yesterday, especially when we had the early run at the beginning of the game. They were loud, and then when we made the comeback from 20 points, they always supported us. They're always here for us, and obviously we wanted to take advantage of the home court yesterday. So that's something we have to do tomorrow.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"No, I love everybody on this team, coaching staff, everybody around the Mavs organization. I've been here for a long time now.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"We have practices. We analyze tape. We try to see what we have to do better, obviously, and then outside of that, just try to get my mind off a little bit, try to relax and then come back and focus my mind.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"I wouldn't necessarily say easier, but obviously when your back is against the wall, you can play a little bit more loose and just go out there and fight. You have nothing to lose.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"But overall I think the pressure remains the same at all times. You just want to win as a team no matter what. It doesn't matter if it's 0-0, whatever. We just still got to continue focusing on what we have to do, and also when we watch tape and analyze what we did, learn from it, also for future purposes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Well, that's a result of how the game goes. I think we just have to create better spacing for Luka and Kyrie to operate and get the right guys involved, and that will also give us better percentages.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,MAXI KLEBER,"Also, Boston is playing a little bit different in this series than they have before, a lot of switching, stuff like that. But it's good for us to just analyze and keep improving on what we want to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I thought Exum did great. We probably looked back at it, we could have probably got him in there a little bit more, but we went with the other guys. We were looking for someone to be able to knock down an open shot. We had good looks that just didn't go down for us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I thought Exum's pace, his ability to get the ball into the paint for those three minutes was good. So hopefully we can get him in the game in Game 4.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think we played 11 yesterday. Everybody is on deck. Everybody has to be ready to play. No lineup changes here today. But we'll see what tomorrow brings.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think the history is there for us to learn from, when you look at great players and the struggles. You look at MJ and the struggles that he had against Detroit. You look at some Magic Johnson struggles. You look at LeBron's first time around.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"It's there to learn from. But as the great ones, they use that going into the next season or the next couple seasons to try to get back there because now they understand experience is a big thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,I think you talk about playing Game 4. That's it.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I thought yesterday we got off to a really good start, and hopefully we can do that again tomorrow. You look at the end of quarters, the end of the first in Game 2 and also here in Game 3, we have to be better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Again, just taking one possession at a time, controlling what you can control, your effort and energy, and just winning the minutes when you're out there. That's all we've talked about today, and that's what we'll talk about tomorrow.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I think Luka is doing -- in this playoff series, when you talk about from the Clippers to today, his defense has improved. But when you look at being involved in every pick-and-roll, there's going to be mistakes that take place. That's just the game of basketball. We've just got to limit those mistakes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But he is involved in every possession. That's what the Celtics are very good at doing, is making sure when they go hunting, they get the guy that they want. And so for us, we've got to do a better job of protecting Luka.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,It was just film.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Both offense and defense. The good things that we did, and then also the things that we've got to improve on.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK JONES JR,It was just watching film. We got to see our mistakes and broke it down a little bit for us so we can get ready for Game 4.,,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK JONES JR,"We believe in each other. We never stop believing in each other. That's just how we are. We trust each other. We've been through a lot. We've been down 30, come back, take a 10-point lead and possibly have lost that game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DERRICK JONES JR,"But we've been through a lot. We've fought as a team, and we're going to keep fighting as a team no matter what.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I've had to deal with a ton of loss in my life, just watching people that I love kind of leave this earth, and that was difficult to deal with as a young person.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So just I think all in all, just learned how to not put so much pressure on myself, put things in perspective, and understand that I'm not alone.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just appreciating the gifts that I've had to earn and work for and built.

MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, very special to watch from afar, but also as a competitor, as a hooper, to be experiencing it at this level, it's an incredible teacher for me.

MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"So getting over this hump is something that's been on my mind for a while, watching them, just like everyone has been watching Boston the whole entire year, be the best team in the league. We obviously knew we would have our challenges, but this is what helps us grow.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Going out there and competing with the best of the best, competing with Jrue and Jaylen and JT and seeing their ability to cover up some of their mistakes or trust each other to make the right plays on the defensive end has shown me what I have to continue to work on and also learn to how to think the game in a better way.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm going against the best of the best, and this is what I've always dreamt of. Whether we win or lose, it's the growth that I look at and how I can continue to be a better leader for my teammates.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,It's been great because we're learning about each other in these moments and what we're made of and what we have to do to be great at this level.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of first-timers on this stage. I've said it over the past week or so, just it's a new space for me, too, just being with these guys and being tested at this level, being challenged at this level.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"My first Finals, although I was injured, I lost. You know, 2016, although we like to bring it up, was one of the toughest series you'll probably ever see in basketball in general.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't know if those records are just going to be so easy for someone just to look at and be like, yeah, we're able to do it, too. But that belief that you can win a series and win it together.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But yeah, my message to him is he's not alone in this. He's played as best as he can despite the circumstances, just injuries and stuff. He's been giving it his all. It's not all on him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Being under the microscope in this business is a lot different for me now than probably four years ago, five years ago, because I'm able to put the big picture of life in perspective and also the game in perspective. It comes easier.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Then also I think the social media, sociopathic behavior. You know, your inner voice is not clear anymore when you're downloading other voices and other opinions. That can become hard.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,Any little thing that you give your energy to can be a distraction that doesn't positively reinforce what you're trying to accomplish.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,So I think we're learning that about each other right now from not only us as players but the coaching staff and everybody that's been part of this journey thus far. No one picked us to be in this position. No one anticipated us to be here.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"There may be a few people in this crowd right here that had an idea, but we've pretty much broken the mold of what we're capable of doing, and I think we're trending in the right direction.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"We have some positives going on. It obviously sucks horrendously that we're not at least competitive in this series right now three games in, but it's also about getting the experience and learning through these things and also learning more about yourself.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I've taken the brunt of the responsibility because these guys in this locker room, it is their first time. So being in this position, I do feel like a lot of it is on me.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"A lot of my teammates would say, no, it's not just you, which I appreciate, but this is also part of my journey, and the story doesn't end here, win or loss.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm just appreciative that we can get another chance to extend our season tomorrow and just leave it all out there. It's all about a pride thing now, and just putting our best foot forward.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Oh, man. Yeah. Man, I haven't even given that much thought, to be honest with you. This has been the longest season I've played in awhile. It's been six years.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,So I'm looking at the big picture in a way that I probably was not ready to look at in my early 20s or late 20s.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"The way technology is today, the way I take care of my body every day and the way I have the opportunity to learn more about my body as I get into my 30s, I'm appreciating.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"My mind continues to get sharper. My physical tools are obviously naturally going to deteriorate, which I can appreciate, too. So adding new skill sets or adding new nuances to my game where I can be successful at this level, especially going against a more athletic league or a faster league, and you've got me over here speaking like I'm 38 already.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But at 32 right now, I just feel like the sky's the limit. I have an opportunity to be on a special team that can be one of the teams that dominates in this era. That's what I've been trying to figure out the past few years, of how to be on a great team, be in an organization where I'm trusted, and also we're able to succeed and fail together, and doing it in a way where we still have each other's backs, and no one is giving up on the dream or the goal.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Our goal is still to win a championship. That's been No. 1. For me, that's why I play basketball every year is just to be able to continue to get better but also to compete for championships.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"If I'm not doing that at 33 or 34 or 35, then we probably can revisit this. But I think right now, I feel like we're trending in the right direction, and especially this organization led by Nico and J-Kidd and our new ownership group. They have a lot of trust in us, which I appreciate, which makes my decision making on what my future looks like a lot easier.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think just looking back at that first year of both of them playing together Jayson's rookie year, just remember two very extremely talented guys that right away had an impact on the team that year after losing Gordon, and those guys just taking up on the challenge.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I feel like that year we started the season, we lost the first two and then we won like 15, 16 straight, and they were a big part of that. So right away, I just saw the potential there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"To be at this point right now, this is what we expected. I know it doesn't always work that way. But once you get to know those two guys, the type of people that they are, their drive, they want to be great, and I just -- I saw this for them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"I mean, since then, there's been a lot. They came in trying to figure things out, and just offensively they've grown, defensively.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"But more to me, it's been the leadership, being more vocal with our group, also understanding that there's more than just playing basketball. There's a whole other element, preparation, consistency. That's where I've seen their growth. That's paying big dividends for them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think it's pretty easy because what we're focusing on is on our day-to-day, and today we had a good film session before coming here. We're going to practice right after this. It's really just focusing on the work.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,We've continued to do this. We've been doing this all season. This is just the point of the season that we're at.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,We're not allowing ourselves to think ahead. We're just trying to lock in on what we have to do. The job is not done yet.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"So I don't really -- I guess I've heard it before. But basketball is a team sport. It's a team sport. When you are fortunate enough to play for the Boston Celtics, you quickly realize that it's more than just the team that you're representing and the things that you're trying to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"For me, being in this opportunity, I give the glory to the Lord because he's put me in this position, and for me, I know that it's more than me. We have a lot of fans. We have a lot of people. They have been waiting for this opportunity, for these moments. We've been through a lot of adversity as a team these past few years.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,AL HORFORD,"To be at the cusp of doing this, it's something special.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,I would say the turnovers. To have no turnovers is always a good thing. That means that we're getting some good possessions and not giving the other team the ball.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's seeing the success of the team. I think you see how we celebrate each other. Somebody gets a big dunk or a big three, when somebody gets a big stop, that really brings energy not only to me but I feel like to everybody.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Day before Game 4, up 3-0, I feel like we celebrate each other. Even through the downs, we do our best to pick each other up. I think we've done that as a team and will continue to do it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, that we lock in the best we can, that we do the best to really go out there and execute the game plan and try to get stops. That really gives us the best chance to win games.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nerves, for sure. You feel like the close-out game is the hardest game to win. You really just want to go out there and do your best, if it's make the right plays, if it's knock down shots, execute the game plan.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You feel like of everything in the season, this is the game you've got to do it. I feel like we'll have that same kind of mentality to where we try to come out relaxed, not too excited, but execute the best we can.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,It's the final game of the season.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't ask her, but we've had conversations. Just watching games or even while I watched her play soccer. I would ask her certain things about how she felt, why she played the way she played or whatever it was.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think for the most part, having just an understanding and having a partner that helps me kind of get calm in situations that can help me be in position to win on the court.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is I don't think any of us care about it. I think we all really want to win that Larry O'Brien Trophy. Whatever accolades come with that come with it, but I think the big picture is what everybody is focused on.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not even a little bit. I got two brothers in the league, so if I'm really going to be chippy or something, why wouldn't I be chippy with them? Everybody in Milwaukee, I have love for them. I love them because of what we've been through and what we accomplished as a team. We became very, very close.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But no, I know that this is a business, and they feel like they did what was best for their organization.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's exciting. We're in a great spot, but we're really just focused on the next game and taking it day by day. The job is not done yet, so still a lot of work to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's important. It's really important. You've got to stay disciplined, got to stay in your routines, got to be good in practice. Then all that together leads into the game and execution.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,We're just trying to be as disciplined and as consistent as possible.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"I mean, Al is just a true professional. He's one of the best teammates I've ever had. He's seen a lot in this league. He's a guy you can lean on for advice. He's seen everything you can see.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"But really want to get this one for him. It's like the one thing that he just hasn't been able to get yet in his career, and it'll be pretty special if we can do it for him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he's always poking his head in. I'd say he's pretty in tune with what's going on. He's at every practice. I'm sure he's talking to the coaches, giving advice every now and then.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"He's just a good guy to have around. He provides good advice, and obviously another guy who's been through a lot and seen a lot of things in this league. It's good to have him around.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he gave me a chance in this league. I was undrafted. I didn't really know what was going to come on draft night, and he called me and gave me a shot with a two-way, and I just tried to make the most of it. Obviously I got converted up to the big leagues.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,It's hard to thank him enough for giving me a chance.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's good. I think he has a unique relationship with everybody. I think he's good at finding one or two things to talk about with each guy on a daily basis that's just to keep the humanity in this professional world.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"He's a great human. He really truly cares about you as a person first more so than as a player, which is awesome.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he deserves a lot of credit for it. He constantly keeps us in check, tries to keep us right where we need to be, not too high, not too low, but right in the sweet spot. He's done a great job of that this year.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,SAM HAUSER,"Obviously we have a great lead in this series, but like I said before, the job is not done, and he's definitely kept us in check knowing that we still have a lot to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,My dad is here. It was great to have him here supporting. It's great.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It feels fine. You've got to be able to express your feelings. It's amazing just to be here, be a part of something that a lot of guys never really been able to play in.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,Just embracing it and try and do the best we can.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think it's difficult playing against everybody in general. But specifically Boston, 1 through 5, they all can guard. Even when you're trying to find weaknesses in their defense, they always come back or they always have a back line of defense that helped that guy out.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"They don't really do a great job of just playing individual defense. They do a great job playing team defense, which goes a long way and which everybody can see.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think the biggest adjustment will be being able to build on that fourth quarter that we had yesterday. Played desperate, played well. Everybody was defending, keeping their man in front of them, contesting every shot, and rebounding, making sure they didn't get any offensive rebounds.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"If we can build off on that moving forward, I think we give ourselves a great opportunity.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I mean, Al has been the same way since we've been in Atlanta. Always solid. Always solid, never doing too much, never getting out of sync, keeping everybody together, an anchor on defense, talking on defense, which gives the guards amazing confidence to guard their man, knowing that he's in that back line.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"Just him being able to make it this far and be in this position, very, very happy to see him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It's part of their defense. Like I said, it's not an individual defense, it's a team defense, and they take pride in it. They're one of the best at it, if not the best at it. It's not really him on an island picking up Luka and Ky. He has a really solid back line behind him making sure he's confident out there in front of those guys. Yeah, that's probably the reason.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,It was good. I think it's important to be able to look at what we didn't do right and learn from that and just make sure we're ready.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I just think there's been certain things that we've done continuously in games that we probably should have made adjustments on. But overall we always watch film and it's always an open discussion. And I think that's what's cool with Coach, is he sees both sides of us and is able to talk it out with the players.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"When you're in the game, I'm not really studying every single foul he commits. At the end of the day it's --",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"It's unfortunate. It's a hard position to be put into. But at the end of the day, he's doing it for a reason, and it's because he wants to win the game. He's a competitive guy, so I'm not holding my head a certain way. I know he wants to win, and he's a very competitive leader, and he's the leader of our team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, it's obviously challenging. The refs are -- as frustrating as they can be sometimes, they're also the same as us, they have emotions, they change the way -- the same way players get frustrated, they can get frustrated.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"But obviously I think it can change the game a little bit, but I think that's what's helped our team is when we've been at our best, we don't let it hurt us. We kind of use it, use that energy and shift it to us. We kind of let certain things change the way the game goes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"It can be challenging for players for sure, but I really back our group, and we have a group of guys that I know I'll go to battle with all the time.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"No matter what the energy is, I always feel like we can always turn it around.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,Leave it all out on the floor. That's what we need to do.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they're a big three-point team. That's one of their biggest focuses. They're a great shooting team. I mean, it's just part of the game, and it's like, you're saying from like a defensive point of view --",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"I think our team, we've done great defensively, and I think we do have a great defensive team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously they've hit some tough shots, but overall I think we have played good defense. But going into the game, it's hard to say limit them to a certain number, but obviously we want to limit them to under whatever their averages were.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"And obviously we know they're a big three-point team, and just like us, we're a big corner three-point team, and they've done a good job of taking that away.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,Mindset going into Game 4 is win. Feelings right now is to be better than the last.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was tough because we fought our way back, so we fought so hard to get all the way back. The guys that were out there on the floor, they gave it all they got. A lot of guys that came back to the locker room after the game was exhausted. Just seeing how hard they fought, it was just tough to see how the outcome was for it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"But it's motivation going into the next game, for sure.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmmm... I would say it's a little bit of both. But I would say we stay motivated and we just focus on the next game at hand, the most important game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just shows how desperate we were playing. It was something that I saw when it came to just like guys coming into the timeout. It was just a lot of motivation. Everybody was pulling each other in, trying to stay encouraged. Didn't matter what was going on, didn't matter how the fans were.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It didn't matter what was going on just like on the outside, everything on the inside is what was all falling into place together, in my opinion.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"From everything that I seen, everybody was lifting each other up. D Live, he was one of the most vocal guys out there with Kyrie. Whenever Luka went down after his sixth foul, everybody pulled together, just tried to make one final push. The vibe around the team was just leave it all out there on the floor. Whatever happens in the end happens.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,We just have to find ways to just implement that 20-2 run to just like our game plan in general from start to finish.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,I can't really just pinpoint on why it doesn't happen at the beginning of the games. For sure it's an adjustment that we can make to be able to come out and do it in the next one.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,It's real encouraging. We want to be able to just survive and advance. It's the last series of the season. Don't nobody want to ever be in this position.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,But we just have to really just take our time.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, yeah, for sure. We always want to help the main two guys when it comes to just scoring. Defensively I feel like we're doing our job. It just comes all down to just defense wins games.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,DANIEL GAFFORD,"We just have to, like I said, just stay motivated when it comes to certain parts of the game. Not trying to force everything, just kind of like letting the game come to us in certain areas.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, first, I think I just look at how long the guys have been in the paint, the low man. If it's time -- if it's like two seconds, he's going to go out. I think that's the moment to attack. Then I just try to read the game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"If he comes, there's going to be a lob open to the corner. If he doesn't, I just try to take the layup.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, yeah. At some point, yeah. I just really want to win. Sometimes I don't show it the right way, but at the end of the day, I really want to win. I've got to do a better job showing it a different way.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,Go back to playing fun. We talk about how we come back from 20 points in the fourth quarter in the Finals. We were having fun. We were defending. We were running. Our pace was great. Just taking good shots.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Just got to go away, because at the end of the day refs are going to have the last word. So just got to go away from that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I didn't really study the first Finals of some people. Obviously, they were great players. Obviously, there's the story of MJ against Detroit. That was a big thing. I think he just learned from it. It's a great experience. You've got to go through lows first to go on top. I think that's great experience.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Just like we did before. I always talk in the regular season, there was a time we were at our very low. I think we lost five, six in a row, and from there we just went up. I think we went 17-2 to get in the Playoffs.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I know that's the regular season, but it was the kind of point we all came together, and the chemistry from there went to the top. We've just got to believe. We talk about it in the locker room. I know we can do it, and we're going to believe until the end.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they have great players. Basically, all five players that are on the floor, they can really score. They can shoot.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Our strategy was just trying to make them drive more and then be on the wheel, on the rotations. I think I have to do a better job on that, just keeping in front.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Oh, definitely, a lot of holes, I think, still. I'm 25. I've got a lot of things to learn. This is my first NBA Finals, so I'm going to learn from it, for sure.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"But we're not in the offseason yet. They've still got to win one more game. Like I said, we're going to believe until the end.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"Just keeping the team together. Like I said, we have great guys. We all know what we came here to do. Obviously, we're going against the best team in the NBA, but we're going to believe. It's a first for us, but we're going to believe, and that's our motivation.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, last year, just falling short on your home floor, it definitely hurt. It was embarrassing, in my opinion.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like the team was relying on me. JT got hurt in Game 7 and I dropped the ball. To me, it was embarrassing. It drove me all summer, drove me crazy.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,I've never been a complainer to the refs. I don't think I've ever had a history -- I don't even know most of the refs by name.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"I do think having a relationship and talking to them to know what you're kind of seeing can have a benefit. But at this point, I think it's a distraction. You go out there and you play the game, and you take it out of the referees' hands.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Joe has been great. Just being in this position last year, just being in the interim role was tough. Even though we weren't making any excuses, but him inheriting that position, it was a little bit more of uncertainty about what we were doing going forward. It wasn't necessarily his staff.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Now I feel like he's gotten his feet under him a little bit more, even the start of this year. He's been excellent. He's been organized. He seems like he's been a lot more comfortable, and it's showed in our team. Joe's mentality is fantastic. Even today, one of my favorite quotes he said today, he was like, there's no such thing as a foul in a war. Either you survive or you don't. Just that resonates with me because I like stuff like that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's really just all mentality, mentally just your will, your focus, your perseverance, your ability to overcome self. I think that's what I worked on the most.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"In moments of embarrassment, in moments of coming up short, falling short is where the most growth takes place. Last year to end the season the way we did, I really attacked the summer.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. You spend so much time and you go through so many things, the ups, the downs, the highs and the lows, and it creates that. Those memories are memories that we're going to forever have together. So those are things that you're always going to carry with you.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"To be able to be in this moment, to potentially seal our first championship, I think that's awesome.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Damn, that's a good question. My love for the game has definitely changed and evolved. There's been ups and downs, for sure. But one thing that I've always loved is the ability to have a platform and to be able to be a role model for others.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"There's younger kids watching, maybe watching this interview right now, that maybe aspire to get to the Finals or the NBA or to just be the best versions of themselves. It's going to be a journey. Just know when those moments of adversity come, just never let nothing break your spirit, because I didn't, and I won't.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that top to bottom, we trust everybody, and we just compete at a high level. Obviously they are great players, and it's a challenge but just consistently being in the right position and just competing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Jrue is literally everywhere. It's unreal. I don't know how he does it. Try to learn as much as I can from him, and he's just -- just when you think you've got an opening, like he's just -- he's unreal.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a guy that just wants to learn. Some of the drills he does is just a little unconventional, I think, but like just wants to learn and wants to grow. And then every year he's been in the league, he's gotten so much better. That's just a credit to his mindset and the work he puts in.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"So being his teammate has been a lot of fun. I've learned so much from him, and he just continues to push me and the rest of us to continue to improve and want to get better.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, Joe is consistent the whole time. I mean, he's probably so happy that it happened like that so he can just continue to tell us that laughter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"But he just stays consistent. He just makes the right calls, and we just trust him completely. So, yeah, it seemed pretty true today.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"He's a sicko, so probably. Laughter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Sam has been doing it all year. He gets attacked nearly every time he checks into the game, and we've just got a lot of faith and confidence in him. He just does what he needs to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"But big shout out to X. To not be in the rotation but to stay locked in and he gives us big-time minutes, plus nine, and he just does a little bit of everything out there. Then he guarded his ass off and hit a big shot and rebounds, and he just did a little bit of everything for us. Credit to him. Great, great teammate, great guy, and he was big for us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, obviously the strength of this team is the team. But we understand that JB and JT, they are our guys, and they are going to make big plays and they are going to make the right play. I think that's the most important part is just we trust them to make the right play every time down the court, and they are facing literally every coverage known to man. They just make the right play no matter what time is on the clock, and we just trust them so much.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think experience always helps. We have a lot of guys that have been in close games and big games, and so I just don't think we panic probably as much as we have in the past. We just try to stay calm and do what we need to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, who knows if we would have lost these games in the past, but we just know we've got so many different ways to win games and trust that we can find the answer and just do whatever it takes to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"It's big time. He just stays right here, competes on the defensive end like always. And offensively he can take nine shots, he can take one shot. Like he doesn't care. And just does whatever it takes for us to win. So just having him on the team is just a big blessing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think just we had some turnovers, which allowed them to get out in transition. And just a couple of things that we've been doing really well, we kind of just let go of the rope for however many minutes that was. It seemed like, what, two minutes, they cut it to two, three or something.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"It happened quick, and we just settled back down. Understand it's a game of runs, and we just trust what we do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,Obviously the closer you are to winning that's his go-to. That was obviously said.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"But just understand that we need to play better. The close-out games are never easy, and close-out games in the Finals is probably ten-times of that. So learn a lot from what we did well, what we need to do and just understand we're going to have to play even better for the next game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,Big-time. Big-time shots. Just a guy that he wanted the ball and was able to get to his spot and rise up and knock it down.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"He makes tough shots, and he's just a special player.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Demanded, whoa.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I think Joe is a basketball genius. So whatever he says, I'm going to try to just do it to my highest capabilities.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, we just try to make the right basketball play every time down the court, whether that's a three, but just trying to have the right spacing and just make the right basketball play.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"It's not like we need to take however many threes. I think we just can win in so many different ways, and with our spacing and guys that can shoot on the court, we can just do so much.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Just you know showing the emotions of the game. Two guys that was excited, tired, that you know, after the game, we just -- we're not necessarily saying like one more or anything like that. We are just saying, however long it takes. Nobody is relaxed. Nobody is satisfied. Just at that moment, you know, just told him I was proud of him and he said the same thing that we've got to keep fighting. We can't relax. And that was basically the conversation.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Honestly, not too difficult from the standpoint of last year we were down 0-3 in the Conference Finals, and we really felt like we were going to come back. We almost did. You know, we were a sprained ankle away from having like a real shot.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So, you know, we are not relaxing or anything like that. You know, not even focusing on winning or Friday or whatever. However long it takes, that's our motto. However long it takes, that's what it's going to take, and nobody is not trying to relax at all.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"That's a great question. I would say that life is about roller coasters, right. The game of basketball and life and whatever your occupation is, right, we all go through ups and downs.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"In the toughest moments, that's when your true character comes out and essentially being the same person all the time, that's what I try to do, in the best of times and in the worst of times. That's what I'm going to try to instill in him. You've got to be the same person. You've got to be a stand-up guy through thick and thin.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, they came out swinging. That was to be expected. They were at home, and their crowd was behind them. This is obviously a big game. So we expected their first punch. You know, it's just in that moment that Jrue kind of brought us together and just clapped his hands like, Yo, we got to wake up, we got to lock in. We got to get some stops. Because at that point, they had like 25 points. In the last five, six minutes, we held them to like five or six points.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"But to start the quarter, we weren't getting any stops. You know, we are not going to win a game like that. We just have to reset and lock back in at that moment.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Not really trying to look too much into it. The game of basketball is about runs, and this is at the highest level. You know, it's the best team in the West at this point. They are going to make shots. They are going to go on a run, and it's just all about how do you respond.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, we talk about it all the time. 20-point leads, none that have is ever safe. It's never time to relax. You never want to give up a 20-point lead. Obviously we wish we would have got some better shots, took care of the ball. But things happen. It's never going to go how you expect it, and we talk about that all the time. But if you want to be a champion, you have to be resilient in those moments, and we showed that tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Joe does a great job of showing us clips and things from different sports, right. He's a big UFC fan. And you know, showing us fights of people that -- I don't know like the terminology of UFC, but put them in a chokehold and s--- like they about to tap out. You just see the guy or the woman who is winning relaxing because they feel like they are about to win, and then, you know, you give the other person life.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Just trying to translate that to the game of basketball that, you know, the closer you are to winning, the closer they are to surviving. Basically just trying to remind us in the group that we've still got a long way to go. We still have to play the right way. We've still got to win. They are not going to quit, and we should expect the best from them from here on out.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"You just alluded to it that we've been in that situation. We've been in a close game where we were up, and we almost went up 3-1, and then they tied it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"And experience is the best teacher. We learned from our mistakes. We learned from a team at the time that was better than us, that had been there and been over that hump and mentally tougher at the time.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"We've grown from that, we really have. It was on display tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I've got to watch the film, but that was excellent basketball we played to start the third, especially on the offensive end. I don't know how many possessions in a row that we got a great shot. We made most of them. We might have missed a few.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"But the way that we started the third quarter was incredible. You know, everybody else on that court, the mindset we came out to start the third in our execution, we did a hell of a job in the start of the third quarter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't know if it's at cut and dry as we need to shoot a lot of threes, but with the group that we have and playing to our strengths, being able to beat guys off the dribble, and the luxury that we have is, you know, with our starting five, whether it's KP or Al, everybody can space the floor and shoot.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So it just puts their 5-man in a tough position. 5-men are known to usually help at the rim. But if we have guys that can attack you off the dribble and get all the way to the rim, you want to help. But we've got 40 percent three-point shooters all around the paint.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JAYSON TATUM,"So it's just all about making the right reads. We're never like, we need to shoot 40 threes a night. But if we play to our strength and space how we're supposed to, it just finds the right person, and we don't turn down any great shots.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, it's tough to lose him. Obviously praying for Karen, Jonnie, Ryan, the rest of their family.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"My junior year in college, wasn't living up to anyone's standards. I got a call. It's Jerry. A lot of expletives, but he basically told me I was an F-up and had the opportunity to be great at something. Just let me have it for like 10, 15 minutes. I thought it was one of the most impactful phone calls that I had really in my life.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Stayed at his house once and overslept for UCLA open gym. Went down for breakfast and got another ass chewing because I wasn't being competitive enough.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"The thing I remember about him is he had a tough way of showing that he loved you, but he was super, super competitive and he really, really cared about you. He showed it in a way that kind of spoke to my language.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,He'll be missed and praying for the family.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, just day to day. Just the medical team and the staff just decided that it wasn't what's best for him to go tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, obviously you saw in the first two games his rim protection, his ability to space the floor. But I think the thing that prepared us this year is our depth. It just looks different.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"The guys ready to step in can do different things and have a positive impact, which they've done. So we just have to rely on that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, it's tough. I've appreciated just his approach. Throughout the whole Playoffs, like I said, he's never missed any meeting, he's always been out there, done everything he can to play. Sometimes it's an unfortunate situation. It's nothing that he can do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Definitely feel for him, but appreciate kind of where he's at. I trust that he'll do everything he can to get ready for the next game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"KP, you're not playing. He didn't look right. That was it. I wasn't involved in it. Like you said, it was out of his hands, up to the medical team. They watched him kind of go through some testing and they said it didn't feel right, so you're not playing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Get ready for tomorrow and hopefully the next day.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I did.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"A little bit everywhere. When you're not that good, they just throw you around in a bunch of different places to see where you stick.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"A lot of stuff. I think just the beauty of the game, the flow of the game. I think it's different. Soccer is much different than the game of basketball. A basketball star is only defined by scoring.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Soccer, you really have to pay attention to the game to recognize the impact each individual player is doing, because points are at a premium. Each guy in the right position has a direct impact on the guy in the next position.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So greatness, you have to pay attention and look for it, whereas in basketball you can look at a stat sheet and say, oh, it must've been this guy that have played really well.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So really the depths to which you have to go to understand the greatness and the complexity, the beauty and the connectivity that goes into playing the game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,I wasn't out there. I have no idea.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's the same steady messaging. Also you want to give them the best preparation you can as far as what the sub pattern might be and what the ifthen scenarios will be. So you go over a couple of those with them, but for the most part it's the work those guys have been doing with them leading up to this point and conversations with their individual coaches, which have gone very well. I just trust the work they put in.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the questions have allowed me to fight that. I don't think I've gone out of my way to do it. You guys have asked really good questions based on that. I've been able to take the question you guys ask and give my perspective on it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think at the end of the day, it's about our team and it's about putting the guys in the best possible position to succeed and have an understanding that our guys are going out there and doing everything they can as a team, and why that's so important to long-term success. I think that's what we're trying to achieve as an organization.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It doesn't happen unless the players decide to do it, and they're doing it. You can't let that go unnoticed.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Like if you've ever been in a fight with someone and you think you're about to beat 'em, you usually get sucker punched. The closer you are to beating them up, the closer you are to losing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Closer you think you're going to submit someone, is usually when you get submitted.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"There's a lot of them. Usually every single fight. I think it was UFC 302, guy gets hits in the nuts, complains to the ref, complains to the referee, gets distracted, he gets choked out the next round. He lost his focus.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"You see Alex Pereira, gets hits in the nuts, looks at the referee, knocks the guy out five seconds later.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,So it's the approach to what happens to you and how you handle it. But the closer you think you are to beating someone is the closer you are to getting your ass kicked.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Tonight I expect the best out of Dallas, and we got to get ready for a fight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, you were going to expect a run from them because they had a 19-point quarter. And just by the type of shots they take alone, you knew they were going to make some kind of run. Some of those came at the expense of our offense. I thought we missed a couple reads that changed coverages and they changed matchups on like three or four straight possessions and we missed the read to get the right shot.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I would say probably 60 percent of the shots that we took in that stretch we have to get better, and 40 percent I was okay with. We just missed them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Our one-shot defense and our ability to get back to the game plan, they put a ton of pressure on your defensive game plan throughout, and you've just got to stick with the discipline of it. So we were able to do that and make plays down the stretch.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Nothing. Our first half points per shot was 1.23. So I thought we getting really good looks. They just weren't falling. You just have to stick with it over the course of the entire game. I thought in the third quarter, we found the right spacing and frequency, and we made the right reads six times and that got us those shots and they were able to fall.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's where the second stretch of that fourth quarter, we missed some of those reads, and they were able to come back into the game. Those guys' ability to know that what shots they were taking, and continue to take the right ones over and over again.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"He played in the Western Conference for three or four years, and so he's played against the Mavs. And so he's had that experience. Memphis has used a similar game plan, so he was used to that. I thought with that comfort level of playing against those guys for so long, he was going to be able to execute the things that we needed to execute.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so I thought he did a great job in our switching and did a great job in our screening, getting into our spacing. And that's what we talk about with those guys, is regardless of who is in, who is out, I trust the next man up because of the work they put in and the staff that prepares them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, we got asked that question a lot because it was new. Anytime you're developing a new philosophy or a new style, it just takes time for understanding and execution.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So credit to the guys where we decided how we are going to play, and we fight to do that. You know, but also just being flexible in that. So we don't want to just settle for those. I think our guys have done a good job fighting for the right shot based on what the defense was giving us. We were able to get some of those in the third quarter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think it says a lot about them. The guys understand the game. They understand why we do what we do, and they work to execute it as best as they can.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,I would say both teams have a lot of talent. So I think you have to have talent to get to this spot. That's a given if you want to make it this far.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"But our guys have a great basketball IQ and have a great understanding of are we playing the right way, taking the right shots and giving up the right shot. They know exactly when we are not doing that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So they have an innate ability to control the runs of the game with the philosophy that we have and execute the things. And so it's just constant building awareness, are we getting the right shots, are we giving up the right shots and are we winning the transitions. The guys do a great job of working towards understanding that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just what we talked about. Having an understanding of like we know teams are going to make runs can we manage those. And we know why we make runs, and we know why other teams make a run on us.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So you just have to constantly problem solve throughout the game. You have to ask yourself why every single possession, why did that happen? Why did this happen? Was this what we talked about? Was it not? And the guys, they fight for that because of their basketball I",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"They spend a lot of time understanding that. And that's part of the game. They got out to a big lead, and I forgot what we were down, 13? So that's just part of the game. But it's understanding why. Why are we down 13? Is it effort? Is it execution? Is it things we can control? And once we answer those questions, we can move on to the next phase of the game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, how can I explain Jaylen? The guy just has a growth mindset. He just wants to get better. He yearns to get better. He's not afraid to face his weaknesses on the court.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So when you have that type of mindset, you're just going to be able to take on every situation that the game brings you. He puts himself in every single situation that he sees in a game. He uses six, seven, eight coaches a day, and every situation on both ends of the floor, he puts himself in that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't think he gets worn down. He looks pretty fresh out there. I think we could do a better be job of being intentional in the offense with the spacing at times, but I don't see him getting tired at all.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"We were trying to play fast, create advantages and create indecision. But we didn't create any indecision. When you miss the first read, it's not a lack of execution from the guys. It's not a lack of like trying to execute. It's if you miss the first read and you miss the first window, it's really hard to get that window back against a team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so, you know, that's what we were able to do in the third quarter. We found the first read, bang, right there, and we got it like six, seven, eight times in a row. If you miss that first one, it's a nightmare to get a second and third one, and that's when you end up taking a couple shots you don't want to take.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"It wasn't because they weren't trying to. We just missed it. They do a good job of changing up matchups and changing spacing and fluctuating it. So there's about eight possessions where we will definitely watch. But we have to do a better job of seeing the first read and when we don't, we have to find the second one faster.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just stick to the things that we've been doing. I mean, have an understanding. We were down 13. I expected that. We were down one at the half, and I expected that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,You have to expect the expected. You've got to understand we are just as vulnerable if not more vulnerable than they are. And we have to play that way.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"So as long as we have that mindset, and when you understand that you're vulnerable and your back's against the wall, you've got to fight. And so that's the mindset that we have to have.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Again, it's all about taking the right shots. It's all about taking what the defense gives you. They are playing a unique defense against us because they are one of the best teams in the league at protecting the rim, and they have two great rim protectors. So if you try to become stubborn, you put yourself in a disadvantaged situation at the other end of the floor.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Our defense starts with our offense. And so if we don't take the right shot, we can't guard them. And our team has the discipline to fight for the spacing and to fight to take the right shot, whatever that shot may be.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"Derrick has a green light to shoot the shots because his skill set is taking the shots that make sense. He can get into the paint and shoot the two-foot floater off there, he can shoot off the dribble threes, and he can shoot catch-and-shoot threes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I love the fact that he continues to play. His confidence never wavers based on the shots he takes, and you can always count on him to make the big ones.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We just got to make history. We got to go out there and we just got to play like our lives on the line. We got to make sure we're not giving up corner threes. The game plan is allowing them to get to the rim, allow them to take pull-up twos.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"So we're going to keep learning to do that, but we got to be able to rotate well, talk, communicate, know where the pass is going to go, know where we need to be.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We all know what it takes. We all know we got to put everything in our minds, our body and our soul into this game. We're watching film, we're talking to one another, we're trying to figure out what we need to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"They're a great team, so you got to give them that. They know how to score. They've been doing this for a long time. We just got to be able to step up, learn and be able to adapt.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"It really comes down to us just taking our foot off the gas. There were times in the game we allowed them to be comfortable, allowed them to walk into threes. That's what they're going to do. They're going to make the shots that they get, we're going to give them.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,We just can't take our foot off the gas. There were times in I'd say the third quarter and end of the second that we just allowed them to go on runs. We allowed them to be comfortable. We can't allow that to happen.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We have to be up in their grill the entire game, and not let our foot off the gas.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Next-man-up mentality. No matter if I foul out, Luka or Ky. It's the next-man-up mentality. No matter who is on the floor, what's going on in the game, we're all putting our heart and soul into trying to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like we did an amazing job throughout the whole game. Even when we slipped up, we were staying together, staying positive, doing whatever we could to try to win.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,We just got to be able to take care of the little things. The little details is what is going to cost us the game.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,I didn't think it was a foul. I don't think any of us did. Just you can't take back what the refs call. You can't take back that moment.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"So seeing him foul out, he putting his trust in us, his teammates, as I would do if I fouled out. Just because he fouls out doesn't mean we're all going to look down and be boo-hoo, we lost. We're going to keep our foot on the gas.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We were trying to do whatever we could to try to stay in the game and win. We come up short, but we're going to learn from our mistakes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"Us as bigs, we were trying to make more of an impact than we have the past two games. Trying to duck in, be all over the glass, no matter if it's defensive or offensive, try to go on a run. They were trying to pass off Porzingis' man a lot. Even with that, we were trying to put Al Horford in it, any other elephants, and try to get the mismatches, get the space and get the shots that we like.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"He came out, he was the head of the snake. I feel like he was leading us, making sure we had energy, making sure we were talking to each other, staying positive and then setting each other up. He was talking to us, saying what he needs from us, what we need from him.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,He's been a great leader. He had a great game today. I know he's going to have another one on Friday.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"He's a great defender. He's been in the league for a while. He understands the game. He understands the schemes, what they're trying to do, what we're trying to do.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"There were a couple times he got on the ball, he was moving his puppies. Got to tip your hat to that. Just because that happens -- just because you're adding a new person in doesn't mean anything.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"We were just trying to do what we do. Get out in pace, pass the ball, throw it ahead, get ahead, get to the rim. If not, get corner threes and move the ball around.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,That's a good question. There's a lot of them.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the adjustment is no different than the Indiana series. They didn't have him. They're used to not having him. The adjustment with Horford or Tillman, someone that they can go to. I think there's not a big adjustment.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,They just came out of a series without KP. We look for them to continue. Maybe somebody's minutes goes up.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"For us, understanding what KP does at the rim with the shot blocking or changing shots. So we have to be aggressive when we take the ball and understand their smalls are pretty good at blocking shots, too. We have to account for who is at the rim.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"It was just brought to my attention. I didn't even know. Talking to Mike and Doris from ABC, today was Game 6. Just to understand time flies by.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"But it was a surreal moment to be able to win the championship. To do it with that team, with Dirk being our leader, Jason Terry. They were asking, What did you think when the horn went off? I was like, We wanted to keep playing, but there was no one else to play.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,I think we're comfortable with P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with Maxi at the five.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Boston has done a great job in the sense of taking the vertical game away and living with the layup. When you look at our quarterbacks, Ky and Luka, getting to the rim, we have to take that and at some point, if we can make enough to see if they can make that change.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"If they don't, we can look at Maxi or P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with that. We've done that during the season.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I did not, unfortunately.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"That's a great question. Everybody. The game of basketball is about communication. For our guys, that's one of the things, as much as communicate, the next step is listen and be able to process what's being said.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"For us as a group, we've been a little bit slower with that. Hopefully we've made that adjustment and can be better with that tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I think talking about the last game, we put ourselves in a position on the road to win. That's all you can ask for.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,I haven't talked to Dirk here in the last week. He has FIBA obligations. He has tennis lessons and everything else smiling. He has more important things.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"We'll talk when we're at home and he's here hopefully for Game 3 or 4, just to get some advice of what he sees here as we go forward.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,But I haven't talked to him since the Minnesota series.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's I think what we talked about after the game, one possession at a time. We'll watch film tomorrow and get ready for Friday.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we were trying to find someone to come off the bench and give us a spark. It doesn't always have to be someone making a shot. I thought the guys that played tonight helped us get the lead or get back into the game.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"They called a foul. I was stuck. I had to challenge it, so ...",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Had to challenge because it was a close call. But the referee called it a foul. Got to move on, move forward.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"We missed some layups. We had some good looks. We missed some layups, some open threes. Again, we miss a three, Ky misses a pullup that we would take every time. It's a one-possession game. Unfortunately, we could just not get over the hump tonight.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he's definitely got a bull's-eye on his chest. He's got to be able to guard and understand that we're there to protect him and help him if he does get beat.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Again, he's carrying a load offensively. They are putting him in every pick-and-roll and iso. He's got to be able to play the game where he can rest on offense and let others carry the load.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I don't know if it was the Celtics. I think we just got -- we missed some bunnies tonight. Understanding that that's just part of the game, I think with fatigue, mentally and physically. We just missed some layups that we haven't missed here in the Playoffs.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,Give them credit they make it tough. They will wear on you as the game goes on. We got off to a good start. But I didn't see where they affected us in the sense of we missed some layups. That's just the game of basketball. It happens.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"I think for us, this is a quick turn, so we don't have time to, like, go to the park or anything. We got to figure out how to score the ball, take care of the ball.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Again, Brown and Tatum, when you give up 60 points to those guys, we don't have time to go clear our minds. We've got to do better. That's for everybody who's playing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it looked -- looks can be deceiving.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think when you look at experience, we're all learning what it means to be on this stage and going through it. There's a lot of young players on our side who have never done this before. Just understand, we'll talk about that, that this experience that we're going through is a healthy thing. It's not a bad thing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,We're down 3-0. We felt like Game 2 and Game 3 were better for us. That's the way we have to play. Then offensively we just got to get some other people to step up and make some shots.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,End of the fourth? I called a couple timeouts.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,That's tough. Why you guys laughing? I asked what timeout was it. I called a couple timeouts. You got to do better.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Thank you. We missed the three and we missed Ky's pullup. It's a one-possession game. We exerted lot of energy on the defensive end and the offensive end, so that's why we called a timeout.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JASON KIDD,That's for clarify that. Way to step up.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, they're a good team. They're going to make adjustments. They know how much of our offense over the Playoff run has been predicated on getting easy looks for our bigs.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"They've been taking it away, putting guards on the bigs, not really helping off of them. A lot of one-on-one defense.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,It's about us finishing and hopefully that creates some space where we can throw a lob.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I don't think I really had a choice. It was unfortunate that the foul was called. Luka picked up his fifth and sixth in a matter of a three-minute or two-minute span. It's tough.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"We still had to figure out a way to win the basketball game. We put our best foot forward, especially being down 21. We easily could have packed up and folded.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But we didn't give up. We kept playing. The guys that were out there, we kept competing. Felt like we gave ourselves a chance to win down the stretch.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But when you're going against a good juggernaut offensive team like the Boston Celtics, they're going to make you pay for mistakes. You got to give them credit.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, but it was a quick look. I mean, we're in the NBA Finals. I'm not really thinking I've got to tell my guys we still have a chance to win the game, we're only down by three points.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But yeah, I think probably in that stretch, I definitely could have done a better job of just settling them for what's coming. Jrue was picking me up full court. They knew they were going to pressure me to get the ball out of my hands.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I just tried to make the right plays, make sure guys were in the right spots, have them understand that we still have a chance to win this basketball game. That was all I was thinking. Just even before Luka fouled out, just the way we started off the fourth quarter, giving up those two baskets where they went up 21.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, we could have folded but we kept playing.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, I just really think about going home. This is a metaphor here. Just be ready smiling. Just go home, get the ammo ready, get the bazooka, the 50 cal ready. Get everything ready, because when we come into Game 4, we know we got to shoot our shots and we got to do it with an aggression.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"We just got to stay positive. For me personally, again, I'm going home, dusting off the tools and just getting ready for a tough Game 4.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time a team has tried to target Luka on the defensive end. So for us, we're just trying to put a great shell defense around not only him, but the rest of the team.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It's going to be a great defensive challenge for anybody to guard Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. You have other guys that are playing roles that are pretty much great team roles they fulfilled. Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, they're great offensive players too, but when you have those guys on the backside making decisions, playing high IQ, they're going to make you pay for your mistakes.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,Then you got you Derrick White catching the ball by his waist or above his head and still shooting the threes and making timely threes.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, you got to give them credit. Still, we have a belief that we can win one game at a time and take this series a little bit further.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question. I think when you see us out there, there are a lot of shots at the rim that are contested by one person or two people. I think at this point it's more of a pride thing for us to go and finish.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I definitely wasn't there emotionally or mature-wise. He definitely deserves his flowers. He rallied us tonight. Came to the bench and just told us to keep believing. When you have one of the youngest team on the team, if not the youngest guy on the team speaking like that, one of two choices. We can either follow his lead and continue to ride his energy, or we fold up. I think that we made the former choice, and we kept playing and kept competing. Just wasn't enough.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,But I got to give a big shut out to D Live for keeping us at bay and keeping us at peace. That was special. That was special. Those are moments that you remember forever and you carry on as a team that can help you down the line.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"We just got to convert. I feel like we're getting a lot of shots that we like. When you have Luka going against Payton Pritchard or D White in the post, somebody else in the post, we feel really good about it.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,Now isn't the time to hold our head on not converting shots that we normally have made a majority of this playoff run. We just got to keep attacking.,,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"You just got to let it breathe a little bit. Let the human emotions come out. Just give him a hug. That's it, man.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It's easy to point the finger at just him, say, you could be better. That's easy to say. I think he knows that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But, yeah, it's reiterating that I have his back, we all have his back. It's a tough game. It was a tough call. We could have probably done a little bit something different on his fifth foul just to give us a little bit more of a grace period to set our defense and get him on a matchup.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,AL HORFORD,"It felt great. It felt like we played really good basketball. Our defense was really good.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we needed to stay poised. We feel like we have been in these positions before and weve learned in the past from it, and I feel like we handled it well. D-White made a big three there late. JB and JT made some big plays, and Jrue defensively was all over the place. We just find a way to get it done.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,AL HORFORD,Just continuing to play. Understanding that Kyrie was going to be more aggressive and we had to do a good job guarding him.,,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Obviously, I was probably going to play some more. Then we needed somebody from the bench to come in and give us minutes, and Xavier was amazing tonight. His energy, defensively he held his own, time and time again. He was just ready for the moment.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,AL HORFORD,"Its not easy being in that position. He came in and he knocks down that big three as well. But defensively he was special.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I feel like we have been doing it all year. Weve been battle tested. Weve been in situations like this before, up 20, down 15 or whatever it is. Really just stayed together and stayed composed.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,LUKA DONCIC,"I think we should have just kept playing with the same energy, keep the same people in. We were rolling down there.",,,,

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,11-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,06-Jun,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that.",,,,
2023 - NBA DRAFT,22-Jun,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me.

Just someone that is going to work hard.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage.",,,,

I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort.",,,,

They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down.

Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.,,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,06-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned.",,,,
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,10-Apr,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,11-Jun,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,09-Jun,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,18-Oct,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,11-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,08-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,11-Jun,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,12-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,09-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level.",,,,
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,10-Apr,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,09-Jun,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,12-Jun,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy.",,,,
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,10-Apr,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,09-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,06-Jun,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that.",,,,

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,08-Jun,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow.

That's the quote I live by.",,,,

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with.

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,08-Jun,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well.",,,,
