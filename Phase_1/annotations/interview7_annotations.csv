2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,GABE VINCENT,"It will be a tall task, and we'll continue to work at it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,JIMMY BUTLER,"For me, yeah, you've got to attack and attack everybody, not just one individual. I have to do a better job of creating the help, one, two guys, and getting to my shooter, otherwise finishing at the rim, making shots.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,JIMMY BUTLER,"But we missed a lot tonight and we'll be better in Game 2. At the end of the day, that's what it is, and we'll take this and we'll learn from it, and we'll be back in two days.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BRUCE BROWN JR,I don't think there's any secret. It's tough. But our game plan was trying not to foul. We know they're going to pump fake a lot. Jimmy is great at it. Gabe has been doing it. Bam has been doing it. So just trying to get our hands in the air and jump for everything.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, our second unit, we usually switch one through five because we've got Jeff at the 5. It just makes it a lot easier for us and the second unit. We can be more physical, more aggressive, and try to get stops and get out in transition.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, it was great. Everybody was on a string. Everybody knew what we were supposed to be doing. Huge shout-out to Mike Porter Jr.. I've seen a few things of him not being a great defender, but he was great for us tonight, challenging at the rim, getting blocks and rebounding. So, kudos to him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, we were ready, but I was dead in the first. I'm going to be honest, I was cramping. But you've got to get used to the altitude every time we leave and come back, so I think we did a pretty good job.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"Definitely. And also, I made open shots. I made the shot that I usually shoot.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"Definitely. Definitely comfortable with the shots we took. You know, I felt like we had a lot of open shots tonight. Ball just didn't go in. That's part of the game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,But I feel like our shooters will bounce back.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like early in the game, miscommunications caused a lot of our guys to not talk enough. Miscommunications, and a lot of guys were open in the first half.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like going into the second half, we definitely got better with the cadence and talked through it more.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"I don't, honestly. I don't think that was part of the game anyway. I mean, we didn't -- I didn't even think about the altitude until you just said it. But the biggest thing is we just missed open shots. We took care of the ball. We got it where it was supposed to go. We just missed shots today.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,We made history.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"No. I mean, when we got in the locker room and seen the stat sheet, I feel like that we were all shocked that we only had two free throws.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, Jamal, he's a three-level scorer He can shoot the three, he can pull up and get to the rim. Just got to make it difficult as much as possible. He's a crafty player, has a good handle. He's in good condition.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"So I mean, we've got to just key in on him and just make it as tough as possible for him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"And yeah, I'll probably be guarding him a lot this series as well, and we have a lot of different guys who can guard him. So it will be interesting to see how we do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"But like I said, I feel like we'll bounce back Game 2.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I mean, this is the ultimate stage, the Finals. I've been prepared for it. I've been working at this my whole life. I'm built for this. You know, the ups and downs through the season I've been through and the ups and downs I've been through in my career.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"So you know, I'm ready to go, and I'm built for this, like I said.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"If I do say something, will you take the fine? Laughter.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"Like I said, I just feel like we can't even get into that. You know, we can't let them dictate the game. I just feel like we took a lot of jumpshots, and we missed a lot of them instead of getting to the basket.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"Like I said, we're going to watch film and get back to the drawing board.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"I feel really fortunate because I've had a front-row seat to when he was undrafted and we signed him. To see kind of the highs and lows that he's gone through, in Charlotte getting a few opportunities with his brother, to being let go by the Hornets and then to where he's at now, being a huge piece in what we're doing here. To be in the Finals is really a testament to how hard he's worked. He's one of the ultimate competitors.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"Yeah, not too much. It's just really fun because it's all the media that you see here today, all the fans, millions of people watching at home, it all comes down to 10 people on the court, and that's what we live for. That's what we live for, the battle. At the end of the day, you've still got to line it up. We believe in the competitors that we have in our locker room, so we aren't afraid of anyone. We aren't afraid of the moment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"It's definitely been a fun locker room to be a part of. For me having played with different organizations and played for 10 years, this is such a fun opportunity for me to play in the Finals but also just to be a part of this locker room.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"Yeah, obviously they're both super talented individually but also them working together. That's a lot of their fourth-quarter offense. It's a lot of what they go through. Obviously Murray can put up big numbers and Jokic can do a little bit of everything. Obviously he gets the rest of the guys involved. He can pass it. He's been shooting it incredibly well in the Playoffs.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,So they can do a little bit of everything. There's no perfect way to guard it. There's no perfect matchup. But you just try to make it tough on them.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"I've been in the league for 10 years, and I've guarded him a lot. Not saying I've stopped him a lot, but I've guarded him a lot. I think that's the biggest thing is just having a little bit of experience. I think what he does best is pass, gets all of his teammates involved. Of course they make some easy buckets off of him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"But you say that, and he's had some crazy scoring games, as well. It's not like you can only defend him against the pass.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"He's a handful. I'm sure it's going to be all hands on deck. Bam is a good defender, and I'm sure I'll get my try. I'm sure we'll try some smaller guys on him, try some bigger guys on him. It'll be kind of all hands on deck just to try to slow him down.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"We're really close. Actually I'm getting married in August, and Bobby is going to be one of my groomsmen. We're that close.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"He was one of the first people that reached out to me when I got drafted in Charlotte my rookie year. I didn't know a single person in Charlotte, 20 years old, moving away from home, and him and his wife, Tess, cooked me home-cooked meals once a week when I was in Charlotte. We played tennis together, ping-pong, board games. We'd do all kinds of stuff.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CODY ZELLER,"He's become really good for me, as well, just because he's been -- he's won a championship, he's a Hall of Famer, but he also kind of puts things into perspective of there's more to life than just basketball, as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"This season has been interesting. We've had highs. We've had lows. Obviously we've made a push from the 8 seed to the Finals. We've showed a lot of resilience, a lot of persistence, a lot of belief in one another, and we're just excited for the opportunity that's ahead.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, obviously we take the experience from this past series into the next, but this is a totally different series now. We start from blank, we start from scratch. It's 0-0, and we just try to approach each game with the right mindset and just try to take care of business.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"Doing well, thank you.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"I'd say the support of my family and friends has helped me over time, but I think you grow confidence in anything you're doing with the amount of work you put in, whether it's cooking or golf or basketball. I think we all put a lot of hours and time in and extra reps and shots, et cetera, that when the time comes, you have faith and have confidence because of the work you have instilled.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"This group especially has put in a lot of work on the court, off the court, battling together. We're definitely a confident group.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I'd say one of the most important things I've learned at Santa Barbara was the value of relationships. And I just had to alter my leadership style maybe at that time as a young kid to what it is now. And just continue to grow and evolve and find ways to be a better leader, to better inspire, to just help move the needle with whatever group I'm with as best as I can.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,A 10 out of 10. I love Jimmy's music taste. We go back and forth with music. I could listen to music with Jimmy for hours.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MAX STRUS,"I'm not worried about it at all. We're ready to play. It don't matter where it's at, where we're playing. We're ready for everything. It's not going to be a problem at all.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MAX STRUS,"Mike is talented, man. We've got the same agent, so I've known him for a while. He can shoot the ball really well and get it off very quick, so he's definitely going to be a problem that we've got to make sure we keep an eye on and not let him get too hot, because we know if he makes a couple, he can get it going. So definitely keep an eye on him, as well as the other guys.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MAX STRUS,"Oh, that's probably something every day that I could say. Me and Jimmy got a unique relationship. It's like Kyle just said, like 2011, I was still in high school, and watching him play on the Bulls, and me being from Chicago just growing up watching him, it's kind of crazy that I'm on his team trying to help him win a championship here.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MAX STRUS,"I'm just here to help him whatever he needs and whatever he asks me to do or for the team to do, I'm willing to do it because he's one of the most highest basketball IQs I've ever been a part of and been around.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, Jimmy just wants to win at any cost. He's not worried about any of the extracurricular stuff. He just wants to play basketball at the highest level and play the right way, and that's how we're all built. He just goes about it with that confidence, and he doesn't need to talk. He lets his playing do the talking, and we're all just here following in his footsteps, and he just gives our team the utmost confidence in each other.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MAX STRUS,"I think he gives the belief in you by putting you out there. We all come from two-ways or undrafted guys. So, the ability to get the opportunity to play shows that he believes in you the most, in the fullest. It trickles down from our star players guys like Bam, Jimmy, Kyle. They believe in everybody in our lineup, that we can go out there and help win games and win at a high level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MAX STRUS,"To have the trust from them and the coaching staff, it just trickles down and has us be the most belief in ourselves, and it's a special thing. It's a really special thing to be a part of, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We're not getting into any of that stuff. Our guys are in great shape. They're ready to compete. If Denver wants to tip this thing off at the top of Everest, we'll do that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This thing is going to be decided between the four lines. They've also got to come back to Miami. If you want to make it about that, we'll turn off the air conditioning and they've got to play in 90-degree humidity, sap the s--- out of their legs. This thing is going to be decided between those four lines, and we'll decide it then.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think it's been defined enough. I think you can just look at all the, whatever, thousand other articles about it. I don't think anybody wants to hear about it. It's something we believe in. It's for us. It's not for everybody.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I also think you do have to credit and acknowledge Denver's culture. They have a very strong culture. I don't think it's a coincidence that the two teams have been able to have sustained success, and they've done a great job of building their culture.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Mike and his staff have just done a tremendous job of building a system that fits perfectly around their two top players, and they do all the right things. You're not going to have any kind of weaknesses or glitches or cracks in a culture or professionalism or anything like that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We feel the same way about our group. I just think it's set up for great competition.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, I probably think more than anything, it's just the more experience you have, just the more gratitude you have for any of these kind of opportunities. This league is so fragile. It is so tough to go through the gauntlet. Not only just a regular season, 82 games, five and a half months, but then to go through the gauntlet of three seven-game series just to get to this point. You're just really grateful for these kind of opportunities.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This is a special group. This group has been able to overcome a lot of different things, handle a lot of adversity, setbacks, things that have not gone the way we wanted it to go. Instead of having that collapse our spirit, it allowed us to develop some fortitude and grit collectively and give us something to rally around, which was each other.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Those are special qualities. I mentioned the other night, it's a reflection of life to be able to develop those kind of things that can get you through the tough times, and then when you overcome it, just makes things a lot more gratifying.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He's very unique. He doesn't really have any noticeable weaknesses in terms of his size, his skill set. He's one of one in the myriad of ways that he can impact the game and impact winning.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have great respect for the Denver Nuggets' organization, how they operate and the system that they run. That's the way it should be. You shouldn't be playing any ducks at this point when you get to the Finals.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know why maybe the mainstream media have kind of slept on Denver, but when we saw them in the bubble, we thought, all right, this team is going to be doing basically what they're doing this year, then up until now. We thought this would be a run for a long time. If Murray didn't get hurt, they probably would have had a couple of Finals berths. That's how great of a duo they are and a system Mike and his staff have built that really fits.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think, we all think they're legit, and in some ways, it's a mirror image series, not in terms of style, but teams that probably have been overlooked, underestimated, built a chip on their shoulder over that. It's lined up to be a great competition.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'm not a math guy, so I'm not good with percentages. He will not play tomorrow.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We don't want to get ahead of ourselves right now. He's still just starting this process. We do have a few days here just to continuous work. I can't even make any kind of proclamation until he takes these next important steps, and that's with contact and doing things more on the court live.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We'll just see. We're all encouraged by his progress that he's made, but we want to continue to be responsible and make the best decisions. He's not there yet.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's still going to be all hands on deck. However this thing starts tomorrow, it probably will be similar to the last series, and it's going to look different by the end of the series. You have to be open to all the different possibilities. Both K-Love and Cody are major pieces to what we do. When you're dealing with a guy like Jokic, you're probably going to need several bigs, and thankfully we do have that kind of roster depth at that position. They all bring something a little bit different.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Nobody is going to be a, quote-unquote, stopper in this series. This is about competing every single possession, finding different kind of advantages in the margins that only competitors can find. But thankfully we do have both of those guys, and we were able to pick them up late.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Well, they're both dynamic. They both can do it on their own, but they also both really complement each other. That's hard to find in this league, when your two best players just absolutely complement each other. They both have scored 50 in a playoff game, and they both can be facilitators.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I don't think either one of them care how many points they score. It's just about getting the most efficient shot for the offense.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I didn't really think about it like that because back then, I was still thinking, hey, I'm going to play in the league. I definitely wasn't thinking, I want to be Jack Ramsay. I was scared of him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The story has been told many times, but I probably had a little bit more awareness, I'm going nowhere as a player, and when Rick Adelman was the coach -- Jack Ramsay was the first image I had of a head coach. He was the coach of our team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"As I got older in high school and college, it was Rick. I just loved the way he operated. He's been a big mentor to me, so the Adelman kids, including David, and I've known David since he was probably 3, we were all running around the facility.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But that's probably when I followed them the most, was when they made those two Finals runs.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, that wasn't really a thought. It was more just celebrating that team and really trying to support all the families. The organizations were much smaller then, so it really felt like a family deal. You grew up with the organization, just trying to support them and figure out how they could knock off those Bulls teams.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's those moments when nobody else understands. Nobody else is in the locker room. Nobody else -- we say that all the time, our guys are the men in the arena. It's tough to explain it to people on the outside.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But when you have these privileges to be able to go through adversity or setbacks and learn from that, I think those are lessons that we all could benefit from. You develop a grit and a collective perseverance and fortitude. If you approach it the right way, which this group does, you can really grow. They can be incredible life experiences, to be able to come together like that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But Denver has a very similar personality. We didn't necessarily hang out with them in the bubble, but competitors recognize competitors and we would acknowledge them. We didn't have to face them in the Playoffs, but we always just seemed to bump into them. The staffs would bump into each other out on the lake. For whatever reason we were all fishing out there, and those were the two organizations that were doing it. I have no idea why.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But they're good people, great competitors. We have respect for them. They have an edge. Mike has an edge. That edge is going to be there for both sides. It's going to be decided between those four lines. This is what you want. You want the greatest challenges in this league. You're not expecting anything to be easy, particularly when you get to this level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We just want to get this started. We have great, great competitors that want to put themselves out there for everybody to see and judge and have no fear about it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Man, it's been gratifying. I can't thank the Lord enough, to be honest with you. It's been a great ride. Like you said, it's been a long run, 13 years, 13 teams. To get to this time and this level, it feels really, really good. I'm excited about it, but we've got four more to go. I'm a kid that has always been somebody -- I don't really kind of realize I'm in it until it's over with, so now that we're in it, we've just got to get four more, and I think I'll kind of soak it all in.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Yeah, me, DJ and Jeff, I guess we're the old heads, so for us, you could see DJ in the back kind of soaking it all in. Me and Jeff hugged each other -- I think I hugged him tighter than I hug my wife.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"It was just a situation where we were like -- I think the young guys don't really understand the grind that you go through. So it felt good. It felt really, really good.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Like I said, still four more to go, but then it settles in and you're like, hold on, this is just the Conference Finals now we've got to get to the Finals-Finals and go from there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Oh, you know what, we talked about it in training camp. This organization has been really, really good. I know I haven't been here for a long time, but it's been very organized. It's a team that knows what it wants, the plan, how we want to play, from the top to the coaches, everybody.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"It's been great. It's been fun. I can't even lie to you. You usually don't say that when you're not playing and you're in like a leadership role. But it's been fun. When we won the Western Conference Finals, we all had a moment in the back of the plane. That kind of like sums everything up how much this year has been.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Families have enjoyed it, so it's been good. It's been really, really good. The Nuggets, man, we're going to be here to stay for a long, long time, especially when you've got 15 Nikola Jokic and 27 Jamal Murray. It goes a long way when you've got those two guys.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Honestly, I think you've got to take constructive criticism. I think when people tell you you can't do something, don't take it personal. Realize what you have to do to get better, find your fit, whatever that is. And then on top of that, just keep going, keep pushing, keep pressing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Like I said, I can't thank the Lord enough about this journey, how it's been. It's been fun. But that's the biggest thing I try to tell people Don't take anything personal. Whatever people tell you, take it as constructive criticism, try to get better at it and just keep pushing and pressing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"You know what, I'm still moving pretty fast, so we'll see. We'll see. Right now I'm just enjoying this, and as long as I'm here, as long as they want me to be back here or anywhere else, I'm going to be here.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Somebody told me, a vet told me, he was like, you don't want to have any regrets, so when you're done, you don't want to be like, man, I can still play. Until they cut off the lights and say don't come back, I'm going to be out here playing. You're still going to see No. 14 running fast.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Yeah, altitude is a real thing. It usually gives you about a week and a half, two weeks for you to kind of get adjusted to it. Then after that, you find your flow, you find your feeling. You really feel it when you go to opposing gyms. So when you go and play other teams, you realize you can run longer and faster and harder. It really is an advantage. But it takes you about a week and a half, two weeks. For me it did. I don't know about everybody else.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"MJ. I was truly thankful about my journey going all the way around. I think I've been on 45 different teams. One of them was in Charlotte. Having Mike as an owner, meeting him -- it's funny because that's what I grew up on, NBA on NBC. So you see MJ and it was just a surreal moment to sign with him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"That's what I think about. When I think about the Finals, that was my era, the '90s. I was a kid. Mike dominated the '90s. There were a lot of great players. That just speaks to how great he was.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ISH SMITH,"Yes, sir, and he made a lot of moments.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I mean, we've played here before, so it's not some folklore that no one has seen before. A lot of us have played here a handful of times.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,It's nothing new. We don't expect it to have any sort of impact.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, they're playing really well. They have a handful of guys that can beat you on any given night. Obviously starts with those main two, Jokic and Murray.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Really talented offensively, and they're going to make you work for everything defensively. They pose a great challenge for us. We're excited about it. Definitely they play differently a little bit than some of the other teams that we've played, just so much of their offense being focused around those two, but both those guys are such willing passers, as well. It'll be a good challenge.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But there's always moments to be able to sit back and reflect. A lot of it comes from sharing memories and experiences with people that have kind of been around for the entirety of the journey, family, friends, people in my corner, that are able to kind of offer me that perspective. I value those moments and conversations very much so with those people in particular.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, Mexico City was an amazing experience. I just remember the excitement, the energy in that arena. From when we got out there, shootaround and warmups, an hour plus before the game, it was basically packed. Just the entire country it felt like, just excited to have us there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It was definitely a memorable game, to be able to win that one. A lot has changed, a lot has transpired since then for this group in particular. We've had a lot of ups and downs. But that was definitely a cool moment to look back on in the season.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think the fact that he garners so much attention because he can score, but you have to be smart with how you approach it because he's such a willing passer and they're so good at playing off his overreaction. Finding that balance between making it difficult on him and throwing different looks and multiple defenders and what have you, while also making it so he doesn't constantly get everybody involved and easy looks and get them going as an offensive unit.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think we have a connection and a competitive spirit, especially lately, just throughout the midst of this run. I think it's kind of all coming together at the right time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Those two things alone can really, really carry you. You're going to have stretches where the ball is not going in or maybe not playing the way that you want to as a group, but if you kind of have that collective trust and competitive spirit and grit to fall back on, I think that always gives you a chance.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Kyle brings a ton of experience, obviously, from a years-in-the-league standpoint and also playoff experience and somebody who's held that trophy at the end. It's a huge luxury to have somebody like that in the locker room.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Obviously I share the court with him a lot, kind of in that second group. He just can come in and just change the whole rhythm and flow of a game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"His impact is so much more than what you see in a box score or what shows up in terms of maybe the game film. He's a trusted leader, somebody that we all kind of count on. I think he does a really good job of navigating that line between discipline and holding people accountable while also maintaining a certain sense of humor and levity to it, as well. He's been huge for us, for sure.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,Fist pumping.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it's been nice. I've had a lot of friends text me about the watch parties, gathering around. The support has been crazy back home. That means a lot, especially from a small town like Kitchener.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Excited for that town. Be back there in the summer, see my friends and family. But, yeah, no one from Kitchener has made the this far, so it's nice to be a pioneer in that sense.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,Always had the fire to be on the floor. I didn't need to be in broadcasting to find that fire.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,It was cool to see all the attention that the Raptors got at that time. It was just cool to be a fan of the game at that time of the year. It's even better to be playing.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,It's cool to see. Saw it at the pop-up shop at the gas station the other day. Thought that was cool. Haven't seen that before out here.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"All the little things. Seeing my jersey more often. Anybody's, honestly. To see the city rally behind the team, even the other teams, other players on other teams. I think Kyle wore my jersey while he was practicing. I think that was cool. Saw him at dinner the other day, too.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,Everybody in the city is behind us. That means a lot.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,I always loved basketball. Couldn't afford the equipment for hockey at the time. Basketball was the easiest thing to give me.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I just fell in love with it. The only thing I wanted to do. Night and day, it made me happy, and still does to this day smiling.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Strengthen my knee, as well smiling.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"But, yeah, it was nice to not have -- obviously the outside noise can be pressure, regardless if you're healthy or not at the time. To have the team say to you, It's up to you, if you want to come back, if you're ready. If not, it's okay. We'll wait.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"That meant a lot, knowing that I was in no rush and that I could just focus on my health at the time. I was still working to get back. Just that mental factor of having something to strive for at the time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"But wasn't there. Now you look back, my dad at the time, he didn't want me to play either, just knowing what I can do, how I should look, especially to him. He's been watching me my whole life. At the time I didn't look like that, even if I was making shots or whatever. I knew I wasn't 100.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,To hear from him meant a lot more. It was a team effort in that decision.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, watched all the games.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, it's best of seven, first to four. We didn't know who we were going to play. We prepared for both. Once we finally knew, it kind of brought us all to ease to be able to prepare mentally just for the matchups, game plan, all that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was a little relieving to see, a couple days ago, the result. Yeah, we're excited.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Show your hands. Be in stance. It's going to take a team effort, crowd. Verticality, jumping straight up when he attacks the rim. He's going to throw his body at you. He's going to fall to the floor. You just got to stay solid and be as legal as possible. That's a couple things to touch on.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just keep that same mentality. I know there's a lot of media in here and stuff, but we have four wins to go. Keep that same mind state, stay focused. Can't get relaxed or complacent. I think that's the biggest thing. Or satisfied. We haven't won a championship. Until then, stay in the right mindset and everything will come.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. I remember watching LeBron against the Spurs, when the Spurs swept in the Finals. I remember Miami versus the Spurs smiling. I don't know. I don't remember specifics.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just remember the stage, the crowd being really into it, all the eyes, everybody talking about it within the city, outside. It's just a great environment to be in.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,Excited for the opportunity. We want to make the most of it.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,Every time smiling.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Funny thing is it wasn't just for the championship. I used to, like, write down the playoff seeding, put myself on one of the teams, then play. If we played Detroit Pistons, I would go against Billups and Rasheed Wallace, and just talk like Marv Albert, all of them. I was in deep. I was making shot after shot, trust me laughter.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Oh, I can be honest about it. I can be honest about it laughter.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, as players. I'm talking about a basketball camp.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"But me and Ben were there. I was coaching him up. He was really athletic, as he is now, jumping over everybody. Couldn't shoot as well as he could now. Developed his game a little bit. Matured so much. So proud of him as a fellow Canadian.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"We played one on one. I think I hit a couple stepbacks, little fadeaways.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,I am. We're talking four years ago.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,This guy over here. Next question laughter.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I was trying to get your confidence up. I remember that. I got you.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think I was giving you confidence. Yeah, for sure. You asked me to be honest, I'm being honest smiling.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,I think these are the two last teams remaining. Have the most chemistry within each other. Lowry has been a champion. Jimmy has been in the Playoffs a ton. I remember we played Jimmy in Minnesota for the eight seed. I forget what year. I think it was 2018.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,I'm trying to go through the team.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Drafted or not, they can all play. They play really well. The handoffs that they do. They put us in a lot of actions. The ball is hopping. They're unselfish looking for the shot, looking for the best shot. They use the whole shot clock. I think they're very well-rounded team and they trust each other. They've trusted each other a lot throughout the season. I think that's what sets them apart from all the other teams in the East that they faced.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think they're really together through the ups and downs. They're very resilient. Kind of like us in a sense where we're very resilient. Been together, continuity, chemistry, ball hops, unselfish. They're more of a gritty defensive team throughout the season, and we're more of an offensive powerhouse throughout the season.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JAMAL MURRAY,I think it's going to be a fun series.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"Man, he's been huge in motivating us and just getting us right mentally. You can definitely tell he works on himself in the mental aspect. He studies that and he betters himself and he takes pride in that, and to be able to relay those messages in the way they're relayed to us has been super important to us, and how prepared we are not only physically but mentally.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"Yes, they're a unique team. They've got a lot of different ways of scoring, putting the ball in the hoop, and they share the ball. You can tell they really love playing together, and I think that's what's so important and that's gotten them to this point, and I think that's what makes them special is they share the ball and they score and put the ball in the hole in multiple ways.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"We definitely have to figure out different type of plans. I'm sure we'll adjust a lot on the fly to figure out how to keep that ball away from the rim, but they've got one of the best players in the league, and we'll just have to figure it out.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I think the G League has improved tremendously. I think they do a great job even promoting the guys that are playing there. Luckily enough when I was playing there, especially in Greensboro, I was on NBA assignment. So, I had the luxury of being able to play heavy minutes and get plays and get shots.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,But it really got me better just playing and learning how to play and being in a different environments and positions. And just the talent that's in the G League is so overlooked. There's so many people that can play at an NBA level at any given night and play very well and contribute to a winning team.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think the talent aspect and the preparation that it takes to play well, even in the G League, definitely helps you get to this point.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"For sure. I talk about that all the time. We've got the leader, the head of the snake of our team, got drafted 30th. He wasn't a lottery pick or anything like that. His path to get to where he is is very similar to a lot of ours. He was very overlooked coming up, even through high school and college and those type of things. He didn't have all the five stars and all the Kentuckys and Carolinas going after him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"Looking at a guy like that, he definitely gives you hope, and also just puts it in perspective that it's about the long game it's not about having everything at once. It might take some people two, three years, might take some people nine years. But just sticking with it and continuing to perfect your craft can put you in a great position.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, it's definitely been a little different for sure, getting recognition or attention.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"But I feel like more often than not right now, this is a time that I kind of stay away from social media, especially when you're this close to -- you're four games away from being a champion, I think this is the most important time to stay locked in, stay focused. But this is what comes with it, whenever you're winning and you're moving on, this stuff.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"So, it's great publicity and I'm very grateful and appreciative that even Bam, guys like that, are saying that I've made a name for myself because that's the whole reason I've been trying to prove myself since I've been in the league. But it's one thing to do it once for a series or whatever, and it's another thing to stay consistent.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"I got a ton of messages from my people, man. Some messages I can't really say on here, but it's all been positive and supportive.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,He's definitely going to come. He's going to come here and he's going to make sure he's in town and make sure he comes to see me play.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"But all my people hit me up, just congratulating me, but that's how I know my people understand and they want me to get four more just because -- just as hyped as they are right now, they're trying to keep me focused saying, we've got four more. Stay focused for four more. So got one more round to try to get to where we're trying to get, but my people couldn't be happier right now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,He called me before I got undressed.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"I don't know if he's -- he's definitely going to be at some games for sure. I already talked to him about that. I don't know which ones yet, but yeah, he called me before I got undressed after Game 7. Just hyped, just screaming, just jumping up and down. That's like my brother.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"He was just as hyped as my family was. He's one of the first people that called me. Yeah, man, that's my dog. He's super proud, super appreciative, and couldn't be happier.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"I think just getting our foot in the door. I think that was the biggest thing for us. We just knew we had a gear, and once we got into the Playoffs, it was kind of a relief. Now we could just focus on playing. We just knew we liked our chances pretty much with anybody, knowing that it was the first team to four.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"It's different when it's like the NCAA Tournament and the play-in. We had two chances, but other teams had one chance. After losing that first one, we knew it was the only chance we had to get into the Playoffs. Once we finally got in, we could take a deep breath, get back to focusing on just playing, and knowing that a team had to beat us four times, and it was going to be tough.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"I think most importantly, what I learned from them is after the losses, because I'm so used to getting down on myself. It's kind of like a college mentality where I've kind of had to learn from that where you get so mad and get so down on yourself, beat yourself up about losses, and I kind of look at the way those guys operate after losses, and not that they don't care, but they understand it's a series. It's multiple games, it's not just one game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CALEB MARTIN,"They also understand how quick the turnaround is for the next one, to be able to come in with the right mindset that you kind of let things, leave them in the rear view. So, I've been trying to learn that and I think I've matured in that aspect just from being around those guys. So, I think that's really important for me and the growth of my game so far.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is part of it. You have an option to look at it as a distraction or look at it as part of the process. This is the NBA Finals. Doesn't get any bigger than this. So we got our work in upstairs in the friendly confines of our practice court and behind closed doors. Then we come downstairs and do our part, make ourselves available.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I'm just following the lead of Nick O'Hayre and the NBA, doing what they tell me to do, answering the same questions for a third day in a row. But I love it and I got a smile on my face smiling.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,That's an interesting question. And my father did try to talk me out of it. I don't know if Rick Adelman or Flip Saunders did for their respective kids.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I had Wes Unseld on my staff prior, another guy that grew up in this business. I think for David Adelman, whose father, Rick, is a Hall of Famer, for Ryan Saunders, whose dad, Flip, God rest his soul, was tremendous to me in my career.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, it's just having basketball people. They're junkies. David Adelman eats, drinks, sleeps basketball, as does Ryan, everybody on my staff.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"There's something to be said growing up the son of a coach, being around the game at every level. My father was a high school coach in New York City, a college coach, an NBA coach, a head coach in the NBA. For Ryan Saunders and the journey that Flip was on throughout the CBA and the NBA, and for Rick Adelman and his many stops. You're hiring somebody that knows the game and knows what comes with the game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I feel really fortunate to have the staff that I have, not because they're coaches' sons, but they're great guys who help me out a ton.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I mean, I think they use zone more possessions than anybody. I thought their zone and their pressure back to zone was key in that last series against Boston. I thought it gave Boston trouble.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"As you've mentioned, we've seen zone all year long. I think we have one of the better zone efficiencies on the offensive end. Right now in the Playoffs, I think our offensive rating is maybe the best for a team that's ever been in the Finals. We're prepared for it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"If we do see the zone, a lot of teams when they see the zone will panic instead of just playing the game, getting the ball into the middle of the zone, using dribble penetration to collapse the zone.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The other thing we talk about, if we call a play, they're in zone, just run the play. This is not college. Bam Adebayo cannot stand in the paint. He's got to cleanse himself at some point.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I'll say to that is the best zone offense is your defense. If you get stops and rebounds, that makes it really hard for a team to fall back into a 2-3 zone and try to take you out of your rhythm.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, the last part first.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"That was a discussion we had the day after he suffered the ACL. That was, like, important for him to hear, in my opinion, because in that moment it's devastation. Negativity fills your mind about what's going to happen, how do I come back from this. That rehab process can be a torturous one, one that takes a lot of mental toughness.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Jamal is really fortunate because he has a wonderful mother, father and brother, close-knit family. He had an organization, from myself, the front office, ownership, teammates and medical staff, that supported him from day one.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Going into the Playoffs last year, you use the word ""flicker,"" there was a flicker of hope last game of the regular season against the Lakers. Maybe Jamal can play, be back for the Playoffs. It wasn't there. He wasn't ready. We weren't going to push him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then throughout the summer, as he worked out in different places, whether it was at home, here, in Phoenix, he took a trip over to Australia, and I saw a video of him playing over there. That's when I knew that he was ready to come back and start the journey to recovery, and more importantly the journey to being the best version of himself as possible.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Couldn't be more proud of Jamal. Nikola Jokic was deserving of the MVP last round. Fully deserved it. Averaged a triple-double. If you saw what Jamal did in the Western Conference Finals, in a sweep, 32 points, maybe 50, 40, 90 in terms of his percentages, six rebounds, six assists, it was just incredible.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I've been here for eight years now. I think, if anything, the fans here, not just in Denver, but Nugget fans everywhere, even back home in Serbia, I think they appreciate and respect him for that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's not trying to be something he's not. He's not trying to create a narrative other than I'm Nikola Jokic, I play for the Denver Nuggets, I'm going to do everything I can to help our team win. I'm going to do it with class, professionalism. I'm never going to make it about me. That's a rarity.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I often make the comparison, I never coached Tim Duncan, but just from coaching against him and hearing stories about those that have been around him, Tim Duncan was a selfless superstar.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I look at Nikola Jokic in the same vein. I think he's a truly selfless superstar, where it's not about him. He's not looking for people to ""Look at me, tell me how great I am."" He's almost embarrassed by the attention. He wants to be one of the guys in the locker room, have fun, work hard and win.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's the thing that motivates every one of us. We have yet to win a championship. That's why we're excited to be here, but know we have a ton of work. It's going to be the hardest challenge that any of us have faced in our NBA careers.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"It hasn't come up in any of my thoughts, discussions, narratives. That's a question probably more suited for the Miami Heat. For us, all we're worried about is winning Game 1 tomorrow night. That's our sole focus. None of the storylines that accompany this series are going to distract us from that focus.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, there was a game in his rookie season. Just to backtrack a little bit, to Nikola's credit, once we got back from Las Vegas that first Summer League where he was a solid player, he realized at that point in time that I got to get in better shape and I have to lose weight. He did that, like, right away. I think that was a sign for me that this kid is serious about this.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But there was a game in his rookie season at San Antonio. He put up a crazy stat line, I don't know, 25 or 26 points, 12 or 13 rebounds, six or seven assists against a guy like Tim Duncan. That was, for me, kind of when that light bulb went off saying, Wow, what he just did, who he did it against, on the road against this team coached by that guy, this kid has a chance to be a special player.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,I think the second-most-important moment in Nikola's and our history was second year when we tried to play Nikola and Jusuf Nurkic together to start that year. Did not go as well as we had hoped. I was bringing Nikola off the bench. We lost the game at Dallas. I remember having the conversation about what am I doing? This kid was All-Rookie as a center.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I started him that next game, probably around December 12th, year two, and that's when our team took off. He became the focal point of everything we did. We realized that we had a player that we could build an offense and a team and an organization around.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then you draft a guy like Jamal, the pieces that we've added and you get to where we are today. It was that San Antonio game that really stood out to me about the potential that he had.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,They weren't really battles. I won every game we played against them laughter.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"No, that Georgetown-Villanova rivalry goes back a long way and the respect that the two universities have for each other is awesome. The pros that they've both made. But just being able to have a guy who has been in the league now 16 years, a guy I played against in college, just kind of him going through his heart stuff, just to be able to see him have this opportunity on this stage and to be able to still be playing basketball at this high level is a pretty cool story for him. You just appreciate a guy like him for all the things he's been through and is still doing it at a high level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it was just something that it was a heated moment. It hurt a teammate of ours, and we wanted to have his back. At that time, we're always going to have our teammate's back in that moment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"But I don't think there's anything festering. We're at a different level. We understand that it's about winning four games right now. Anything that has happened in the past is things that we can't control right now. We've got to worry about winning basketball games, and that's all that really matters.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"Belief and trust in your coach, honestly, and belief in each other. Being able to switch from zone to man to whatever you want to, trap, double-team, doing different things. You've got to be able to have a sharp mind and be in the moment and say whatever Coach needs, I can do, will do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"It's just fun to be able to switch things up, change rhythms, because sometimes you've just got to do something different, which in Toronto we did that, and in Miami we're doing that now. We're switching up and doing different coverages, different things. And the versatility that we have on this team is pretty remarkable.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it will help a lot, but we've also got a head coach who's been doing it a long time, also, who has been here more than me. But I think just for me in this moment with these guys, I'll be able to help just kind of keep our focus, stay here. We've also got Udonis Haslem, who has been here, who has three rings, also.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think we're just prepared mentally to stay stable no matter what happens. It's kind of been our season the whole year, just being here and staying in the moment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"His personality is very different. He's one of a kind. But how he treats his teammates, he treats his friends, it's like no other. I think that's what helps us as a group.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"He may say some things or he may do some things that you might be like, oh, whoa. But it's coming from the best part of his heart.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"Because we're around him every single day, unfortunately, but fortunately. But being around him, you just get to learn the guy and learn his true love for the game and his true love for winning and for you as an individual.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"Man, you're aging me so bad. Max was still in high school.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"He used to embarrass me and Aaron Brooks in practice. Too fast, couldn't keep up with him. I ain't going to lie, I used to dislike having to go live practice against him. But if you go back and look at his journey and the things he's been through, to finally get to this point of getting to the Finals, I can't wait to just see him and say hello. Every time I see him, he'd still call me ""vet.""",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"He was just a good kid. Coming out of Wake Forest, wasn't the best shooter but could get anywhere on the floor at any time, any moment. He was always a special kid and a special guy.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,Sometimes you just have these stories that people should look into because his story is a very unorthodox story. I'm sure he's happy to be in this moment.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we just don't care about what others think. I think we do what we do no matter what. I think we work hard no matter the time, the place, the situation. I think we prepare ourselves, and we're well-prepared to go into any situation no matter where it is, what time, anything. We're prepared to do it.",,,,

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"2014, I believe as a team to Rio had a great experience, obviously playing with Andy Anderson Varejao who showed us a number of amazing things out there in Brazil.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"I think it all depends on who Denver puts out there and the matchups that are out there. As you saw in the Celtics series, they decided to go small. We started to match that, as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"We'll go over our game plan today, we'll see a lot of things that are going to stick out on film, a lot of things that we'll be able to do, who we'll be able to match up with.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"Denver is an extremely tough team. They're here for a reason. They're well-coached offensively and defensively. They're very sound, they stick true to their principles. They push the ball, they shoot the ball extremely well. Defensively they're there for one another.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"It's going to be a really hard-fought series. But Denver is a great place to play as well, so we're excited.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"I mean, it made perfect sense to me honestly. I obviously was eager, wanted to play, kept myself ready. At the same time those matchups, how they took Williams out of the starting lineup, decided to go small, that's how kind of it goes into matchups, that's how it works within the Playoffs.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"I felt I made my impact in at least the first two games, maybe one quarter before I had gotten hurt there. Again, just continued to be there for my teammates, be a vocal leader, keep it light between UD, Kyle and myself, just teach these guys, help them kind of grasp where we're at, as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"I think the beauty of it is you get to reset the deck, figure out what the matchups are going to look like in this series. Again, this is a great group to be a cheerleader for.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"It's an amazing thing. It's what you play for. As a player, being a competitor as well, what it's all about. But I do think being here with a different team and with the Miami Heat, just such a storied franchise with so much rich history, I think it's very sweet being here for a fifth time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"I mean, I don't think that's something we're really focusing on. I just think we just wanted to get here as early as possible after that Game 7 victory. More than anything, just rest our bodies, be ready to go.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,Last guy on the Heat I would let babysit my kids? I don't know. Everybody's pretty damn responsible. Probably Nikola Jovic just because he's so damn young. That's the only thing I can think of. He's still a child himself. That would be tough.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"I mean, hopefully we'll deliver a championship soon thereafter. That would be a nice way to send him off. I told him, it wasn't in the script for us to lose Game 7 in Boston because he wasn't going out like that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"UD is so special for this organization. It shows you that vets really do matter, 20 seasons, for an organization, in a place where he grew up, is truly a special thing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"Yeah, I mean, he's going to go down as one of the greatest big men to ever play the game. He just continues to impress and just beyond the statistical output that he has, the impact he has on the game, how he does it, how he operates, what we've seen, in a lot of ways is unprecedented.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"He's not a guy you're going to stop. You just have to hope to stand him down, continue to make things really tough for him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KEVIN LOVE,"He's extremely smart, manipulates the game. I mean that in a basketball IQ sense. Can get anything done how he wants to do it, where he wants to go. That's going to be a full team effort to just slow down what he's capable of doing, but again, easier said than done.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"It was fine. Nine days is a very long time, especially when you're every other day here. Okay, like maybe we find out who we play tonight, maybe we don't. Obviously, we found out two days ago or so.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"I think during this nine days, we were able to be smart about managing -- continuing to stay sharp, staying in good shape, but also get the ability to rest that a lot of what's needed as a team. Somehow find a balance and take advantage of that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Because he cares a lot. He's a competitor at heart. We can see the fight and tenacity that he has. He wants to win just as much as we do, and I think when you have a guy like that at the helm it's very important, and it's contagious to the players, and I think we all kind of rub off on each other. He can see what we're fired up and he's ready to go. When you've got guys like Ish who just come in and try to bring the morale down laughter, it's great, but we have other guys that are very positive.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Oh, man, I've played against Reggie for a lot of years when he was at OKC, when he was in Detroit, and I always hated Reggie just because he was such a--. I'm being honest as a competitor, because he's such a good player. He's able to get downhill, he's a great shooter. He also can find guys. Him being able to kind of cut your defense apart was very annoying.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"With him being on our team and him playing in spurts, whether he plays or not, I think that his knowledge of the game and him being able to help guys, I think that has been beneficial to a lot of our guards, and our energy has just been great, and I think guys like Ish and Jeff have done the same thing, and we really pick each other up out there, so that's great for our team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"You know what? That's a great question. I think for me, it's something that I practice a lot. I just wanted to go and try to learn from people smarter than me and peers about the subject that I was already kind of diving into on my own.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Basketball and everyday life, life is kind of a roller coaster, it's up and down, the emotions are high, stress level. I just wanted to be able to be able to find a better way to manage that throughout the course of my life on and off the floor.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Yeah, I mean, when you kind of see greatness like his every day, you kind of get used to it. It's kind of bad to say that, but we'll come in after games and like KCP had 20 points and Bruce off the bench, 17 points, nine rebounds, it's great, Nikola, another 30-point triple-double. It's kind of like, we've said that about 65 times, so it kind of gets repetitive after a while. You kind of start to just take it as normal when it really isn't normal for somebody to do that throughout the course of the season, throughout the Playoffs, shoot at such a high percentage and be okay when he's not shooting the basketball. He's such a selfless player.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Jamal, Mike, whoever, Aaron, KCP, he's going to feed those guys. Sometimes we have to force him to shoot the basketball, which is crazy to think about. When you have a guy like that who is the head of the snake of the team, it's kind of -- it's great to be a part of that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"I knew he was good. Just every night like that, that's great to see. I'm just glad to be a part of it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,DeANDRE JORDAN,"I think that's the thing. We've got a group of guys who are varied. We've got some great veterans, we've got a guy in KCP who's won a championship, who's been there, Jeff, myself, Ish, who have been in a ton of playoff runs with different teams, and some young guys who kind of keep it light and fun.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,Thank you.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't even know. Back in the days, I don't remember to be honest. Maybe I remember when Dallas won the championship, Miami. I remember San Antonio winning it. But then, to be honest, I don't even remember the opponents.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It was Miami-San Antonio, right, in Miami when Ray Allen hit that big shot? I remember that one. To be honest, I don't remember. I remember recently when I got in the league, but I don't remember when I was growing up because it was a really hard to follow, to be honest, first. Then I was not really -- I was following your league and your basketball.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Of course. I think everybody did that. Even Cody Wise probably did that. Three, two, one, trying to make a shot. Everybody did that probably in the life smiling.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it's not Bam against me or whatever, whoever. It's Denver against Miami. Just because I think we kind of have a similar play style, we are getting everybody involved. We like to play team basketball.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,It's not going to be me against him or anybody against anybody. It's going to be a Miami against a Denver. I think that's why it's going to be interesting.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I think I cannot say that, but someone who is older can, who remembers, just knowing them or watching them play.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But yes, Radivoj Korac is from my hometown, but I don't know, can really be compared or whatever. I think that's somebody older who remembers them, who did something probably in the basketball in Yugoslavia or Serbia or whatever.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,But that's a good question. Thank you.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Model my game probably, yes, yes. Probably he's one of the best power forward players that play the game. He did with such a ease, it's really, really -- I remember when he play against me, he was little bit older, but he still gave me the easiest 20 points ever in life probably. He always had a counter, but he was so patient. I think he's a great player to look up to, to model your game to him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,We going to see tomorrow smiling.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But, yes, we were waiting. I think we took a good, professional approach to those eight days, nine days, 10 days, whatever it was. Just because it's actually long break, you know, I think we did a good job. We stay in the shape getting ready, staying sharp, but still get enough rest.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But about the opponent we going to see tomorrow, is that true or I'm lying.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He was playing in the same team that I played back in Serbia. One of his coaches was my Godfather who work there. He told me I think year before he's going to get drafted that he's actually really good player, really good person, that he's really working hard, can have a talent to be NBA player.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"So, I know him before I actually met him little bit. I never watch him play, to be honest. Just little highlights, but never like a full game, whatever.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But he needs to say that. Whats he's going to say? I don't want to meet him smiling. Yes, good guy, good person. I saw he's getting bigger, so we're going to see if he's going to get opportunity to play. But I believe he will. He has a lot to offer.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,I'm confused.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's hard to say because sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not. I'm cool with that. I think everybody else are good with that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think the way how he play, everybody can step up, everybody can be a best player in one game or whatever, week, whatever.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't know, can I say myself as the best. The ball is in my hands a lot, so I make a lot of decisions. But I don't know if can be the best player.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we are not the favorite. I think in the Finals there is no favorites. This is going to be the hardest game of our life, and we know that. We are prepared for that. We are prepared for that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"So, I think there is no favorites. Definitely I think we are not favorites in this series. I think they're not either. I think it's just the Finals. There is no favorites in the Finals, in my opinion.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,You're going to see tomorrow.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But we saw the zone. Definitely we didn't see this kind of zone because they are switching zones and they're really, really messing up the game in their favor. We just need to be focused and solid in what we are doing because that's why they are great, that's why they are winning, that's why they're in the Finals. They're messing the game in their way, and they're doing that really good.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know how it's going to affect me. We see tomorrow. Maybe going to have 10 turnovers, maybe going to have 10 points. We will see. Other assists.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Thank you, guys.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"Yes, I am glad to be home. I am on the best team in the NBA, I believe, and yeah. Hopefully you all enjoy the series as much as I plan to.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"It's great. It's been 11 years removed for myself being in the Finals, just exciting especially to be at home and be part of this team. Just feel blessed to be welcomed where I was when I came over. We're glad that it's finally here. It's been a long time waiting.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"Yeah, a different appreciation. I think I appreciate them all. You just try to live in the moment and enjoy it, but yeah, being a little bit older and being removed so long, a little bit different appreciation for it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"I wasn't sure what team I'd be playing for, but I thought I'd be playing in the NBA Finals every year, so I'm just blessed to be in my second one in my 12 seasons. I know how few and far in between they come, so I'm just thankful.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"No, no such thing as leveling up. Great quote You do not rise to the level of the occasion, you sink to the level of your training. I think that's all that shows. Usually, the best players in usually every sport, the best at their craft usually last because they put the work in, so we get to see minor fruits of their labor, but we don't get to see their complete true excellence because, like I said, you sink to the level of your training.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"These guys have been putting in the work all day they're showing, and they've been playing amazing. This team has been playing amazing. I'm proud and I'm blessed to be part of it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,I've got a series to figure it out.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"Special. It's special. Their connection is amazing. They've been together for an amount of years. They've played each other's positions growing up, so I think just having the spectrum of Jokic starting from one, growing up and now being a five, playing like a point-center, and having Jamal starting as a big and now he's a point guard, going through that spectrum, I think they get to see the game in so many different ways. Like I said, they were special already coming in years ago, so getting to see their continuity and how it's built is just amazing. It's hard to stop. It's been fun. It's been tough playing against it in my career, and it's been fun now being a part of it and watching.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,I definitely rep 719. I'm from Earth.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"It just prepared me for the NBA life, moving every two, three years when you're traded. Hearing the rumors, it doesn't really faze you. You've been the new kid your whole life, so you find solace in being yourself and being alone.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"It's been fun. They had a good season. Yeah, I don't know if the NBA is going to be making too much money off of me buying seats.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"It's been fun to watch. It's been fun to watch. I think he leads through action, leads through example by the way he comes in and prepares each and every day.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,REGGIE JACKSON,"Extremely great basketball mind, so he implements himself at times being the coach by what he sees on the court. He doesn't do too much, he just strives, I think, for excellence, and he just holds people accountable.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"It feels amazing to be here. I always dreamed about this as a kid, so it's going to be fun. Nobody gave us a shot, but we knew we could get here somehow, some way. So, excited to be here.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Like I said before, it feels amazing. I'm going to say that word a lot, obviously, ""amazing."" Everybody had different journeys getting here. Everybody got here with different paths. But now that we're here, we're excited to be here. I'm excited to be here. Just ready. Ready to play.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Game 7 is one of the best two words in the NBA. It was a great game against the Celtics. I dreamed of playing in Game 7s growing up both when I was younger, so it's pretty cool. I'm glad we got the win, but it's past us now and now we're focused on the Nuggets.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, they see something in us that nobody else saw in us as undrafted guys, kind of like hidden gems. They believe in us, and they do a great job with developing us and taking us up under their wing and just making us be the best players we can be. They just do a great job all around.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm a junior, so it was my father's name. You'd have to ask his father, but he's not alive right now. I don't know the story behind it, honestly.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I've heard it's like an old name. I've heard it's a last name, too. So yeah, I don't know. I'm a junior. I don't know the story behind it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"My father is from Kingsville, Maryland, so it's like Baltimore County.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, we have no concern at all. No excuses around here. We still feel fresh. We got two days off after Game 7, so we've got no excuses from us at all.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I wasn't in the bubble, so I can't really speak from my personal experience how it was. But I'm pretty sure it was not the same, playing in front of fans, just playing in the type of environment, like Mile High City or Miami where it's going to be. It's going to be fun. It's going to be exciting. A lot of energy in the building, so it's definitely going to be different than the bubble.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,Good. Good. Excited. Excited about the opportunity. Great to be back here in the Finals. Looking forward to it.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,"No, I kind of just figured I'd take it one year at a time. You know what I mean? Stay in shape, work hard, let my body communicate with me about how long I can do it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,"I think now I see the leadership. I see the culture. I see everything. When you watch Bam, when you watch Max, you watch Gabe, they don't need me any more. You know what I'm saying? You saw it in the Finals. You saw these guys grow up right in front of your eyes.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,"I have been part of the process, I know what they put in to get to this point. But I think the world has seen those guys grow up right in front of their eyes. My work is done as a leader.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,"No, no. The impact that I have with these guys is because I'm not a coach, because I can practice with these guys, because I can go through the drills, because I can go through the grueling hours, understand all of that. That's why I have the impact.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,"The reverse part of that, what people don't understand, if I'm out of shape, not capable of keeping up, they don't listen to me. I have been able to set the tone, compete at a high level for these guys to understand or respect what I'm saying.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,"Enjoy it. Enjoy it, man. Enjoy this moment. That was one of my messages in the last series. If we get over this hump, you guys have no idea how enjoyable that next round will be.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,"I'm at this point in my career, just this point in my life, where I think memories are the most valuable things you're going to have. I've had the money, all these different things. None of that really matters. I think memories are priceless and I want these guys to create as many memories as possible right now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"Man, what it takes? Dedication, passion, sacrifice. You got to do the right things to be in this position obviously. You got to be for the team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"I think all those qualities UD has. He's shown me those qualities. That's why I'm in the position today. He's been a good mentor, friend of mine for a while. Watching him from afar, seeing how he's went about his business.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"Also, I live in Miami, so seeing his work from afar. Studying that allowed me to get in this position. I just took it and put it to my use, now I'm in the position I am in today. I just try to relay that message to the young guys to be in this league for a long time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"I seen a lot of growth in there, maturity obviously. When we were in Orlando together, he was young, still trying to find his footing in this league. But now I see, like I said, a much more mature Aaron who is simplifying his game, not trying to do too much but be effective in his pursuit of the game, letting the game come to him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"I think his defense has been tremendous. I think his focus is starting there, and he's allowing that to carry over to the offensive end.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"Aaron, he's a workaholic. He's somebody that has worked on his game a lot to get to this point. He's a big X factor for us, what he brings to this team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"I've seen a lot of growth in him wanting to be in this position. For me, I think he's one of the best two-way players in this league. I don't think he get enough credit for that. He deserves to be where he's at right now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"I won those, by the way.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"I love Kyle to death, man. He's been a good friend of mine. He's somebody who is a true competitor. Like you say, since college. Like I said, I won a lot of those games.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JEFF GREEN,"He brings the best out of you. He's going to guard, compete to the high level. I've been loving his game ever since college, since he got in the league, how he plays, his approach to the game. I think I have a good record against him, so I got to keep that going.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"My bigger brother has been there every step of the way. We battled on the basketball court, on and off the floor. And he is just somebody that has been so solid and kept it so real with me from day one.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,I cant even really answer that in just such a short amount of time. I would need so much time to elaborate on how my big brother has been there and shaped my life and shown me what to do and what not to do. How to move. How to act. How to hold yourself. Made me tough. Big bro made me tough when it comes down to it.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"I dont know. What would you suggest? I guess just play fast. Play for all 48 minutes. Yeah, just play faster.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"Always be deeply present. I think that is a reward in its own right. Just be in the moment, enjoying this, regardless of the outcome, regardless of what happens. Just being present with my brothers out there battling, attempting to bring how a championship.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,Staying out of foul trouble is going to be really crucial. Jimmy does a great job of seeking contact and getting the refs to make a decision.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"I've said it before, I'll say it again I think out of everybody that you mentioned, I think Jimmy could potentially be the most complete player out of those guys. That's saying a lot. As far as the offensive package, the defensive package, the in-between too -- the transition, the cuts, the offensive rebounds. He can shoot the three. He can make the three. He can make the middie. He can get to the cup. And he does it through 48 minutes. He is a difficult cover, for sure.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"To stay out of foul trouble is huge. Jimmy is also a really smart player. I know he's going to try to get the switch a lot so I'm not the primary defender. I'm just going to do my best to make it difficult with him. Use my size, continue to use my physicality and use my speed.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"That is my brother. Jeff is my big bro. We played in Orlando together. Different opportunity, different circumstances.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"Coming back together, this organization has been a blessing. Just to see eye-to-eye, relearn each other, just know that you have a brother in the locker room, for real.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"He gives me little advice and tidbits here and there, texts before the games. It's just all encouraging. Just the belief that we have in each other is amazing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"I used to watch Jeff Green growing up. I've always been a fan of his game forever. He's an incredible talent. Just an awesome dude to have on the floor and in the locker room, as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"That's a real thing, a reoccurring theme in my life. Just overworking to the point of diminishing returns smiling.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"It's like working so much to the point where now it's game time and now I have a nagging injury or a nagging ailment or something like that. I'm finally taking the needle off of that broken record. I've conserved enough energy, made sure I stayed in the right rhythm.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"That's how I've always been, been a workhorse. I try to be the hardest-working player on the team, which is hard in this organization. There's a lot of really hard workers. Not an easy task.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"Now it's just about trusting the work that I have put in from that point, from before that, up until now. Like I said before, just the presence, the moment, letting it all go.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"Jimmy is not like a crazy talker. He doesn't talk too wild. I think he talks, if you start with him, if he gets rolling, he might start chirping a little bit.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"I think what gets under people's skin about Jimmy is his calm and collectedness. Through 48 minutes, he's very poised and he's very calm. I think that's really what irks other people.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"Not long at all. Didn't take me long at all. It's an amazing luxury for a center, for Nikola, big fella like himself, being able to just see the floor. He sees everything on the floor, everyone before it even happens.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,"If you double-team, he can pass over the top of the double team. He can pass with his left hand, right hand, off a spin. He always keeps the defense off balance. You always have to be ready to shoot, ready to score. That's one thing that I've learned.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,AARON GORDON,It was almost like clockwork when I came in because I love to play like that. I love to cut. I love to get out of the defender's vision and make him pay for that. So it's been a blessing.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Been preparing all week. Just getting treatment, getting our bodies ready to go tomorrow.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But just trying to get through this day as quickly as possible, try to stay focused on what's at task. That's four more wins to be NBA champions.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, they've been doing pretty much a great job of that themselves. For me, it's all about just we've been sitting for a long time. We're going to be a little bit jittery, anxious to play. Just trying to keep them calm, knowing the first couple possessions are going to be a lot, even for myself.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm feeling anxious right now to even get out there. But just try to keep them calm, stay focused on what's at task, like I said.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, this is my third playoff appearance.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I've seen it before. It can happen. You can slip into just getting comfortable because there's that many days off.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But for us, it was more just getting in the gym, doing something, even if were not practicing, just doing treatment, free throws, shots, whatever it is, just to get out of the house, do something.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It works for us. We focus, were ready. Just excited for tomorrow.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Every series we play, they are tough opponents. They play hard regardless of what it is. This Miami team, just by watching them throughout the Playoffs, theyre relentless. They dont give up. They are going to play 48 minutes and we have just got to be prepared for it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"The bubble wasnt bad. Like you said, no media there, no nothing, just basketball, which was exciting as well. But being here, able to have the fans and everyone here, doing media. This is exciting as well too, because I didnt get a chance to experience the media aspect and play in front of thousand of fans screaming. Like I said earlier, Im excited and just happy to be here in this moment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah, when they went up 3-0, we thought the series was done. But Boston is a great team and they fought back tremendously from 3-0 to tie the series up. We didnt know who we were going to get at that point once Boston started winning so we just started preparing for both teams.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Guarding him as a team with all five guys. He does everything so well, and we're going to have to be in the gaps, we're going to have to gang rebound. We can't have defensive lapses. We're just going to have to get after it. I think at the end of the day, he's a major key, as DJ Khaled would say, and we're going to have to lock in.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Because we do it every single day, and we know what we're capable of. The outside individuals don't get the opportunity to see that, and I wish that y'all did because then you would see that the guys that we have on this team, on this roster, can really play some high-level basketball, and we're going to stay confident because, like I said, we're in the grind every single day.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Guys have been out of the lineup all year long, guys step up, fill in, and do their job. We're never going to be surprised.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think so. I think there's a lot of, like, stuff about the whole situation that people don't understand, and I'll let that stay back there. But I don't think it has too much to do with anything, this thing in the past. It's high-level competition. But I will say I wasn't talking to Jokic. That wasn't my beef. Make sure you write that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,The individual who I was talking to definitely knew who I was talking to.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"I'm just -- I would like to say that I'm never rattled. I'm very calm. I'm very consistent in everything that I do, whether it's before the game, after the game, during the game, and I think when my guys look at me like that, they follow suit in every single way.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"I love that about them because they're never shook. No matter what. We could be down, people can think that we're out, and all of a sudden we're right back in this thing and it's because we do the same thing every day. We love being around each other. We want to see each other succeed. We really do enjoy when each other play well, and we're going to continue to do that, never going to get rattled, and we're going to see where we end up.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"So many of my former teammates have shaped me into this, quote-unquote, leader that you think that you see in front of you today. Not perfect or anywhere near it in any way, but I'm me. My style of ""leadership"" works here.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"But more than anything, I've got to give a shout-out to D-Wade because he had always told me about the culture here and how it fits who I am, what I'm about and how I go about things. You see it everywhere it really is a match made in heaven. I love it here, and I hope to be here.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"None of that. I was never that good at basketball growing up anyways, so me being in the NBA was so far out that I didn't think I would make it this far. I'm glad that I am here and I have the opportunity to do that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Maybe I'll hit a game winner like D-Wade. I think that would be really good. I'm not standing on no tables, but it would be really good to be D-Wade for a day.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, we didn't have cable.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's my guy, my brother forever. I miss him so much. I used to spend so much time here with him, watching him be great. He motivated me because his story is really, really incredible. Through everything that he's been through, to make it and do what he did for the Broncos. I actually have a lot of love for this city.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Like I said, I miss that guy. I wish he was here to sit courtside and watch me do my thing because we talked about this all the time, maybe not Denver versus my team, but just being able to watch me win a championship like he did.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yes, he'd better be there. So Ney, I know you're looking somewhere. You'd better be there. But that's my guy, too.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Part of my routine on game days and off days is I watch all types of sports of people who inspire me to be great. He's one of them. So, I've probably seen each one of his highlight videos on YouTube way too many times, Sasha Alexander Zverev tennis, Carlito Carlos Alcaraz tennis, you go down -- Serena, everybody. I love greatness in any way that you view it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"He's obviously a close friend of mine, so I pay attention to him a lot. But with him in my corner, I think I'll be okay.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, I just be drinking some water, listen to some music. I think that's the formula, you've just got to listen to music, drink water, drink wine, play Spades and dominos.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Before Game 1, probably Dermot Kennedy honestly. He be having me grooving. Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Lauryn Hill, Kirk Franklin. You never know. But it's going to be something. Spice Girls. Laughter.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, I'm not going to lie. I'm going to say nobody cares. You don't, either. I'm still expected to do my job at a high level if I take the floor, which I will.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"We're going to be okay. We're going to get the job done, bum ankle or not, and I'm not taking a follow-up, so don't do that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"Honestly, I haven't seen paid attention to it just yet. I haven't lied to you. I've got a lot of time between after this media session and the game to really lock in on what I'm going to do to help this team win on both sides of the ball. But I'm going to play the right way.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,JIMMY BUTLER,"If I'm not open, I'm going to pass the ball. I'm going to try to collapse the defense and create help, kick it to my open shooters, play basketball the right way, and know that this teams way of playing basketball is going to win it for us.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, my time at Miami was great. Coach L was one of the greatest coaches I've had. His practices were set up for me to get to the league. It was just like the league PD, then we'd get into our shell drill, stuff like that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"I loved my time in Miami with him, as I said. I can't wait to see him when we get down there. He actually texted me.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, he's extremely important. He was one of the reasons why I came. He told me exactly the role I was going to play. When I didn't see it, he saw it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"Without Jeff, I don't know if I would have been here or not. On and off the court, as I said, Jeff, when he was in Brooklyn, he was huge for me, just my mental and for the team. Him and D.J. have been great vets, just the way they carry themselves. They know how to be serious, when to make people laugh.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"They've been great. They've been amazing. Actually I think, what, second series, I forget who we were playing, the Suns or something. I was a little tired coming out. Then I ran out, I heard the roar. I was good, I was ready to go.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,I know it's going to be crazy in here Game 1 and Game 2. I can't wait for us to start tomorrow.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"I definitely enjoyed it. I was talking smack in the locker room. You heard it all year -- Kansas is better than Miami, all these guys, whenever they went. I was screaming at the TV. I watched every game. Super excited for those guys.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"I worked out there all last summer, so I was around them a little bit. I was just super proud of them.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it's great. I was talking to my people yesterday. I was like the last time I won something was in high school. So just to have the chance to be here at the highest level is just amazing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,I think we're ready. We've been there before. We've had a long break during All-Star. I think we'll be fine. There's no worries there.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"There was no advice. He just said, See you in Miami. I texted him back, I'll see you there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"He's been texting me throughout the year saying congratulations, good luck, you've finally shown what you can do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"Coming into league, people were asking what position I would play. He said point guard. Not a lot of people believed that. As I said, I love Coach L.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it would be great. I try to bring my winning ways everywhere I go, play extremely hard. Now to be the first time in Denver Nuggets history to reach the Finals, to be able to win, that would be insane. Hopefully we can do that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, I played them a lot coming from the Eastern Conference. They play extremely hard. They pack the paint a lot, so we're going to have some open threes that we need to knock down. We've done that this year against them.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,Bam is an extremely good defender. They might switch him three to five. They're not going to switch with Duncan. We know what we need to do.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"From Dorchester, by the way smiling.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"But, yeah, there's not many people from Dorchester, Massachusetts, who make it on this level and be able to play at a good level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BRUCE BROWN,"It is crazy to take it all in. I haven't thought too much about it. I'm sure I'll think about it a lot after the series. But now, yeah, it's crazy.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, it's been great. Obviously to your point with Remy, he's a great dude, and winning with him was fun. Just these however last many months it's been, it's been a good experience. Got to learn a lot, got to win a lot. Obviously, this is the biggest goal, though, and we're close to getting there, but we've got a long ways to go.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think it's a big deal for opposing teams especially. It's a big deal when you get here and getting used to it, but we've been here resting and waiting for enough days to get used to it, so I think it's a big deal for opposing teams to come in here and try to play at the pace we play for that long, especially in the Playoffs when guys are playing 45 minutes. It's hard for teams to keep up with our pace for that long.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Well, in my time on the court, I try to be as high energy as possible, and especially in the Playoffs. It's not as long. Just try to have energy, and I don't think that stuff at this point of the year affects you as much.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, it's been smooth. I think the Nuggets have really let me be me, and that's a big part of it. But the transition is different. There's a lot of things that are different. Preparation is different. Then just stepping into a higher level of basketball is different.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think KU obviously helps you as much as you could possibly be helped, and then being there for a couple extra years also helps, playing at a National Championship level also helps.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's a lot of things that help you, but there's not much that can prepare you for this moment and these moments, but if there was a player that was prepared, I think it would be me.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I've talked to him a little bit. He hasn't been able to get out here for a game yet, but my brother just committed there, to play his last year, so I've talked to him a little bit about that, too. He's a great guy, and I love him to death. He's done a lot for me, and I talk to him as much as I can.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Man, he's great. Like his dedication to his craft, how he's bounced back from injury, no excuses, no complaints, comes in here every day, come back at night, he's in here again. Just his dedication to his craft and just the way you've seen him overcome injuries and things like that, and he's not playing at a normal level. He's playing at the highest level, and probably better than he's ever been in his career.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Just to see a guy work that hard and then to be through what he's been through, it's great to see his success.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Me and him are pretty close. We talk a lot in the locker room. Just to see his success is great for me, and we all really enjoy it when he's playing well, and the Nuggets are at their best when Jamal is playing his best, so I really enjoy watching him play.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Well, I think he said a couple quotes in the last couple weeks, just like how much his family means to him. So, off the court, he's a big family man. Obviously, his daughter is a big part of his life, his wife. Just the way he treats people off the court, the way he treats his family I think is something that everybody can take away from him. Just a great guy, a genuine guy, and a guy that's obviously great at basketball.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You can take a lot of things from him, but obviously those are things off the court you can definitely take from him is how caring, how genuine he is to the people around him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"Tough shots, difficult shots. Trying to get him in an uncomfortable zone and force him to take tough shots.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"Make him take tough shots, force him into tough shots, and live with the result. That's the biggest thing for me.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like this is one of those series where he becomes very dangerous when you let his teammates get involved, and he can make those incredible passes and end up with 12 assists.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, we've definitely had moments in this run where people thought we couldn't do it. People thought we weren't going to make this, weren't going to do that. You know, when you've got the trust in your 15, the coaching staff and whoever is getting on that plane with you, when everybody believes and has a trust, I feel like you can do anything.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"If it ends in a win, it doesn't matter. You can talk about stats, you can talk about this guy did that, did this and that. But you know at the end of the day, they're going to remember the people who won.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,My mom. I know I talk about her a lot. I hope she doesn't call me during media.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"But it's been my mom because she's been a leader in my life, since I've been born. Seeing my mom go through every adversity, all the adversity she's been through, my mom walked to work, my mom was a single parent, we lived in a single wide trailer. I lived off of 12,000 a year from my mom. Having that type of person lead, I feel like it was just bound for me to be able to get in that mold.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"Definitely uncomfortable when you first start being -- when people start looking at you and saying you have to be more vocal, you have to be a leader of the ship. I just look back at those days how my mom just lived for me, and it was by example.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"I've always had that will to lead by example, but every moment in the moments of truth, I'll take the chair, and it counts for whatever it counts for, maybe once or twice a game, just depending on it. I feel like it's by example, and I'm the person that if you're going through something, I will come to you and talk to you.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,Everybody has their different versions.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"A lot. I feel like that's been the biggest thing in a lot of series, not letting me be comfortable in the paint, get to my spots. So biggest thing for me is just watching film, making adjustments, and figuring it out.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, the swagger Caleb plays with. That's my biggest thing, because when he got here, he was truly quiet. Like Caleb was one of those people, he's like, it's like a morning person that doesn't talk in the morning, but he was like that all day. Laughter.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"We'll be in practice and he'll maybe say three words, and the only reason he'll say those three words to me is because I've known Caleb since we've been in high school.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"Now seeing him communicate, talk, really be himself on the court, express himself, I feel like that's the biggest -- those are the biggest steps I've seen him make, and I'm truly proud of him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,BAM ADEBAYO,"I really look at film, not really analytics. But I definitely do watch film, look at tendencies, look at plays, see if I can see hand motions to see what types of plays they're running. Just the little things, the little details that you don't look at throughout a game, I try to find the little things in the film.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, as I told our team, forget the eight seed stuff. They beat Milwaukee 4-1. That team had the most wins in the NBA this year. They beat Boston 4-3 and they were up 3-0, the team with I think the second most wins in the NBA this year.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"So, you get to the NBA Finals, it's not about seeding anymore, and for those who are thinking that this is going to be an easy series, I don't even know what to say to you people. This is going to be the biggest challenge of our lives. This is the NBA Finals. You're trying to win the first NBA championship in franchise history, and it's going to be the hardest thing that we've ever done, which is the way it should be.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But regarding the themes, obviously a couple things that jump out to me, they're leading the league, the Playoffs rather, in points off turnovers, close to 20 a night, and that's after, I think, 18 games played. So, it's pretty impressive.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"On the other end of that is that we're No. 1 in fewest points allowed off of our turnovers. So that's a battle that's going to be really important, and we can't turn the ball over.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"We know how good they are on the defensive end. We've had a great offense, in large part because we are shooting the ball well and we're not turning the ball over, so that's really important in terms of not beating ourselves with turnovers.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The three-point line, you have the two best three-point shooting teams in the Playoffs, in the Finals. They're just ahead of us at 39 percent. Obviously, Jimmy and Bam attract so much attention, but you have to give so much credit to Caleb Martin, Gabe Vincent. We know Duncan Robinson is a great shooter, we know Max Strus is a great shooter. Tyler Herro will be back at some point. We know what he's capable of. Obviously, just been so impressed with Gabe Vincent, the poise and confidence he's playing with, and Caleb Martin could easily have won the MVP of that Eastern Conference championship. He's just shooting into a very big basket right now, playing with tremendous confidence, so the three-point defense will be really important in terms of us guarding that, and we've done a pretty good job of that throughout the regular season and the Playoffs.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"With a guy like Jimmy, you've got to give him different looks. You cannot guard him with the same play or the same scheme over a game, over four quarters or a series. That's going to be a challenge to give him different looks and to keep him off the foul line.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's third in the Playoffs in free throw attempts per game. I think they're at 9.1. We know a lot of their guys are real big shot fake players, so they're disciplined to stay down, be the second man off the floor. Give them one shot it's going to be really important.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I would say is that we have to continue to get out and run. We're second in the Playoffs in fast break points per game. In our two head-to-head meetings, we only averaged nine and a half fast break points against them, which is our third lowest against our 29 opponents.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Getting pace, getting fast break, getting attack, getting altitude into this series while home will be really important.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've gone on record countless times, and I'll do it again. I feel really fortunate and blessed to be working in an organization run by Stan and Josh Kroenke. They gave me a chance eight years ago to lead this team, and the most important part of this last eight years is their ability to be patient and have a big-picture approach and let this thing grow into what it is today.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"That is not normal in pro sports, not just the NBA. In all my conversations with Stan and Josh, they've won Super Bowls, they've won Stanley Cups. They've been around some great teams, great players. But I also know that they're basketball people. Josh was a hell of a player in his own right, and Stan will tell you he grew up a basketball fan.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is the one thing that is missing from their trophy case, and that's what motivates every one of us when we come into work every day is to bring home that first championship for this city, for our fans, for the Kroenkes, for our players, and we know we have a hell of a fight in front of us.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, you could get into the basketball, the skill level. For me, when I look at Jimmy Butler, what separates him from most players is the drive, the competitive spirit within him, a relentless attack.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"It was really cool seeing the press conference they showed from last year when they lost and how everything he talked about in that moment kind of came to fruition a year later, and he has this team back in the Finals.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think what makes Jimmy hard to guard is we know he's talented, he's big, he's strong, he can get to his spots on the court, but he has the gift of drawing fouls and getting to the free throw line. But he's a big-moment player. He's not scared. He's tough. He's relentless, and he's a warrior.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's why from the first -- from the Play-In games to that first-round series against a really good Milwaukee team with great defensive players, like Jrue Holiday said, it didn't matter who was guarding him, Jimmy was going to get where he wanted to go.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,It's not just on Aaron Gordon it's on all five guys on the floor to try to slow him up and to give him different looks. We'll be ready.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I mean, you see it all throughout the season when teams come in here. The altitude is real. I think they got in late last night, so they're going to try to acclimate as quickly as possible.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's somebody that embodies our culture, and the beginning of that is work. Self-motivated players.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,Thanks for listening and paying attention.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think that's a great question and an interesting one because three, four years ago, the number one pick-and-roll combo in the entire NBA was Nikola and Jamal, and most people would just assume that it was Nikola setting for Jamal. It was actually the opposite. It was Nikola handling and Jamal setting.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The reason it was so effective, aside from the obvious, two really talented players, is that Jamal is big, strong, physical, and not afraid of contact. Some guys like to slip out of every screen because they don't want to make that contact, they don't want to give themselves up. Jamal from early in his career here, he's shown that he's willing to go and set a screen on a big guy, small guy, doesn't matter, because he's tough.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, the second part of that is he also knows that if Nikola has the ball and he screens, his man has to help, which will give him separation. If you want to simplify the game of basketball, it comes down to separation. The great individual players, the great offensive teams find ways to create it, and the great one-on-one defenders and the great teams find a way to negate it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Jamal realizes when he sets great screens, whether it's on Nikola or anybody else, that's going to allow him to maybe create some separation and pop for a jump shot or a drive, and Nikola, Aaron and Jamal have really good synergy within that three-man game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think it definitely is a delicate balance in that regard. But for me, it's just getting back to work, and we've had a great week of practice leading into today. It was nice to finally know who we were playing so we could speak about a lot more detail and specifics with the Miami Heat and their personnel and their coverages and their plays.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But for our guys having been off as long as we have been, I think we're just excited to play again, and it happens to be in the NBA Finals, which is pretty cool. But the message all along has been, yes, enjoy it, enjoy this city. Last time we had this we were in the bubble. We didn't get a chance to experience any of this. We were all the way down in Orlando.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But also, don't get bored with success and don't listen to everybody telling you how great you are because we haven't accomplished anything yet, and we're playing against a team that has been playing every other day, and they're on a mission, we're on a mission, and that's why it's going to be a hell of a series.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Everybody that's been here in my eight years has been a part of this. You mentioned a guy like Tim Connelly I wouldn't be the head coach in Denver if it wasn't for Tim Connelly. He was here for seven of my eight years, and his fingerprints are all over this team. So yes, Tim Connelly is a part of it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You mentioned guys that have been on my staff. Everybody that's ever come in these doors and helped me, helped our players, helped this organization, they're a part of it. Every player from year one when I came in like Emmanuel Mudiay and Gary Harris and Kenneth Faried and Jusuf Nurkic and Wilson Chandler, Randy Foye, Danilo Gallinari. I could sit here and -- it's been a long list in eight years, man. But they're all a part of it. They helped us get here. You had to lay a foundation. You had to go through growing pains.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,The players in that locker room right now are reaping a lot of the hard work and sacrifice that those other players and coaches gave to this team and organization.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"So yes, this is for everybody that's come through here, and I love the fact that after one of the press conferences Jamal Murray unsolicited talked about Gary Harris, talked about Monte Morris, talked about the guys who were so instrumental in his early years here, and I think that's a great mindset let's not forget where we came from and give thanks to those that helped us get to this point.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, it's going to take a full team effort. It's not just on a starting five. We wouldn't be here in the NBA Finals if it wasn't for contributions from everybody, whether that's leading into practice, whether that's a guy like Thomas Bryant going out there and being the best version of Bam Adebayo as a scout team player, and I mean that sincerely. Everybody has got a job to do and do it to the best of your abilities.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But also look at the contributions of guys like Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, Christian Braun. Those have kind of been the three guys off our bench that we've played in our eight-man rotation, and each one of those players has had a huge impact in us being 12-3 at this point as we approach Thursday night and Game 1.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The other thing I'll say is in any given series, there's always curve balls. You never know who's going to play. Somebody who has not played a ton of minutes leading up to this point could be a guy that maybe helps us win a game, win a quarter, win a possession, and when you get to the NBA Finals, every possession matters.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,MICHAEL MALONE,We don't have just eight players on our team. We have 17 guys in that locker room that I love and care about and that are a part of us getting to this point of the season.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"Yes and no. I mean, a lot of things that -- it's more feeling and being in the moment. A lot of things you carry over to the Finals when the Finals start. For me I was stuck in the moment of just making it to the Finals instead of actually enjoying the moment of being there and playing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,But it's nothing you really take over. It's just about accepting where you're at and being prepared.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"A lot of respect. They've created a culture. It's their way. It works. They established something that's been beneficial to them, that's gotten them to places over and over and over that a lot of teams haven't.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"Much respect to them. Much respect to Spo, how he gives his guys confidence to go out there and produce no matter who's on the floor, and obviously Pat is Pat. He's been doing his thing in this league for a long-a-- time. You've got to give respect where respect is due.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"Honestly, I don't know what they're going to do. This is a question for them. I know we're prepared for what they bring to the table. You watch their game, and they play zone. They play hard-nosed man-to-man. They can play all different type of ways.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,But we have to make sure that we're prepared and we execute whatever we're trying to do.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, at the end of the day it's just about playing with effort. We did what we had to do in the Playoffs to get to this point, and that came with rest. Our job is to go out there and execute, play hard, and try to get the win.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"Rust, I don't think nobody on our team has even thought about it. I think Coach did a great job of making sure that we stayed well-conditioned through the practices that we had, and when the game time comes, everybody is going to get tired. Like we can't control that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,But our job is to go out there and play with effort and play with pace and play Denver Nuggets basketball.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, one scenario is just a lot of up-and-down. Probably one of those scenarios, 5-on-5 scenarios. That's pretty much it. Without giving you a long breakdown of every practice, high intensity, throwing every kind of scenario at us.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"All I can say is he did a great job, without going into too much detail.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"The adjustment of going from player to player, and it's not -- you just named three guys from each series, but Aaron has been guarding multiple guys each series. It's not just the guys that you singled out. He's been doing a good job of understanding the assignment of who he's guarding but also knowing personnel, if there's a switch, but I think he's been doing a tremendous job. He's part of the reason why we're here. It starts with defense, and he's the head of the snake on that defensive end and the pressure that he puts on their main guys.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"Our job is to try to make plays for each other, try to find open spots, just try to make the right reads. How they play with their zone, they do different things within their zone, obviously, so our job is just to be aggressive and make plays.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"Thank you, first of all. Great question. How do I look at my journey? Man, long story short, I'm proud of myself, from all the obstacles that I've been through in my career. Like you said, the obstacle that I faced 10-plus years ago, not allowing those type of things to hold me back, breaking barriers down, multiple teams, adapting to every circumstance.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"To be at this point, 16 years of my career, I'm happy. I'm excited. This is a blessing. It shows the hard work. Whether people want to look at it or not, with all I've been through, which everybody knows, to be at this point, being productive, giving something on a great team in the Finals, I think it's amazing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,I'm proud of myself on how I got to this point and accomplished some of the things I wanted to do.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"It's everything. This is what I play for. For me, I always play for team first, and ultimate goal was to always win a championship. It would be everything. Like I said, with everything I've been through in my career, to win a championship is everything, and for the city of Denver, same thing. I'm pretty sure that they're excited for this. Long-awaited for this moment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,JEFF GREEN,"We go out there, we play for the city of Denver, and we're going to give them everything we have in order to bring that championship home. We're looking forward to the opportunity.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Well, I came into the league as a defender. I tell all the young guys coming into the league, find a niche that is going to help you stay in the league, and my niche was defense. It's been there. I've been able to develop it and kind of fine-tune it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,But I'm most excited about just helping my team. I'm not really worried about showing the world anything. I do it for the guys that are in the locker room.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"If I can take on that task of guarding the best player night in and night out and make it easier for the guys around me so they can focus on their jobs, so be it every time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"It's not really about overhauling as much. It's just reading the game. These guys are such great players, such great players in this locker room and playing on the floor, that you just have to make the right read. You've got to be in the right spot every time and do what the game is asking of you. I've gotten to play in the dunker spot a lot, so that's what I love to do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"We've got the utmost respect for them. They fight and they scrap, and they have no quit in them. They play through 48 minutes a game and more if necessary. They play fearless. They play disciplined. They're well coached and have some guys that have been there before and have some guys that have chips on their shoulder.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"We're not looking at the seeding or the story around it. This is a very talented basketball team, professional basketball team, and all those guys over there got game. So we respect it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Oh, man, just how much I appreciate KCP and Brucie B. chasing around guards. Trying to guard a lot in that Warriors series between Klay and chasing around Steph a little bit and then switching to Draymond, there was just a lot. We got some defenders on this team, some two-way guys. It's nice to have those guys around and locked in on the defensive end.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Then just the physicality of the game, understanding that there's going to be some fouls that don't necessarily get called, but it cannot deter you from attacking the rim and attacking the game every single time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"A lot of drive-and-kick, a lot of drive-and-kick and a lot of slips. They work the clock. They use all 24 seconds of it to find the best shot.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"They play good to great. It's going to get you a higher percentage. They do that time in and time out. Every possession, they play good to great.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Oh, I mean, we've been working. It's not like we've got our feet kicked back or our hands back and our feet kicked up. We've been working. We've been locked in in the gym, working diligently.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,We feel like we're in a good space. It's been a good balance of work to rest. Happy we have home-court advantage.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Well, the altitude actually, it is an advantage. It plays a difference. I remember when I was in Orlando and coming to play against Denver, it was difficult just to get your first and second wind.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"But that team is full of fighters. That team is excuseless. They don't make excuses, and they will not use that as an excuse. Honestly, we're just going to play our game and try and run them and play the way that we know how to play.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"You always want to keep home court. So first and foremost, it's what we worked for all season long, to have that home-court advantage.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"But I've been telling my guys all year, we don't want the easy route. We don't want anything easy. We want to be great. Miami is the best team out of the East, and that's what we want.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Well, Jimmy is a difficult cover for different reasons than the guys I've guarded in the past like KD and LeBron, KAT. Jimmy does everything. He does all the intangible things. He gets out in transition. He gets cuts. He gets offensive rebounds. He gets backdoors. He gets spin-outs. He does a lot of the game within the game, as well as being really skilled. He's a difficult cover.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Just make it tough for him, play without fouling to the best of my ability and just compete. That's really what it comes down to.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"I think it's lethal because of their ability to score from all three levels. It's rare. It's really rare that you can have a guard and a big that can both shoot the three, both score in the mid range with the floater and attack the rim. It's very rare. You don't see it often at all.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Of course I watched the Finals. It's just an awesome feeling. It's amazing. I'm doing it for everybody that has ever helped me in my life, doing it for the people around me. And just proving us right.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"It's hard to put into words how amazing this experience is. Playing basketball at the highest level is a blessing, and I'm doing everything in my power to continue to receive those blessings for myself, my family and my team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"The key to going up against a zone is, well, good shooting. That always helps. If you've got some lethal shooters out there, you can shoot people out of the zone. Ball movement, patience, attacking the zone, the middle of the zone. Really, the middle of the zone. That's what unlocks it all. If you get in the middle of the zone, everything else kind of unlocks. Oh, yeah, offensive rebounding against the zone, as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, he's been going crazy. I don't really set targets for like points. I just want to make it as difficult as I possibly can for him all night long for 48, through an entire series. Just making everything that he gets tough. Make him work for everything. It's not like a one one-on-one. Basketball is a five-on-five game, and it's going to be a five-man defense out there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Just make him work and, like I said, just make it tough, not necessarily worry about the points. If he gets to his 27 mark but he takes however many shots, it's a win.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,30-May,AARON GORDON,"Just do what we've been doing all year Take care of our home floor. We've been great on our home floor all year long, and we don't expect that to change. We want to be disciplined through 48, have energy, play hard. If we can play smart for 48 minutes, I believe we'll come out of here with a W.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think really just keep our head down and stay focused. Took a couple days of rest and just watched these games. Know we could play either team. But no, just keeping our head down and staying focused until we get this ring.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, definitely try to take time to reflect and be grateful. I've been journaling, things like that. I try to do gratefulness journaling and just reflect during this journey on all the things there are to be grateful for, but at the same time just stay hungry, keep working, never let up. At the same time, you've got to take moments to reflect, I think. That makes it worth it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I think they're both really good teams in their unique ways. Boston is obviously very talented all the way through their whole roster. Got a lot of guys who can play. So you can't really take any of their guys lightly because they all are hoopers.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Miami is just very gritty. I think both teams are scoring around 20 points off of other teams' turnovers. We're emphasizing taking care of the ball and things like that. But they both present a unique set of challenges. We'll see tonight who we play. Neither team is a rollover. Obviously they're both very good teams, so looking forward to seeing who we play tonight.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think just the same as he's always been. I think all our guys are really doing the same things we always have. We just have everyone healthy at this point. I think that's really the big difference between now and previous years, is just health. But no one has changed who they are during the playoffs. No one has tried to do things they haven't done all year. I think really that's the key, was just all of us being healthy and being able to play as a group.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, I don't know. I wouldn't really say the word is like ""proud of."" I don't really look at myself like I've really made humongous leaps in any area. I still have a long ways to go.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I appreciate when people say that, but I definitely have a long way to go and a long way that I know that I can reach. I wouldn't really say that I look at anything from the past year and am excited about it. I just keep trying to get better every day.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think we've been pretty consistent as a team throughout the entire Playoffs. Every team we've played has been a little bit different Minnesota, then Phoenix, then L.A.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"The game plan has been a little different, where guys are getting their shots. But as a team, as a group, we've stayed pretty consistent and together through this whole thing. That's not going to change.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I mean, Trae, me and Trae Young have talked a lot. He's jealous since I'm in the Finals and he's only made the Eastern Conference Finals. We were talking about that in L.A.. He came to our last game in L.A.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"And then Brandon Roy, my coach from high school, yeah, he called me the other day and he pretty much was just criticizing everything that I was doing. I think he's jealous, too, because he never made it to the Finals.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But those two dudes.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"B-Roy still gives me lots of advice. He was my coach in high school, so he sees kind of how my game has evolved since my injuries and things. He gives me great advice as a good mentor to me. But I would say those two have been the ones that have been in touch the most.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"It's definitely been a long wait. It seems like we haven't played a game in forever. So we've just been trying to stay in shape, stay in the gym and just wait and see who we play. We thought we would have known a while ago, but the Celtics, they're making history right now. They're being very resilient. I'm very excited to see how tonight's game goes.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But we're not really hoping for either team because they're both great teams. We've just got to see what happens.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"That shot, that was one of the craziest endings to a game I've seen. Jimmy Butler getting fouled on that three and then Derrick White hitting that buzzer beater.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, the Celtics are feeling really good about themselves, so it'll be interesting about tonight. We know both of those teams play with extreme confidence. It's just going to be a fun Finals either way.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, it's definitely -- it's still a process because I still -- I'm able to play and contribute, which is the things that I said earlier I got to be grateful for. But I still feel like there's a lot of boxes I can still tick, growth I can still achieve, just in rehab in general and feeling better. But I've definitely made strides throughout the year. During the entire year I was kind of almost -- I was rehabbing simultaneously and like playing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I feel good at this point. There are some things that I'm doing different this time around to try to just keep my back in check and everything. But like someone said earlier, it could get taken away from anybody any day, so really just trying to stay in the moment and take it day by day and do my work every day and leave the rest up to God, for real.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think you definitely have to do that with this eight- or nine-day break, try to just find ways to make yourself go harder than a normal practice, just to make sure you're kind of in shape. Trying to create game shots in the flow of practice, normal pace, game pace. Then I've been doing different conditioning things just to try to stay in shape.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"It's a little different when you're not playing games every other day to try to stay in basketball shape, but we should be good. We've been practicing pretty hard, things like that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of Melo. He was one of my favorite players growing up, and we've actually developed a relationship off the court. When I was in New York for that little stretch we had against Brooklyn and the Knicks, we ran into each other and just chopped it up. He told me come kick it with him in the offseason, come out there and work out with him for a little while. So that's definitely something I might do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of his and his legacy. That's definitely one of the guys I looked up to growing up, for sure.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, he's handling it as well as any rookie could. He's already a valuable piece of this team and he's just a rookie. I told him, you can't trip about playing a lot some games and -- it doesn't matter how good you are as a rookie on a good team it's hard to get minutes.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"He already has a very good foundation as a player on this team, so going forward he's obviously a big part of this team. He knows that to be able to play as a rookie in the Playoffs, guard some of the best players in the world, is pretty dope. He just brings a winning culture. They won in Kansas.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I knew Christian growing up. He played with my little brother. So it's really good to have him on the team.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Seattle definitely had a big impact. I feel like growing up in Missouri and then moving out to Seattle and being around all those pros and getting coached by Brandon Roy, that was when I really took my game to the next level. He helped me just get better every day and eventually become the best player in the country on the best team in the country.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"That was his first year coaching, which is kind of crazy. I think he's won like four state championships since I left Seattle. He's just a good friend of mine to this day. He loves basketball. He's just a really good dude.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Seattle definitely has a big piece of my heart, and that was definitely a dope time in my life.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"They don't. No, I'm playing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think he's the longest -- correct me if I'm wrong, he's been here the longest out of all the staff. He's pretty much been here the longest.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"He's just the OG around here. He's just a goofy dude. He gives me encouragement before games, and we have our inside jokes. I'm pretty close with him out of all the staff and the whole organization. Me and Sparky are pretty close.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"He's definitely just a big part of our team culture, always bringing the upbeat attitude. Even though he's an equipment manager, he doesn't have to be that joyful every day, but he brings that good energy to the Ball Arena, and we just love that dude. He's definitely a big part of what we've got going on here, for sure.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Calvin is my guy, too. He's a real chill dude, real laid-back dude, but he does what needs to get done on that side. We have a good relationship.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Obviously I think it's pretty well known now the guys he brought in are a huge part of the reason why we're in the Finals. Obviously KCP and Bruce being two of those guys. But really the vets, too, as much as the guys on the floor are contributing to us winning, like DJ, Jeff, Ish, Reggie. Those guys' attitude and their leadership is just part of the reason why we're doing so well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,It's really just finding a group of guys that mesh in the locker room is a big part of winning. I think Calvin did a great job of that.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I just think I would say my family, really. Just their encouragement. Them being at the games, wherever that is, L.A., Phoenix. They've been flying to the games to watch me play. We've got a family group chat. That's always the first thing I check after games, see what they were saying during the game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think just having a family like that, seven brothers and sisters, I'm really lucky in that area. So I'd say my family, for sure.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Early in the season. I don't have an exact date, but I felt that Michael was fully back. I felt this was by far his best season as an NBA player. The commitment he made to being the best defensive player he could be and buying into that end was definitely evident early on, as well as was his commitment to being the best offensive player he could be and playing without the ball and moving without the ball and spacing the floor.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Obviously Jamal missed a lot more time than Michael, but I think for me with Michael, I could tell early in the season that he was poised to have a very good season. He was moving well, he was healthy and that was all we needed from him because he's such a talented player.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I mean, I think that makes for a great story, but I don't know if it's entirely accurate. I think throughout the year, not just the Playoffs, he's picked his spots in terms of when to be vocal, when to challenge his teammates.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Game 3 was just, hey, here's something we can do offensively, which is great. But I think it's even more important when we're playing at Houston and he calls the guys together before the game starts in warmup lines because he doesn't like how we're warming up.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, you know, all year long the one thing I've talked about with Christian is that he's a winner. The guy has won at every level, and here he is in the NBA Finals. It's kind of staying true to form for Christian Brown.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then as a rookie, game 2 at Golden State, he plays and he plays well because Jamal didn't play in that game. I think that's when we all realized that for a young player playing against the defending world champions on the road, he wasn't afraid. That really stuck out to me. Most young kids, they get in a situation or environment like that, they're going to be a little bit over their head, and he wasn't.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"All season long, Christian has been a pro in regard to staying ready. Am in the rotation? Am I not in the rotation? I'm not going to allow that to take away from my work ethic and my dedication to my craft.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then obviously the last two months of the year, whatever it was, he was a rotational player for the No. 1 team in the West. He's done his job in the Playoffs. He's gone out there and defended, rebounded, ran the floor, moved without it. He's never afraid of the moment, which you have to appreciate for such a young kid.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, it's definitely been a challenge because while these two other teams are going to a Game 7 and it's been great theater from afar because Miami is up 3-0 and now it's going back to Boston for a Game 7 -- yesterday we took off, but all the practices leading into it were about us, with a real heavy emphasis on conditioning, pace, purpose and just working on all the things that we need to.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then today we started working on things that both Miami and Boston, kind of things that we need to be prepared for, both offensively and defensively.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The best thing about tonight is we're going to finally know who we play, and that gives us Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday morning to get ready for Game 1.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, I think if I'm the same coach I was in year one, then I've failed. That wasn't meant for laughs. Thank you in the front row.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think for all of us, everybody sitting in this room, if you're the same person that you were from a year ago, not even just eight, then we've all failed.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I challenge myself to continue to grow, and not just as a coach but in all facets of life. If you're not growing and improving, then you're probably getting worse.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, there's no doubt in my mind that I am a much different coach than I was in year one. I think eight years in, I think for me, you kind of don't coach every dribble. You don't win and lose with every win or loss. It's not life and death.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You try to pick your spots when you need to be emotional. It can't be every game, it can't be every halftime, it can't be every postgame. But over the years I've challenged myself to look in the mirror, be honest with myself, listen to those around me and become the best version that I can be.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"And by the way, I think I've given him the ball for a long time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I have to give so much credit to Stan and Josh Kroenke. When we beat L.A. the other night in L.A., I loved the fact that they were there and part of that celebration. I often allude to my third season, that game 82 at Minnesota when we lost. We won 46 games, but we lost an overtime game to go to the Playoffs.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Probably 80, 90 percent of pro sports teams probably would have said, we have to pivot here, we have to go in a different direction. I can remember after that game being really dejected and down because we failed in that quest. But John Kroenke came over to me and put his arm around me and was so excited. He talked about look at how well our young players Nikola and Jamal just played in the play-in tournament before the play-in tournament.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the fact that they had the ability to be patient and take a step back and have a big-picture approach, we had the chance to do something special if we let this continue to grow and develop and mature. So, yes, I think trusting the process, I think being patient, and that's what all the great sports teams over the last 50 years, regardless of the sport -- you look at teams like the Steelers, they've had three coaches in seems like 70 years.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The programs that change a coach every year or two never get off the ground. You have to let something take root, let it grow, go with the growing pains and hopefully it blossoms into something like we've seen here in Denver.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the way we've done it, I hear from a lot of people saying, we want to be like the Denver Nuggets. We want to draft well. We want to have our players develop, add the right pieces around them, be patient and see where it goes.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"This has been really fun to be a part of that process. I can't thank the ownership, front office enough for being as patient as they have been.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Nobody wants to hear my coaching takeaways. That was a crazy ending. Obviously that game was won and lost quite a few times in the last three minutes. At one point Boston looks like they're going to win going away by double figures. Then Jimmy Butler gets to the foul line. Al Horford fouls a three-point shooter. Great challenge by Joe Mazzulla because even though they don't win the challenge, they put the time back on the clock, which allows Derrick White to have the time to get that put-back in before the final buzzer. That's why you always preach to your players, you've got to play for 48 minutes. That game right there is a perfect example of that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know I speak for everybody in that locker room, we just can't wait for tonight's game to be over, to finally have some clarity, so when we wake up tomorrow morning we know who we're playing, we know who we're preparing for and we can kind of turn the page and really focus in on that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,The Eastern Conference Finals has been a hell of a series. I think this is the first time where a team has been down 3-0 to force a Game 7 and have home-court advantage. So we'll see if that plays a part. But I'm expecting another crazy game and ending in is Boston tonight.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"All that. For us obviously knowing we're going to be playing one of these teams and all week long with my coaching staff, we've been talking about both teams, the problems they present and the things that we have to be worried about. We always identify the themes going into each and every series, and they change depending upon who you're playing and what problems they present.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"We had a long meeting this morning, and tomorrow we'll have more clarity in that regard. But I watch it as a fan of the game. I watch it as a coach getting prepared to play Game 1 against one of those two teams.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,But I allow my wife to come down once in a while to check on me. She's allowed down.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"What stands out for me is that because he's healthy, he's confident. When you're not healthy and you can't move and do the things that you're accustomed to doing, that really makes it hard to go out there and be confident in your game and what you're able to do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"First and foremost with Michael being physically healthy, I think that is giving him the mental confidence to go out there and play the game at a high level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the series he had against the Lakers, just the scoring, the rebounding, the efficiency was a huge part of us sweeping L.A. in that Western Conference Finals.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,But he's in a very good place right now. He's confident. He's really bought into trying to become the best player he can be on both ends of the floor.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,One example of that is end of games. He does not want to be taken out because of the perceived lack of a defensive player.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Every time this season when he has been taken out, he gives Ryan Saunders a death glare -- like, I can't believe you're taking me out. He's closed a lot of games for us lately because he's 6-10, he's defending well and he's rebounding at a high level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's confident, he's aggressive and he's had a huge impact on this team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it's interesting, when I go back to that trade deadline, I think we were in Tampa playing the Raptors. As is always the case, to get a player, an impact player, you have to give something up. Gary Harris was a huge part of our team. Gary Harris was here when I got here and was a big part of us kind of building our team into what it is today.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"To give up a guy like Gary Harris, as well as R.J. Hampton, who was a rookie, that was hard. The lead-up, we're driving to the airport. We spent the night after the game. We're driving to the airport. It's the day of the trade deadline, and Gary is on the bus with us. I get a call, and as we're approaching the plane, the trade is done.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"In a weird way, maybe it was great it happened this way because a lot of guys were crying, and we all had a chance to give Gary a hug and let him know how much we loved him and appreciated him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that was hard. That's something that is never really talked about when trades are made. You always talk about the player you're getting. Just like trading a guy like Monte and Will for KCP, man, those guys were here for a long time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Second part of your question, it was evident pretty quickly, to your point, but the game that stands out right after that trade deadline was our game in L.A. beating the Clippers. They were healthy, we were healthy and we beat them, and Aaron's impact was noticeable because of his ability to guard a guy like Kawhi Leonard.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know after that game, I felt we had a real chance to win a championship that year.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then unfortunately as we all know, soon thereafter, Jamal suffered the ACL injury, which kind of put things out of whack for a while. So Aaron has been tremendous for us. You look at the job he's done against Karl-Anthony Towns, against guys like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and whoever we have next round he'll play just as important a role for us, so very grateful that Aaron is here.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's been difficult for us as far as how long we have to wait to play, just being anxious and being ready. That's the most difficult part. We're just trying to stay focused with it for this long time period that we have.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Lucky for us, we get a couple more days of rest. But we're enjoying this time, fixing all our injuries, getting back, getting ready to 100 percent, everybody, and just trying to stay focused. Everybody just reminding each other what's at stake.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I'm going to tell them what I see fit. I don't know. I haven't been -- my time I had in the 2020 NBA Finals wasn't this. I didn't have a long period of time to rest.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But just talking, having conversation, just reminding everybody on the goal that we have. Just trying to just tell them to keep -- reminding them to stay locked in, no matter how you do it, just try to do it the best that you can.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But I think as a team, I think we've done a great job of that as far as coming in, getting our work in, off days, just staying on treatment and just being ready.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It says a lot, just being professional, making it work for himself and the team. It's just being a professional and just adjusting to your teammates and the organization.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I feel like we've been here a long period of time working out. I feel like it does affect us just because I've felt it out there before playing. But like I said, the advantage is them having to come in and adjust to the altitude, which we've been here for a while now doing that, working out, getting our breathing right, lungs, everything. It's going to be an advantage for us, I would say.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"No. I mean, Mike is a great coach. Been doing it for a while. I had his dad in Detroit as an assistant coach, so I've been knowing both of them for a long time. He's just very professional about his job. He wants to get it done no matter what.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It was. For me, it was a breath of fresh air. I got a chance to compete for a championship again. Just knowing this team from playing them, I knew what we had and what I was coming into. I fit well, I would say.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,It made it so easy for me when I did get traded. It made it so easy for me to adjust and just be comfortable within myself and my game.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I don't remember the conversation between us, but every time I see him, though, I do thank him. We do talk and just -- I'm happy I'm here and being in the position to win another championship.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"They've both got a lot of fight in them. They're not going to back down and give up games easy. That's pretty much all I can see right now as far as like watching the game. Both teams are tough. But when we do our thing, we cover both teams because we don't know who it's going to be. We're just hoping -- we're just waiting right now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It is. We make it fun. I feel like on any team you can make it fun when everybody is sharing the ball. But here, everybody shares the ball. Everybody wants to help each other out, no matter what it is. That just makes your confidence go high when you've got your teammates behind you all the way.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"First of all, we have more veterans over here. Secondly, they're all vocal. Everybody talks, no matter who it is. Even me, they come up and talk to me, give me advice on what I should do or ask me what I think about this. I love feeding off them guys like Ish, DJ, Jeff. We talk a lot about just basketball. They've just helped me out to be the leader that I am, vocal, and just being able to get my teammates in position and just letting them know, all right, we can do this.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, I don't think there's a difference. My 2020 championship, I had great Laker fans. Here I have even greater fans. I just love being able to put on for my fans. It gives a great feeling and a confidence just knowing the screaming and the support behind you is also greater.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I heard the rumor. I didn't know how true it was until the next morning when I woke up and got on the phone with my agent. They said it could be possible but wasn't sure yet. But my agent did his job. He made it happen. I'm happy.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm always talking about it. For me, just to be a part of history with the Denver Nuggets, making their first Finals appearance, winning their first NBA championship, I feel like I'm more excited about that than anything.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"No, to be honest, when we win, the win was nice, and like about half an hour after that, we were just, okay, it's a win. It was not -- to be honest it, was not some -- I thought it was going to be much bigger feeling to be honest.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,And I didn't celebrate or whatever. I was just enjoying relaxing.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He give me the ball a little bit more basketball-wise. But like this, not much. I think he still have passion. He's still into it. Still -- you know, basketball-wise, he's giving me the ball more but like a person, I think he didn't change a lot.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I think he deserve especially because he averaged a lot. He averaged 30 points, a great percentage in the last series. I think that's really hard to do, especially that high number of points.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But not just points. I think his energy, I would say even from the first round, his energy, he's been our best player since round one, and he's really stepping up and in that reaction, like being in. Even if he doesn't make shots, this, that, but his energy is always good. I think that's the best feeling for the guys around him. You know, yes, we know he can make shots, he can go for 50. But even when things doesn't go his way, he doesn't fall down. He is still playing. He's still fighting. I think that's the best thing about him right now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, to be honest, you cannot control what people are going to talk about you are not going to talk about you, so I'm not even going to comment of, you know, he deserve or not.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think he deserve it, but who am I.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"My first couple of years, I had really good chemistry with Gary Harris, if you guys remember. We had a really nice two-man game that we have. Then kind of slow build-up to Jamal.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But he always had a fight in his eye. He always had that something that -- he was, I don't want to say chasing something, where he always has to be better, be more. He always wanted to be something bigger than he was in that moment. I think if I remember him -- if I have one thing that I remember him in my rookie year, it was that. He was always hungry for more.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, he was there. He won a championship. But the best thing about KCP, he knows exactly where to be, and I think that's the best. He's doing that in first game, seventh game, playoff game, Finals game, whatever, pregame. He always do what he supposed to do, and I think that's the best way to describe him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not seven. It's basically my whole life, except wife, who is 10 years with me. But always my family, my mom and dad was always supporting, my dad especially. He always thought that I could be something more -- like Jamal wanted to be something more.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Then when I go to the other city, and kind of my older brother took that role and kind of he lived with me, and then we came to the United States, and then my brother, Nemanja, who lives here before, seven years I think or nine years, it's like 15 years, we get together, and it's just a nice journey.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, when I was coming to United States, I was happy that I'm going to be with them. When you're a kid and you're small, when you were little, you always want to be around with the big brothers, and that was -- I was not going to say I was more happy. I was more happy to be around them than being in NBA.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"No. That cannot help you. But the thing that I knew that even before that the basketball is not main thing in my life, and probably never going to be.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"And to be honest, I look at it because I have something more at home that is more important than basketball. I think that's maybe that I'm going to -- I learned this. I knew that but this kind of proved me that I'm correct.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, yes. Especially when you get bad days, good days. When you go home, it's always normal, and I think that's the best thing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"At that time, I didn't know. At that time, I never thought I'm going to be in NBA. But seemed like it was all connected and we all get together in USA, so it was a good thing for us. Maybe that was a sign that it's a good thing because my wife, at that time girlfriend, she was going in Oklahoma in college, and we were separate for six, seven, eight months, I don't remember.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But we were young and it was kind of nice period, nice to get together in that age, 20, 21. But I never thought I'm going to be in NBA. Maybe that was a good sign that my family -- that my family -- I didn't know that there was going to be my wife -- my girlfriend, I didn't know that's going to be my wife, get together and live from day one.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. That's a good question. You know, I thought we going to do some -- I thought I'm going to have in myself, I'm going to have a bigger -- I'm going to have bigger emotions, yes, we won the game and I was really happy, yes, yes, we made history, this, that. But at the end of the day, next year, nobody is going to remember us or two years from now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"So maybe if we win it all, maybe it's going to be different but we will see.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, still isn't, but yeah, that's true. Felipe was the first guy who told me I was going to be an MVP. It was a car drive to the airport, I remember him, I was laughing. He is the guy who first mention to me in conversation or whatever.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But I never thought that I'm going to come here, but to be honest I'm playing the same way since my days in Sombor, I think, so I didn't change. Maybe I upgrade a little bit, but I didn't trade my style or play since day one, and it's working. So maybe the consistency is the key.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't watch Game 5, so I don't know. I was walking with my daughter -- I'm lying. I watched the first quarter.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Today, I don't know what we're going to do but I think we're going to -- family, I think, maybe somebody is going to watch together, but I'm going to watch with family, or not.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Maybe I'm not. Maybe that's just talk around me. I don't know, I think probably my family, my close friends, my family, you need to ask them. I think I didn't change because I still have the same friends, same family, same spot that I'm going, same things that I'm doing. But maybe you need to ask my friends and my family. But they are not going to answer you.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, there is no answer, probably.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, just keeping things tight. You know, everybody coming out, getting their work in, staying in their routine because you know we have so much time off.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like you said, we don't know who to prepare for, but we are going to be ready for both, and just staying tight, getting shots up and making sure you're healthy, making sure you're in the gym, not staying out of the gym. So just keeping everything tight.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, obviously this is what every player wants to do is compete at the highest level, and you know, winning is obviously more fun for everybody.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So just going from the situation in Kansas and winning a lot, and then winning my last year and then coming straight here and getting into the situation that, one, is a good fit, and two, then we get to win right away. I couldn't imagine a better spot to be.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"And just the people around you, obviously I enjoy them and just this team, and so yeah, I'm blessed to have two years in a row playing at the highest level and winning at the highest level, and it's different. In the NCAA Tournament, it's one game. So, there's a lot of pressure on that one game, and here there's a lot of ups and downs.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, we have had series where we win two and we think we are up 2-0, it's a big lead, and then you go lose two on the road. It's completely different. But the same pressure, the same fun atmosphere, fun environment and the fans at both levels have been great. So, just blessed to have that opportunity to win at the highest level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, they don't ask too much of me. Obviously, I mean, they get that from what we did in college as a team. And then just having that on your resume coming into this, they know that I wasn't coming in here trying to, you know, do too much or play outside of my role or play outside of myself.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They allowed me to be me, and I said that all year. Like Coach has allowed me to do what I do. My teammates, all the players have allowed me to be me, and it's just made the transition so much easier. I don't have to come in and try to do anything I'm not good at, and just thrive in the role that they put me in.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think earlier they saw that when I was put in that position, I didn't try to do too much, and I just wanted to win. I wanted to make winning plays, and those energy effort plays. And I think that this team is a team when I got here that was like super talented, like the most talented team in the NBA probably, and we just needed pieces. We didn't need anybody to come in off the bench and try to do too much, try to shoot too much.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"We just needed pieces that complement what we already have, and I think they saw that I was willing to do that, willing to play defense, and then obviously they taught me a lot over the course of the year. So I think that's probably how I earned their trust.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"No, I don't think so at all. I think that I did similar things in college. Obviously, I scored more in the role, but it was similar my freshman year. I didn't have that same scoring role.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So you build those things up over time and this is really similar to -- I was on a good team my freshman year and I was more a piece to a really good team, and just making energy and effort plays in the time that I get, whether it's two minutes, five minutes, twenty minutes, just try to make an impact and make an impact on the team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"The biggest thing I learned. I think the biggest takeaway from the Conference Finals itself, for me, like I just said was like whether you get two minutes or you get 20 minutes, you have to make an impact in those minutes, and there was times definitely I could have been better.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, looking back on that, I have to be able to build on that and learn from different mistakes. You know you're going to make mistakes but the leash gets shorter in the playoffs. We are winning. We swept in the Conference Finals. So, there's nothing to be upset about or anything like that. You've just got to learn from it. You have two minutes, and then you have to make an impact in those two minutes and the team has to be better when you're on the court. So that's probably what I learned the most.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Man, there's a lot. I think that everybody kind of talks about his routine. You know, he comes in and does the same exact routine every single day, the same shots, the same step-backs, the same fadeaways, the same free throw routine. He doesn't take any shortcuts. He's here early. He's here getting treatment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, his routine, his consistency with what he does is obviously the most impressive part, and I think that's why you see -- and he makes comments like that all the time. Like it's just no different than what he does every day. Like those shots that he hits, all the fadeaways, all the one-legged-behind-his-head shots that he's hitting, like he shoots these things every day. So, he's not surprised when they go in, and I think that consistency is what everybody wants to take away from him.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Well, I don't know about that exact shot, but I mean he hit one at home that was the exact same shot. Just I think it was on the other side.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think he was shooting like a really good percentage on those fadeaways, like the last-second shot we beat Orlando early in the year on a step-back, similar shot. So, when the clock is going down, that's what he's good at, and he shoots the same exact shot every single time, and it goes in.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,So just the consistency in what he does every day. Nobody is surprised when he hits them.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I mean, obviously he knows the game better than anybody I've ever been around obviously and I think that everybody would say the same.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, him and Coach see eye-to-eye on a lot of things and they are on the same page, and that's probably built up over however many years they have been together.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So him, Jamal and Coach are on the same page. A lot of plays they draw up, I know Coach said in one of his postgame interviews that Nikola came over and took the board and we ran like the same five plays that him and Jamal drew up every time and scored on it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So just the knowledge that he brings, and he's not a guy that wants to take over in the huddle. He listens to Coach and does what Coach wants him to, and when he sees things, he points them out and that goes for anybody on the team. I think Jamal sees things, he points them out, and everybody is on the same page. And that's just trust built up over, you know, however many years they have been together.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I've got good teammates. I've had really good coaches. Obviously, I went to Kansas, Coach Self was great. Come here and another great coach with Coach Malone.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like I said, every system I've went into, whether it was AAU or it was up to the NBA, every system I've went into was a winning culture and was a team that demanded certain things of you.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, I'm not going to sit here and say it was me coming in and changing anything. It was me coming in and adapting to what was already set up before I got there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, KU had a culture set up when I got there, and I was just really easily able to adapt to that, and I think I would say the same thing for here.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like when I got drafted, I knew, hey, this team is the most talented team in the NBA, especially that starting five, and obviously we had Bruce who has been important as anybody.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's no secret thing but just joining a culture and being able to adapt is how you get on the court doing that, and I think that's what I've been good at is adapting.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think the trust that they have built up, like I said before I got here, and then adding pieces like Bruce and like me and guys that come in that are low maintenance. They listen to Coach and they trust what he's telling us. We come in and we drill the same fundamental things in practice all the time. Teams that struggle, they get old with those things, and Coach says all the time, I think he said the other day, ""Don't get bored with success.""",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think we have came in and we have drilled the fundamentals and listened to Coach and nobody tries to push back on what he says. It's a good balance between Coach listening to the players, like we said with Nikola, and us listening to Coach.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think everyone is on the same page, and we have a lot of guys in that exact moment in their career, they want to win and this is their time to win, and I think that we had all the right pieces come together. And we are here. We have not done anything yet. Job is not even close to finished. We want to watch who wins this game and then finish the job.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"He's been great, ever since Draft night. Like when he drafted me and he told me exactly what he needed from me and what he wanted to see from me.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, he doesn't chime in too much. Kind of lets me be me. That's another part of this whole organization, letting me be who I am, and I think ever since Draft night, he's told me what I wanted. He knew that I fit well with this team. Thought I was a perfect fit.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, we've been on the same page with that, and like you said, I'm his first draft pick. So it's my job to do what I'm supposed to do and come in and contribute. I think I've done that for the most part. Like I said we are four games away from doing what we want to do. I don't think anybody in the locker room feels like we've accomplished what we want to accomplish yet.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So Mr. Booth has been a big part of my first year, and he just chimes in when he sees different things, but it's my job to make him look good, obviously.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They are similar for sure. Kind of like old school way teach things, the way they go about things. I like that. I think that's the coaching style I prefer. They will both tell you when you're wrong, but they will also tell you when you're doing things right.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So they are tough on you. They are funny. They like to joke around. They keep things light-hearted, but they really want to win. Those are two of the most competitive people I've been around since I started playing basketball.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Coach Self, that's all he's about and all he's done, and Coach Malone is the same way. You guys see Coach Malone get so frustrated because he wants to win so bad and that goes for everybody on the team. Everybody on the team is at the point of their career where we want to win. Like I always want to win.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"But just coming off that championship, and having a chance to get another one, we are all in the same place and I think there's similarities with everybody's mindset. So Coach Self and him are similar but I think everybody is similar and like our competitiveness with this team.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think there's a lot of differences. Like I said just with how the games are set up, and college is one-game elimination and this is obviously a series.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So there's a lot of differences. This you, you have to be more keyed in on personnel and with players' tendencies. In college, you're more set on sets and things like that. There's a lot of differences, but I think just being ready to win and we have guys that do what it takes to put ourselves in that position, and we've got talented guys.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's definitely some similarities and differences, but it's all the same thing. Every time you go out there, we are just trying to win.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"No, I think I'm pretty much right where I'm supposed to be. I got drafted to a perfect fit and this is where we all expected to be. I think I said this multiple times.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I told all my people this, when we won the Western Conference Finals, it felt good, but I mean, it didn't feel like -- we still haven't done what we wanted to do. Like I don't feel like I've accomplished the goal, and I want these next four games worse than anything.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"This is kind of where I expected to be it the team I'm on and everybody in the locker room is on the same page with what they want and winning. So I think I'm right where I need to be, especially for this year, and obviously there's a lot of growth, and like I just said, I learned a lot from, especially last series.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,27-May,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"But there's a lot of growth that I need to make, and right now, we are focused on winning and then in the offseason we'll focus on other individual things. But I think I'm right where I need to be and just want to get these four games really bad.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was good. Everybody on the flight was standing up, it wasn't just the players, so it was nice to have the staff, just mingling, all that, which was cool. Obviously, everybody was just enjoying the moment, like you said. It was a good flight.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just our awareness, especially we need to lock in on practices for just the detail stuff, man. Let's be on time, let's not have any turnovers that we're doing scripts, just kind the simple things so we're not getting sloppy just because we are where we are. I think it's more of those mental awareness days instead of -- we know our bodies are going to be right by that time, June 1, so just making sure our mental is staying sharp and locked in throughout these days.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think he's done amazing, not just with his scoring or his shooting but with the all-around game. He's grabbing boards, he's helping out on the boards, grabbing like 10 a game, and playing defense, just communicating more, doing all the little things that will help us be more in tune on both ends of the court, staying spaced, not cutting when it's not there. Picking his spots when to shoot it, pass it, cut. Just everything. Just playing a more complete game throughout the game.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"That's the thing, we take the rest, yeah, but you don't want to pick up bad habits throughout this week. Like I said to Mike, just staying sharp, whatever it is. If we've got to flip the switch and lock in for a drill or two, let me do that. Just be able to stay locked in.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,We don't want to get relaxed. I think that's the biggest thing. We don't want to relax and just wait. We want to stay sharp.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Well, on the defensive end I'd say it's our intent. I was watching the hockey game yesterday, just threw it on, and they said one team is playing -- I think it was the green team and the white team. Couldn't tell you. But one team was -- they said one team was playing with a certain intent, a certain intensity, a meaning, whether they turn it over or not, whether they missed a shot or not, they play with a certain aggression and awareness and the other team was just kind of going through the motions, and you could visibly see it.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think our defense has been being played with intent. I think we've all been on a string. When we need a stop, we all lock in, even if we don't get it, we lock in and try and get it possession by possession. I think that's crucial at this stage.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"They've been great. I think the biggest thing for them is just staying ready. I think during the season, P-Wat Peyton Watson came in against Phoenix and another team I think he played where he played really well. Just being aggressive, not overthinking. CB Christian Braun has been great all year, just picking his spots and being solid while he's on the court. And everybody else, man, just staying ready and staying within the group upstairs.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"If we do two groups, everybody is either making a sub, subbing themselves in, or just knowing what's going on. I think that's crucial.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"So right now we're very team oriented. We've got everybody participating, everybody involved, and everybody mentally, like I said, locked in.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think we've seen everything. I was going to make a joke, but no, that's okay, because it'll be everywhere.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just think we've seen everything. We've seen all the adjustments. We've seen the double from the baseline, the double from the top, the sign from a non-shooter to single coverage to -- know what I'm saying? We've seen every different type of mixture. We've seen them try to put Kawhi and PG to switch it, we've seen everything.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,It's all a read. It's all balance. It's all timing. I don't think that worked.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just think because we've envisioned it since the beginning, like just me personally, me and him have envisioned it and dreamt about it and went through all these moments in our head and on the court.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's been saying, how often do you get this opportunity to be in this position and living your dream basically, living it up.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,Just taking advantage of the opportunity and realizing what the opportunity is I think is the biggest thing. So just having fun right now.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I don't know. I've been playing basketball a lot lately.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, that's why it's nice playing with this team because everything is a read. If somebody is open, you're going to see that on film that that guy is open, and everybody is playing for each other. If I cut, it's for the other guy to get an open shot. If I run my lane, it's for everybody else to get their own shot.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, I think when we're just playing the right way, everything opens up for everybody. Could be a Bruce three, could be a Mike back-door cut, could be AG that's just standing in the dunker waiting. I think everybody eats when we're all playing for each other, and we've been doing that for a while now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,I think we're just in a great rhythm of playing unselfish basketball.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, like I said, we came off the bench together my rookie year when I was backing up Gary Harris, and he was backing up Nurk Jusuf Nurkic. So, we would actually come into the game together, and we would run post-ups or just simple give-and-goes, but we used to run it crazy, run it really good, and he used to make a lot of over-the-head passes, and I'd say then we kind of developed a chemistry.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Soon we both started, we started playing off each other. We started to figure out where we like the ball, when we liked the ball, when I'm going to pass, when he's going to pass, when he's driving, when to relocate, where to relocate. It was just all the details we picked up together over time playing for most of our careers.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, not just me but everybody. I just think he puts everybody in the right spots. When it's time to lock in, he can lock you in. He doesn't -- he's funny. He goofs around a lot, yeah, but when we're messing up -- you know like you know when you're messing up but you're getting away with it? Yeah, he'll get on you, and I think I respect that a lot just because we're all in it together. It's not like it's malicious or anything, it's just we all have a goal here. We're all here for a reason.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's nice. We've been putting -- I go to him for a lot of the offensive stuff, just reads and what he's seeing just because I know he's locked in on that, and sometimes Coach may be thinking about subs or lineups or time and score, whatever, but he's always given me great input on what we can run or sometimes we have the same ideas, which is just really nice to see that what I am feeling in the game he's also seeing from afar.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"Well deserved, and he should definitely be getting more offers.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"I mean, you can only play one game at a time, but we know we've got four to go, four wins to go.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"To answer your first question, no, we haven't sat down and talked about it or anything like that. Like I said, we talk the language on the court when we're playing. We just read the game and play off each other. There's no -- it's hard to explain. There's no selfishness when we're playing the game. It's just hit, cut, pass, move. If it's not there, you don't throw it. I try to go one-on-one, doesn't have it, hit, cut. We're just kind of free flowing, playing the game, and it has been working.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's nice. Especially coming off the injuries, to be here. It just feels good. Like I said, I want to win these four before we indulge in any celebrations or anything like that. Just trying to stay locked in. Yeah, just stay locked in and enjoy the moment, but we know we've got more work to do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, we're just trying to win a championship. All that comes after you win the championship. If we were to lose, no one gets that trophy, right? We win the championship, everybody eats. I'm just excited to see everybody succeed.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I didn't see anything. I didn't hear anything.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, I remember everything. I was sitting there with my coaches. It felt like it took forever to take off, and the front of the plane had some music playing, sounded pretty lively. But the back of the plane was -- I was nervous to go back there. They said, Coach, you don't want to go in the back, so I stayed away from the back and kept my head down. Watched part of the fourth quarter, all the plays that we made down the stretch, which was just incredible.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,Have we come up with a name for Nikola's shot? Is there going to be like a historical name for the shot he made? A Sombor Sling. All right.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"It was eventful. But for me, it was just trying to soak in the whole moment, and kept on asking myself, Is the series really over? Let everybody else have some fun, but we've got a lot of work to do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it's impossible to keep your rhythm if you're not playing games. You can do whatever you want in practice, but there's no way you can replicate playing an NBA playoff game. We gave our guys off Tuesday. Wednesday was an option day. A lot of guys showed up.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then just yesterday had everybody come in, get some conditioning in, PD, and today we got a good practice. Didn't go long. But for us, my biggest concern is the rhythm, as you mentioned, but more importantly conditioning. You're playing every other day, every other day for so long, and now all of a sudden you have an eight-, nine-, 10-day break, whatever it is. I wanted to make sure we got up and down, conditioned.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"The energy in the gym was great. It's a tough situation because you're just kind of preparing for an opponent you don't know who you're going to play. So right now as I told our players, this is about us. We have to shore up who we are and address the areas that we have not been maybe good enough or areas that we can clean up.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's really hard to keep your rhythm when you're not playing NBA games, but we'll do everything we can to try to keep the rhythm as best as possible.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think for eight years now, I think it's kind of been a part of our culture. In this business, you have to bring in talented players that's a given. But I think we've always done a good job of identifying guys that will fit into this culture.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, it's a delicate balance because I think in life, not just in sports but in life, you have to enjoy moments. I think if you don't enjoy the small victories and the moments along the way, I think you're missing something.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"At the same time, we have much work in front of us. Our goal wasn't just to win the Western Conference championship. It wasn't just to get to the NBA Finals. Our goal was to win a championship, and obviously that's in front of us still.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"So you enjoy the moment and you enjoy the people you're working with and go to war with every night, but at the same time, I think it's my job to remind our guys that don't read and listen to everybody telling you how great you are because then you're going to get a little soft with success, and I don't want us getting soft with success. I want us staying hungry. I want us staying desperate and urgent and disciplined.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's our biggest challenge right now, because we don't even know who we're playing. That's going to be our biggest challenge as we approach next Thursday night.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, obviously that last four seconds was an eternity. I took that technical foul in that second quarter on purpose because it was -- which is most of the time when I get a tech, it's on purpose.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"As I told one of the officials at the end of the first half, I said -- I let him know I did that on purpose, and this is why. I just felt it was getting out of hand.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then you allude to the last play of the game where they get LeBron the ball in the high post. He drives to his left hand, Aaron Gordon on his hip and Jamal Murray in front of him. Puts his hands in there, makes a great defensive play, correct no-call. But we always know in those situations, a great player a lot of times will get those calls.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Kudos to the referees for realizing it was what it was. I think all of us were somewhat stunned when the buzzer went off, there was no whistle, holy s---, we won. I think I speak for a lot of people. So that was amazing.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Nikola's shot, I mean, that's what I wanted to watch because just all the key plays down the stretch, things that -- Nikola's drive, which wound up being the winning basket of the game, just guys stepping up with a potential sweep on the line.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You and I talked about this, Kis. You reminded me of the history this franchise has had with the Lakers, and it hasn't been a history that Nuggets fans are proud of. So to do it against that team in that building made it even that much more special because of the guys like Dan Issel, Doug Moe, just the great players, great people that have represented this franchise for so many years. So this was for them, as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, we're just going to show up for Game 1.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, each round we have one coach dedicated to the opponent. So right now obviously we have two coaches, one working on Boston, one working on Miami. We have been talking about both teams every day. Obviously watched the game last night, and we'll watch again tomorrow night to see if Miami can close it out.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you talk about Miami first and you look at what they've done this postseason, being in the Play-In, upsetting Milwaukee 4-1 in the first round, beating New York in the second round and jumping out to a 3-0 lead over Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals. Erik Spoelstra is a hell of a coach. Won a championship. He's been there forever. Jimmy Butler has been played at an extremely high level.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But when I look at Miami, I kind of see a lot of similarities between Miami and us. People talk about Jimmy, and Bam was an All-Star, but to me they have guys stepping up every night.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Gabe Vincent has been phenomenal. Him being out last night was a big advantage for Boston because Gabe Vincent has been playing so well. Caleb Martin has been playing so well. Kyle Lowry has had a great postseason. Kevin Love, Duncan Robinson. Tyler Herro may come back.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that that game is going to be -- if it's Miami, that series will be hard-fought, very good defensive team and with a guy in Jimmy Butler that has shown that, kind of like Nikola and Jamal, the biggest stage, he takes advantage of the opportunity.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then obviously in Boston you have a team that was in the NBA Finals last year. We know what they're capable of on both ends of the floor. Jayson Tatum is one of the best one-on-one players in the game. Jaylen Brown, that two-headed attack that they have. But their other guys, their role players, if you will, the Al Horfords, the Marcus Smarts, the Derrick Whites, the Malcolm Brogdons, those guys, Robert Williams.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You don't get to the Finals with just one player. I think ourselves and, whether it's Boston or Miami, have complete teams and have quality depth.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"No matter who it is, we know that we'll have our hands full trying to bring home the first championship in franchise history.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"That he's never changed. I think we all see it in all walks of life. How does fame, fortune affect you, and for most people, it goes to their head and they become something different. Sometimes they forget where they've come from and who helped them get to where they've gotten to. And the one thing I really love about Nikola, just forget basketball, to your point, just as a young man who is a proud father and a husband, as you mentioned, but through all the success, the MVPs, the max contracts, all that stuff, he's still the same guy. I marvel at that because I've been in the league and around this game a long time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"That is a rarity in this business. And for a celebrity, a superstar in general. The fact that Nikola is still a humble, selfless person and he cares about home, he cares about family, he cares about his horses -- like the guy is just who he is. I couldn't have more respect for him as a man because of that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,Interesting question. You have to find ways to improve from series to series and round to round to try to advance. But every round and every opponent is a completely different problem and challenge.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,Every team is built differently.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You think about the first round with guys like Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards, you think about the second round with two unstoppable players in Devin Booker and Kevin Durant and you think about LeBron and AD. I think overall our defense has really passed that test to this point.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then you think about our offense, we played the Lakers, who had the No. 1 defense in the Playoffs, and our offensive rating after four games was 122.3, which is historical. So that speaks to how potent the offense is. When you combine a capable defense with that offense, that allows you to do great things. That's what we've been able to do.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I see just kind of a real consistency from our group, from Game 1 against Minnesota through Game 4 against the Lakers. That's what you want at this time of year.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, if anybody is still talking about the Lakers in the NBA Finals, that's on them. They've gone fishing. We're still playing. The narrative should be on whatever two teams are still alive, because to get to that point is historical in nature for us.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's the first time in franchise history the Denver Nuggets have made the NBA Finals. We're not satisfied with that, but I just hope that the narrative is on the two teams that are representing their conferences. Let's salute and appreciate the greatness of every one of those players on the court. Let's appreciate the journey each of them has made to get to this point.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"We have guys, it'll be their first time in the Finals. We have guys in KCP that have won a championship before. That should be the narrative. Let's get all the negativity out of the way, because this is a tremendous accomplishment. I hope that they're celebrated for that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Oh, it'll be a hell of a challenge. To your point, if you look at Jimmy Butler's body of work and what he's been doing since that first round against Milwaukee, upsetting the No. 1 seed four games to one. Milwaukee has got some really good defensive players. I think I heard Jrue Holiday say the other day it didn't matter who was guarding Jimmy in that series, he was in a zone and he was unstoppable.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You don't stop a guy like Jimmy Butler with one player. It's not going to be just on Aaron Gordon. It won't be just on Michael Porter or whoever is guarding him. You have to guard guys like that, and you mentioned them, the KDs, the Anthony Edwardses, the Devin Bookers, the LeBron Jameses. That is five guys defending as one to try to stop a player with that kind of talent. That's going to be the same mindset if it is Miami trying to stop Jimmy Butler. You have to give him different looks and you have to keep him off balance and you have to have five guys locked into that task one possession at a time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, no, I can't go home and be in like Game 7 mindset because my wife and kids would leave me. I have to force myself to take a deep breath and remind myself that I am a husband, I am a father and to be a part of my family. My family keeps me balanced. My family keeps me grounded. I think that's so important at this time of the season.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"We spend a tremendous amount of time preparing our players, preparing ourselves and getting ready for each and every game. But I think you also have to take time to enjoy the moment and be a regular person. If that means me going home today and beating my wife in pickleball, so be it. But I have to make sure that I'm taking a deep breath once in a while and enjoying the view while also maintaining an eye and a perspective on what we have in front of us. That's our attitude as a team right now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know what, I've never heard that question before, and I think it's a great one because I've never even thought about that. It's funny how different players use maybe a perceived slight -- I was drafted, I was traded -- they use it as motivation to carry them forward.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the eight years I've been with Nikola, and I spend a lot of time with him not just during the season but in the offseason, off the court, I've never felt him have any kind of perceived slight about being drafted 41.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think for him it's been more about somebody took a chance on me, even though I guess he was drafted during a Taco Bell commercial. Maybe that was what pushed him forward, was it didn't even have his pick on the draft.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"Early on, being the best player he could be was not necessarily about a skill set. It was about maturing, growing up, handling adversity, dealing with the referees, getting into the best shape of his life, losing weight. I think once that all happened, that kind of coincided with our rise to where we've been the last five seasons now.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I can't speak for Nikola, but I've never felt that being picked 41st in the second round has been his motivating factor for him to be a two-time MVP and to be a guy that is averaging a triple-double in the Playoffs. I think what really motivates him is no more individual accolades and awards he wants to be a world champion. I think that's what motivates Nikola Jokic as well as everybody else in this building.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, I mean, everybody was super happy. Everybody was just having a good time. I was all throughout the plane, talking to everyone through the front and the back. Then I got a little tired, so I went to sleep.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,But high spirits on the plane. We're happy we're in the Finals.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Pretty relaxed days, recovering and getting ready for the Finals. Today was kind of our first practice. Last few days were PD days, so today was our first practice.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I mean, honestly, either. I don't care. We're going to prepare the same, whoever wins. But that's a great series right now. I can't wait to find out who we play.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"For me, it's not difficult at all. I've watched every game. Right now, really just recovering, resting. And then our days off have me some time to go out and golf. It's been great.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, the first day of golf I played pretty well. The second day was terrible.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, this is just a great locker room. Make everything easy, make coming to work easy. Like today was a serious practice, but everybody was having a good time laughing, smiling. So it's just a great group.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I don't know. Different people deal with different situations different. You could talk to Mike different than you talk to Jack or Jack talk to me. Just knowing that, you just know how to approach your teammates and how to come off correct to them.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"But me and KCP, you can come at me any way. You can spaz on me, you can come nice. I'm going to take it the same way. If that helped this group, for both of us, then I think we did a pretty good job.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, I haven't thought about it too much. I think I'll think about it when we're done. But obviously it's been a great season, been a great decision to come here and play with these guys. It's been a perfect fit. I'm happy I chose here. Coach actually asked me what my contract was like for next year. But I haven't thought about the future, other than the Finals, yet.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, you dream about being in situations like this. I never really used to watch the Finals. The only time I did watch it is when I was growing up and was a Celtics fan and they were there. But now approaching it, it's crazy. My phone has been blowing up ever since the sweep.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,I can't wait for it to get started.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Maybe a little bit, but it's a whole different year. The Celtics have a different coach. But I played them last year, so I kind of know -- I played the Celtics a lot the last few years, so kind of know some of their players.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,But maybe. We'll see.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Oh, last year? Yeah, it was just fit, and then they basically said what I wanted to hear because I wanted to get out of that 4 man, big-man role, floater game, and show what I can do. The first time they said you can come here and be a guard because Jamal was coming off injury and Mike was coming off injury, and that's exactly what I wanted to hear. So that was a perfect fit.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I would say just vibes in the locker room after practice. Usually the last few teams I've been on, practice is over, everyone showers and everyone gets out. But here I sit in my locker for like 30, 40 minutes like it's college, just joking, laughing and having a good time with the fellas. Some of them leave early because they have families, obviously, but when they don't have to go home right away we just sit in the locker room cracking jokes and having a good time.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, he's just the ultimate leader, ultimate professional, comes in every day, works extremely hard and holds everyone accountable. But he is the only one on this team who has won a championship. He knows what it takes and what we need to do. We've got to listen to that guy.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, definitely. As I said, me growing up a Celtics fan, watching the NBA Finals when they were there, it would be insane. Like I said, when they had me mic'd up, the Playoffs in L.A., I'm watching the Celtics play L.A. in the Finals, and obviously this last round we played the Lakers. It would be great. I'd be in front of my family, my people back where I went to high school.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"But if we did go back to Boston, there would be a lot of tickets, so it would be really expensive.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I think coming into the year, we always knew we had a chance to be here, and we've proved it all year. There's been ups and downs, for sure, but the biggest thing we improved on was defense. Early in the year it was nonexistent kind of, or some games it was there and some games it wasn't. But on the defensive end, we got a lot better.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,Not that I could remember now. But yeah.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Obviously just being a guard. I didn't show that I could be a guard in Brooklyn, but here I'm majority playing backup 1, you could say. In the biggest minutes of the game I'm on the floor, contributing on both ends of the floor. I think the biggest question was can I score outside of being with those two great players I played with last year, and I've proven that.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, so the rumors coming into free agency last year was I was getting a lot offers, which I wasn't. Nobody really wanted me because they didn't know if I could be a guard or not. I kind of took it personal. But I knew after the season, the way I played in Brooklyn, it wouldn't fit or people would question how I played.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"So I kind of told my agent that I was going to get F'd this summer. I already knew it. So I just came in with a chip on my shoulder. Denver came in and said the right things, and it clicked. It was a perfect fit.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I think it was very easy. I think right away it clicked maybe. I just think I had to be more aggressive. I was kind of passive toward the beginning of the year, trying to pick my spots. But my teammates told me to be aggressive, be me, nobody can guard me out there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,So I think it was an easy fit to move to backup point guard.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, that would definitely be cool. Would probably practice at the U, be around Coach L and all those guys down there, and I could finally congratulate them for making it to the Final Four in person.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,BRUCE BROWN JR,"But I loved my two years at Miami, so it would be great.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,MARK WILLIAMS,"Yeah, on the offensive end, an athletic big guy, someone that is catching lobs and finishing everything around the rim, running the floor. And then obviously on the defensive end, providing that rim protection. Blocking shots, altering shots, protecting the paint and doing all those things. Just doing whatever it takes to win.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,MARK WILLIAMS,"Really excited. Obviously, he's a great point guard. He can make plays and can score and can do a little bit of everything. So I'm really excited for that.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I'm just super excited to get going. Looking forward to being done with this whole chaotic process. I'm just ready to work hard. Super excited.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JALEN WILLIAMS,"First thing I'm going to buy, hopefully somewhere to live, and then probably a dog. I'm kind of looking and trying to get a dog.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JALEN WILLIAMS,"I mean, Shai, and it's kind of ironic that we'll be on the same team now. But I think we have the same type of play style, so I think it'll be cool to compete against him in practice every day.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JALEN WILLIAMS,"I mean, first, try not to ugly cry when you hear your name get called. It's kind of a surreal moment and it's hard to really put into words.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JALEN WILLIAMS,I worked out with them probably a couple weeks ago now. I had a really good workout and the vibes were really good and it was a really competitive environment going forward. So I really enjoyed working out there.,,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think just defensive fire. I think everybody can score the ball. I think just being able to be versatile on defense, as well, and bring that competitive spirit into that gym.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JALEN WILLIAMS,"Oh, absolutely. I think it's a dope experience. He's super talented. It's kind of cool that we get to go through this experience together now instead of being enemies on the court.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,For sure. One thing I'm going to bring is defense. That's what I like to do. That's what they need. I love to defend.,,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,"The one thing I'm going to work on is my shot. If I can get more consistent in my shot, keep getting my reps up in my free time, just getting a lot of shots up and getting a lot of workouts in. That's what I love to do.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,I worked out with them. Interviewed at Chicago.,,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,"It was good. I worked out with Malaki Branham, my new teammate. That's good. That's crazy to be his teammate. That workout went good. We competed. I feel like that was the best workout that I ever went against -- Malaki, Dyson, Wendell, Bryce McGowens, Ryan Rollins. We competed and that's what we love to do. Overall, it was a good workout.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,"I fit good. They drafted Josh Primo and they developed him. I feel like the San Antonio Spurs are a big develop team organization, and to be going there is a big blessing.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,The first thing I'll buy with an NBA paycheck is my own car. I never owned my own car. To own my own car is going to be special for me.,,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,"I look forward to playing against Ja Morant. He's a good player, fast, gets to the basket, athletic. So guard him, it's going to be good.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,"Yeah, for sure. If I got to go down there and they call me to the G League, let's do it. I'm going to get more reps and learn from the other guys that are there. It's all about learning. I love to learn from other people to make me better. So, yeah, G League is good.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BLAKE WESLEY,"Just excited to be here. They may not know me but, I'm a funny guy, outgoing, love the fans. Get along with everybody. So Spurs fans, you're going to love me.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,PEYTON WATSON,"First thing I'm going to buy, I ain't really put too much thought into it. I was just really focused on getting drafted first. But probably something like a car or to move my mom wherever I live.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,PEYTON WATSON,"And then you said player I want to play against? Most definitely KD. That's my childhood idol growing up, and I can't wait to match up with him.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,PEYTON WATSON,"Well, I mean, clearly they know what they are doing. Sam Presti, great GM. I've had some conversations with them and they are really looking forward to putting their stamp on this season and getting some wins. I can't wait to add to that and try to help us win.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,PEYTON WATSON,"Yeah, just really getting to know each other, getting to know me as a teammate, as a player. I didn't do a lot of interviews my freshman year, so people want to know my personality and what I'm like in the locker room, as well.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"No, not at all. I actually talked to Houston on the phone when they called and everything. So once they told me I was heading there, I knew it was a trade. I wasn't really too worried about it.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"The two other guys they have taken, we played in the same conference in college. So I'm familiar with their games. Me and Jabari played a little bit in high school together in a camp, so I know how he plays as well. I feel like us three are going to jell really good together.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"I know a few guys that are already on the team as of right now. So I feel like I can just go in there and connect with the guys on and off the court and it's going to be an easy transition. Houston is a pretty fun city, so we're going to make sure Toyota Center is full and going to turn up.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"Yeah, so some of the guys that I've known for a minute now, Josh Christopher, Jalen Green, Daishen Nix. I knew actually Josh Christopher and Jalen Green since like the sixth grade, just us playing in California every weekend during AAU. Just seeing their faces and talking to them, I'm really well connected with them. I know them on a personal level. So that's pretty cool.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"I mean, every player wants to be a top pick, high pick and stuff like that. As I was falling, I wasn't really stressing about it. It only takes one team to believe in you, and you can go out there and shock the world. That's kind of my mindset on it. I always bet on myself, so I'm just going to go out there with a chip on my shoulder and remember all the teams that skipped me.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JEREMY SOCHAN,"I'm very excited. I think I'll bring a lot of versatility to the team, energy and fight and passion. I'm really excited.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JEREMY SOCHAN,"Right, exactly. I think the Spurs, the best team, they've won the most, and they play as a team. I think that's what I'm about, so yeah.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JEREMY SOCHAN,"I think just all around the person I am, and then on-court stuff I think I just showed that I can be a really good fit for them.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JEREMY SOCHAN,First thing I'm going to buy is a driving license and then a car. I'm looking forward to playing everyone. I can't wait to play every day and just work and compete.,,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JEREMY SOCHAN,"It meant a lot. I feel like they were stressing a little bit, too. But I feel like we were very aware of the situation, and what happens, happens. You can't control it. I feel like the vibes were really positive.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JEREMY SOCHAN,Definitely. I think I'm going to fit really well. It's a really young squad. We have a lot of energy. I feel like they were one of the best teams in assists. I really feel like I really fit with that. I feel like it's going to be good.,,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JABARI SMITH JR,"No, everybody in the NBA is similar. Everybody wants to win. Everybody is easy to get along with.

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JABARI SMITH JR,"You know you just want to hear your name called, and when it happens you get a little relief, emotions settle in. After that, it's just a whole new life. You're a part of a new team, new family. So got to put it behind you and just go forward.",,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,SHAEDON SHARPE,"Well, originally I played football. I went from hockey to playing football and then basketball. But I mean, I just found the love playing basketball with friends and family. We would play outside, in the gym at the Y. I just fell in love with it.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,SHAEDON SHARPE,I feel like basketball is taking over in Canada just because we've had many draft picks come out of Canada.,,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,KEEGAN MURRAY,"For me, I'll have that chip on my shoulder no matter what. I know that greatness takes time and I know that I have a long ways to go in my development as a basketball player, so for me it's being able to be the best version of myself and get down there and see what happens. I really think it'll be good.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,KEEGAN MURRAY,"It's a great feeling. Especially to do that in two years. It's special. I've grown up next to University of Iowa, live 25 minutes away from it growing up. To have that under my belt I feel like is really special because a lot of great players have came through.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,KEEGAN MURRAY,"For me, I wear it with pride. It's just it builds for future generations, for the Iowa basketball program, and it shows that you can come here and be special. It's not the most glamorous place in the world, but we get the job done.",,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"Some players I like to model my game after are Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown. I feel like they're two really good comparisons for me, but also they're just two-way players and they're like dogs inside of them.",,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,WALKER KESSLER,"You know, I'm ecstatic. I'm excited for the opportunity.

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"I think I'm going to have to work to improve my shot, my passing game, my running, too. I think I have to improve on my post play, too, offensive play, because I'm more a defensive player. Sometimes I'm thinking too much what I'm going to do on offense. Even if I have a good read, I have to make a quicker decision.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,I really look at Bam Adebayo's game because he can do everything on the court. It's a goal to be like that.,,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,NIKOLA JOVIC,"I don't think we are that familiar. I think our basketball IQ and passing, I think that's the two things that we can kind of compare.

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JADEN IVEY,"I mean, after the workout, it was a great workout and I really liked the organization. I really had no clue where I was going to end up at. When I heard my name called, it was crazy.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JADEN IVEY,"That question comes up a lot. I actually never really played my mom one-on-one. She was a coach. Her being a coach, I was trying to get all the help I can get, trying to learn new moves. Anything I can get from her, I would ask her for.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,JADEN IVEY,"Definitely Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, guys that have the speed and athleticism. I feel like I've been working on my mid-range a lot more this summer and I feel like I can showcase that as well. Players like Michael Jordan and D-Wade.",,,,

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,CHET HOLMGREN,"On both ends. I'll start on defense. On defense, I can use my length and my quickness to cover a lot of ground and take up space.

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,CHET HOLMGREN,"And on offense, OKC plays a very five-out style of basketball. There's a lot of space, especially in the paint to get to the basket or draw two defenders or drive and kick, find guys who are open. Like you said, a lot more space, and it opens up.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,CHET HOLMGREN,"I haven't really thought about that yet, as far as -- I'll probably end up buying a place to live. That will probably be the first thing.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,CHET HOLMGREN,"But playing against, it will be special to share the court with Jalen Suggs again.

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, I have a lot of motivations myself. I'm very intrinsically motivated. I wake up every day with a plan on how to make myself a better person, better basketball player.

2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, I try to live with as few expectations as possible, so I can just completely be in the moment.

It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,08-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,14-Jun,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,08-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place.",,,,
2022 - NBA DRAFT,23-Jun,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.,,,,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,16-Jun,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,13-Jun,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,06-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned.",,,,
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,10-Apr,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,11-Jun,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot.",,,,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,09-Jun,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,26-May,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be.",,,,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,18-Oct,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,11-Jun,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,08-Jun,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,17-Jun,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,11-Jun,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,12-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,09-Jun,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level.",,,,
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,10-Apr,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,09-Jun,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,12-Jun,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.,,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,03-Jun,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,12-Jun,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy.",,,,
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,10-Apr,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,09-Jun,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,29-May,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,06-Jun,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession.",,,,
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,06-Jun,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course.",,,,
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,01-Jun,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that.",,,,

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow.

That's the quote I live by.",,,,

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,31-May,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with.

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,08-Jun,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought.
