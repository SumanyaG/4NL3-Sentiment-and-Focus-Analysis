2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"But he was a legend. We all going to miss him. He's the logo, so... He was an amazing player. I wasn't born yet, but I saw some highlights. He was an amazing player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think I've made that play from beginning of the season or before the season even started. I told myself that I wanted to just maximize my defensive potential, and I wanted to make First Team All-Defense going into the season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, that didn't happen, but to be able to be in these moments and show your defensive versatility, picking guys up, guarding guys in the post, guarding contested threes, switching on, it's been big for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But we have a lot of great defenders on this team. So it's been a full team effort, but that's something I definitely took personal going from last year to this year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"No, KP didn't talk to us, but we've been playing all season and all playoffs without KP. So it wasn't any surprise for anybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,Obviously we'd love to have KP out there. We are different when he is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But X stepped in that role, and I thought he was great. Defensively I thought he was stellar, and that big shot he made in the corner, I just knew it. I just knew when I drove, they were going to help, and he was going open. And I trusted it all the way. I just knew it was going in. I don't know how to tell you. It was just like a divine experience. I knew X was going to make that shot, and he did. That was big for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,I thought X was great.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was a great team win. That lead dwindled fast. I know we were up 20, and then they stormed back. And that's what the beauty of basketball is. You can never let up. It's always time, and they were able to cut the lead."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But in those moments, those are the moments which you have to just live for. We've been in those moments a lot. We just needed to be patient, be poised. I feel like we got some good looks. The defensive intensity ramped up. Officiating, you know, got a little bit tighter. So at the end of the day, you've just got to make plays. I thought we got some good looks down the line in the fourth. Some went in. Some didn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But we were able to make plays and find a way to win. And we've been in those positions, and we've lost. It was great to overcome that with my brother, Jayson, and with our team. That was special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Luka is a great player. I'm going to start by saying that. He does a lot for their team. Offensively has the ball in his hands a lot. It's a tough lift for him. He's been tough. Even with that fourth quarter, those stats, he's still been able to pretty much get to whatever he wants."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"So we've just got to continue to be better, and that's all I could really say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, sometimes success can be almost not -- I don't want to say a bad thing, but just being able to finish that quarter where we were up 20. You know, start of the fourth, they came out and made some plays. I checked out around that time, and around that fourth quarter, they just stormed all the way back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, you know, it's like that in basketball. Sometimes when you are winning, comfort kind of sets into your mind. You kind of like relax. Your brain kind of wants to go at ease, and you've got to fight that. You've got to fight that temptation to fall into that because it's still time left to be played and other teams are still competing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"And I think even though that lead dwindled fast, we found ways and moments to overcome it. In that fourth quarter I was proud of, we made some big-time plays. Jrue Holiday, D-White, JT was physical, aggressive. Got to the paint, and we were able to finish it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"To answer your first question, I feel like in the first half, I feel like we had some good looks, some good reads. I was finding guys, getting to the paint, getting up into the offense. I was a little bit -- I was letting them off the hook."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like they were letting me just have open looks from three, and I was taking the first one and I should have been a little more patient. I was a little bit more patient in the second half of letting the game kind of come to me a little bit more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But it's awesome. I mean, I can't -- I don't even really have words. It kind of doesn't even really feel real right now. I'm just trying to stay in the moment. It feels great to be up 3-0 in the series but the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,Just seeing what the game is giving me and making the right play. I feel like we got a bunch of great looks. Good things happen when I get to the paint. Sometimes I don't always get to assist. Sometimes it's a hockey assist.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,But I just like making the defense converge. You have to respect them getting to the basket. And we have a lot of great shooters. I was committed to that all night.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I feel like in the first half I could have done it more and I settled for some shots because I have like a big on me. You know, I needed to get to the paint a little bit more. And I did that in the second half, and then in the fourth quarter, and I feel like that's what helped us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"The coaching staff has been fantastic all season long. I've been saying that throughout the regular season, even before we got to the playoffs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just it's been just super organized. We've walked through all different types of scenarios. We've been like overly prepared and making sure that we know. Sometimes it's like you've got the coaches, they game plan, but they don't always let you know exactly what they are thinking. Like, they tell us everything. Super transparent. And we trusted it. We trust it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought that's been great. Joe has been a big reason of that, and he showed himself in these playoffs. He's been coaching his ass off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think definitely it's been some growth, but I think this team has trusted me, especially in this playoffs and those moments to just be who I am."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like I've been able to just deliver just by being just being patient and being poised. Those opportunities have presented themselves, and I've been able to take advantage of them. But I give all my credit to my teammates for the trust they had in me to have the ball in my hands and to be able to make those plays."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just being aggressive. You know, running that action with the ball in my hands to finish the third, I wanted to make sure that we got a good quality look."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"So if they would have overhelped, I would have been ready to kick it out. I saw that I had been making those passes in the first half, and they didn't want to give those threes up. So they kind of were in between, and when I seen that, it was lights out. So I just went up and finished it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Experience is the best teacher. All year long we've been hearing about the Celtics are the past, for the last six to eight months, that's all we've been hearing is all the different shortcomings we've had in the past."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"This is a new team, you know what I mean. We've learned from those experiences. And in these moments, you can see that we learned from it. We stepped up to the plate, and we found a way to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, he's a great person, a great player, and he's doing everything he possibly can to help us win and help get back with us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"No, not at all. I mean, he's just a highly competitive person, and he's doing everything he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say his attitude has ever changed, even when he got hurt in Miami, he still was smiling in the locker room after that. His mindset, his attitude has always stayed the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Just means someone is going to have to step up. We trust every single person on this team, and like you said, they've stepped up this whole postseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Whoever we put out there, we understand they might not be what KP is, but they're going to do whatever it takes to help us win games. I have just as much trust in whoever we put out there as I do in KP."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Just trying to make it difficult for him. He's obviously a great player, and just trying to make him take tough shots. We expect him to play better, so it's going to be more of a challenge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"We're just trying to get a good look every time. We don't have a number we need to hit, but just go out there, making the right read, making the right pass, and just getting a good look every time down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, it's how we attack the basket, just get in the paint, crash the defense, try to make the right pass and the right read off of that. I would say that's been our offense the whole year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, every game you can learn from and just understand that it's going to get tougher each and every game. The things we did in Boston might not work this game, so just being able to make the adjustments that we need to and just trust that whatever adjustments they make, we've got an answer for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be crazy in here. We've just got to stick together, and I'm sure we're going to have a lot of Boston fans, too. It'll be fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Just sprinting back, trying to make a play. I don't really have a fear of getting dunked on, so that's kind of part of it. Then just trusting the instincts. Just trying to sprint back and trying to stop a basket any chance I can. I've just kind of been doing it for a while."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a learned experience. Over time you learn how to deal with all the extra noise and attention, whether it's positive or not so positive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, I'm a fair, smart person. I know when I'm doing things at a high level. I know when I need to do certain things better. So I'm not, like, oblivious to what's going on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"At the same time, just keeping the main thing the main thing and focusing on trying to win the next game. That's what's most important at this time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, that's part of it, right? You never, like, completely shut a guy as talented as him out. You've heard it a million times great players, try to make things difficult, show them different coverages, make them work for everything. They're going to make some shots. They're going to miss some shots. You just don't want it to be easy for them to be comfortable. That's with any talented player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,I'm a big Matthew fan? We went to school together. I actually watched him win last night. Trying to learn and understand the rules in the game of hockey more and more.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I got to watch the game last night. They won. Like I said, I'm extremely happy for him and his family. Hopefully they win it all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I think being in the Finals two years ago has helped me in this moment. Like I said, I understand that I do need to be more efficient. I do need to shoot the ball better, I would not disagree with anybody on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,But I'm not letting it bother me. I'm still trying to find ways to impact the game and dominate the game in other areas.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I understand that it could take one game. One game, I could explode. All the percentages and things like that could change. So it's just that mindset of I'm one game away or whatever that means."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Like I said the other day, I know what it's like to be in this position and lose. This time around, trying to do any and everything possible to have a different outcome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"So, yes, I know I need to shoot the ball better. And I plan on it. Not letting that affect everything else that I need to do on the court to help us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Yes, that's one thing where I truly do appreciate Joe, aside from being I think an excellent coach, is that I truly do believe that he cares about us, our team as individuals, obviously myself, the conversations that we have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"He always, through the season, the summertime, obviously through this postseason, has had days where he's called me, called me into his office. Not necessarily talk about X's and O's, but check on me as a person, how I'm dealing with everything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"That does mean a lot for somebody to take time out of his day to show that compassion or whatever, just know that he's there for me. That relationship between yourself and a coach is important. That's something I truly value about the relationship that me and Joe have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, that's just another thing. I think Joe always challenges, in particular me and J.B., to find different ways to affect the game. I think J.B. has taken that up another notch of his conditioning, his ability to essentially chase down and guard guys, like I said, 90 feet from the basket."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"That's just another way that, obviously, besides his scoring and things like that, that he can positively impact the game that gives us the best chance to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"We're just so much of a better team when we have him. 7-4 unicorn, right? He's as talented as they come. Presents so many matchup problems on the offensive end. Then on the defensive end, somebody that can affect shots, protect the rim as well as he does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"So, yes, we've had success and found ways to win without him. Obviously, we're better when he's on the team, when he's out there playing with us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Obviously, he's day to day, doing everything he can to get out there and give us whatever he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to put us in the predicament where it's like I'm shooting not as well, still we can win. I want to shoot the ball well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"But I feel I just keep saying it. That's not the only thing that I bring to the table, not being defined by that. Earlier in my career, I was a score the ball and rebound type of guy. How much I've grown and developed as a player, reading the game, understanding what the defense is trying to take away, giving up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"It's such a long season that you're not going to make every shot. You're not going to shoot as well as you would like to. The guys that I've studied, the best of the best players, have always just found a way. That's just all I've been trying to do, is find a way to do whatever I can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think that's very good. It's how we come out for Game 3. Got to be the more desperate team. I think if we take care of business and really come out with a purpose, we'll be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,For sure. We're looking forward to it. We like playing on the road. It'll be a good environment to play in.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Definitely.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Well, I didn't go straight to the scorer's table, but I did get Joe's attention or Charles' attention, too, and then they told me get in. I guess you could kind of say I did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"For sure. I think Ive earned that right a little bit to show that I'm able to take those shots, even if they were very difficult. I don't care about my shooting percentage as far as that. I could have been 0 for 9 if I missed that. But that could have been the difference, and who knows from here on out. Maybe that helps me jump start to make the next couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I don't practice them, but I just look at them, and I don't know, I probably zone in more on them. Just like clock is winding down, and you've got nothing to lose."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's special for sure, just the energy the crowd had got us jump started us to start the fourth well. Built momentum. Yeah, those are moments you live for on this type of stage, so that was big time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I probably blacked out a little bit, but like I said, it's just moments that you dream of, of hitting shots like that with the clock winding down. Hopefully I can continue to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Al is in the middle of watching Game of Thrones right now, so a lot of us have seen that. I just re-watched Yellowstone with my fiance and my brother for the third time, so I went through and watched that, also. I love that show."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"What happened? I mean, the tweet that we put out was pretty explanatory. It's kind of a random situation. I felt something, and now I have to deal with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"As we said, yeah, it's going to be day-to-day, and I'll see how I am tomorrow, and obviously I'm going to do everything I can to be out there tomorrow, and we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I am, of course. I have to be. I'm optimistic, and as I said, I will do everything I can to be out there tomorrow. Yeah, we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know. I don't know the specifics. But that's something I'll leave in the medical staff's hands to determine whether I can go or no. But from my side, as I said, nothing is going to stop me unless I'm told I'm not allowed to play. That's the only reason I would not be out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, I don't care. I've been through some stuff in my career, and obviously this is a rough patch coming back and having something happen right away again. It's tough. It's very -- just a tough moment right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,But I'm feeling pretty good. I'm feeling pretty good. Mind is good. We'll see tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know. It was kind of a random situation. It wasn't like I was limping or something I did before this. I was good, and then this happened. I don't think it's anything related, and I don't know, either. The medical staff would know better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,It is what it is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I'm living by those words. Of course."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, I hope not, but if it comes to that to win, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I was going for a rebound at the free throw line. Just kind of pushed in Lively's back and we bumped knees and something happened. I just kept playing for a while after that. Obviously towards the end my movement was affected a bit. Joe took me out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Some black magic, no? No, I'm joking. No, the first time I came back, I was not playing that game, I was with Washington, and I had a warm welcome here. They even did a tribute video, which was very unexpected for me, but that was very nice. I think the organization, the people on the inside appreciated my time here, and that was very nice. Obviously, I have completely no bad feeling about this place. I love this city, love the fans, and it just didn't work out. I definitely don't expect a comeback like I had in New York. But we'll see tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's pretty close. I think because of the type of player that he is, it's always going to look different because of his versatility."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's probably why you asked that question. None of the American ones did. They look at the lens differently of basketball. In America, nothing is ever good enough. It's about what can you do for me right now. It's not always the case in that situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yes, I think we are. I think he's only going to get better. He makes greatness look easy because of his ability to impact the game in many different ways. He's going to continue to get better and better and better. It's an honor to coach him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, listen, he's doing anything and everything he can to be ready for the game tomorrow. It's a serious injury. At the end of the day, our team and the medical team is not going to put him in any bad situations."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,We've taken the decision to play out of his hands because the importance of him. He's going to do everything can he to play. We're going to leave it up to our medical team. That's really it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the growth of him as a player has been, like, not being defined by one thing. When you have your superstar players knowing what it takes to win, they're willing to take that on. Sometimes it's scoring. Sometimes it's defense. Sometimes it's rebounding, passing, executing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I think one of the major growths of Jalen's game is he'll do whatever it takes to win. That could change each game. That could change each series. He's doing that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"What he would say? He would say, Focus on the details, focus on the fundamentals. The closer you are to winning, the easier it is to become distracted by things that you can't control, things that don't matter. Here are the things that matter, and you got to fight like hell to accomplish those things with simplicity, with discipline and mental toughness."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,Everything he talked about was about your mindset and your mental toughness. That's what separates you.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Thank you for asking the second question. I think it's the most important thing. I think the ability to handle the ebbs and flows, the humility to understand there's a plan that's much bigger than who you are individually. Have an impact on other people. Then using the gifts God has given you to try to impact people."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's my anchor, the most important thing. I've enjoyed the challenge of trying to stick with that even when it's difficult at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I think he's missed some easy shots. I expect him obviously to be even more aggressive and to fight to get those shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,The most important thing is just being detailed in individual defense. It's not about shutting him down. It's about just making it difficult for him because of his ability to impact plays.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,So we just have to fight for that. He's gotten some good looks. I think we have to guard him better. He's definitely going to be more aggressive. We have to be better at individual defense. We have to be better at our team defense. We have to be better at our details.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the biggest thing is when you get someone and you realize that everything everybody says about them is true, that's probably one of the ultimate compliments you can get. Your character is what it is. It's what you say it is, what other people say it is. I'd say that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Everything everyone said about him when we first got him, it's been even better. Just the type of person that he is. His humility, his competitive nature, the way he treats his family, the way he treats his teammates, how hard he plays, his willingness to do everything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I didn't see it. It is out of his hands. It's his job to fight like hell to put himself in the best possible position to feel as good as he can. We're not going to let him compromise himself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's been it. To say, We need you, do everything you can, but at the end of the day we got your back and make sure we put you in the best position possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I have no idea.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,Criticism is the ultimate beauty. It's a sign of ultimate respect. It's just a beautiful thing. I really love the way Jayson has handled that. It's just a testament to who he is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Shot selection is all about timing. It just depends on the time and score, depends on the spacing, the type of play we ran to get the shot that we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Nobody knows what's a good shot and what's not except the people in our locker room, because those are the ones that we talk about every single day. We know how important shot selection is. I think the greatest strength of our team is they fight to take the right shot every single time down the floor. They know what a right shot is. They know the importance of how the shot will impact your defense. It will impact or offense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"On that particular shot, that was a good shot because we were in offensive rebounding position, the floor was balanced, we had the matchup that we wanted. It allowed us to do both to offensive rebound and get back in transition."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think you just try to learn, try to look at different lenses. I think everybody tries to look at the game the same way. The more you can look at it from a completely different spectrum, it allows you to build connections. It allows you to really focus on where games are really won and lost, and not on the stuff that's easy to notice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think everyone notices the easy things. It's can you fight to notice the things other people aren't, because you know that's where winning and losing is, is in that space."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Try to use different things to keep the guys engaged. It's a long year. If you keep talking to them about game plans, it gets stagnant."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"You try to build connections. You figure out what's one thing that can grab the guys' attention for an extra 10 seconds, something outside of basketball that you think can hammer home a point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"At the end of the day, that's the most important thing, is making sure you get through to your guys so they listen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I try to be like peers with all of our guys. The age gap is relatively there. I try to have a peer-like relationship with all of them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Then with each guy it's different, because you can break down different barriers -- who is married, who has kids, whose faith is important. Sometimes it's not for people. So you connect differently."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I've always had an interesting relationship with Jrue because we share the same app, the Hallow app. Before I met him, he was actually on there. I would listen to his prayers. I got to know his heart. Then I coached him in the All-Star Game. I always had this spiritual connection that we would end up in the same area at some point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I kind of felt like I knew him before I knew him just because of the way he prays, and I knew his heart."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Our relationship now is -- sometimes we talk to each other, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we just give a head nod. Sometimes I see his wife, I give them a hug sees my wife, give them a hug. That's it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"You're talking about football, okay. I just want to see if I got you right. I think Neymar has handled the most pressure lately. But because we had a lack of idols most recently. If you are back in 2002, we had Ronaldo, had Rivaldo. We had a great national team. This talent has gone down for the years. Neymar has surged like a huge talent. We put a lot of expectations on him that he can deliver to us another World Cup. I don't think it's pretty fair to him what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I agree. I would say the same thing for Tatum. Also, he's the first No. 10 to take on the weight of Brazil since the social media era. Who before Neymar was involved in that social media area? He's so good, everything you can do can be taken for granted. When he won the gold medal by making the game-winning penalty kick, you would have thought that would have solidified it. It hasn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Most recently, yes. I have a particular opinion, but I have to see the general thing about it, about Neymar. I don't agree of a lot of his actions outside the field."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know him. All I know is the soccer player.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,We should just focus on the soccer player. I don't think that's fair.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Don't get me into the coaches. I mean, don't get me into the football coaches, right? That's like an impossible job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"It's a lot of pressure. It's a huge country. We love football, we love soccer. It's our sport. We were always good at it. It's a lot of pressure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,JOE MAZZULLA Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,Most recently the results were so bad that the pressure is just rising.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I study that a lot because I think we're in a similar environment here as to how to handle all of that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Boston Celtics, probably just from the basketball, as great as the national soccer team. Pretty much the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,JOE MAZZULLA Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,I know you love soccer.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,JOE MAZZULLA Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"I know you like Pep Guardiola, and I know you stole some things from his thoughts."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,None of us are that good. We steal from everybody.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"Defend the house. When we went out there, we were trying to do what we could. We couldn't get the two wins, couldn't get a win. All right, cool, move on, next play, next game. Now we've just got to bring a different energy, a different light and a different positivity coming into Game 3."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY ii,"Just really getting out in pace. I feel like whenever they slow us down and we end up playing one-on-one, we can't get into our pick-and-roll game because the defense was pulled in and they're expecting it. But whenever we are out in transition, I set a high screen at half court, and Tatum doesn't know if he's going to step up or Porzingis doesn't know if he's going to step up, that's the game we need to get into. Just being able to move the ball, get out and run and make sure that we're not so stagnant with the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's just understanding the defensive principles. Instead of me protecting the paint, it's me rotating to either wing or rotating to the corner. It's just understanding where you are on the floor, understanding if you see where you need to rotate, it's getting there. There was one time Jaylen Brown cut, I was supposed to rotate corner. I thought he was there, but he was at the rim. It's just always moving your head, keeping your head on a swivel and understanding where you are and who's in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"They're going to be loud. I honestly didn't think it was that loud. There was a bunch of rumors about how Boston is going to be so loud, so nasty. I thought it was going to be worse. So just knowing that, it just makes you want to go out there and perform in front of your own crowd."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"Come out there, punch them in the mouth. I feel like we were doing a great job of guarding them, a great job of just going shot for shot with them the majority of the game. A lot of the game just came down to us not being as sound on the defensive end in the fourth quarter, us making free throws and us being able to take care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like whenever you're in games like this, you find out who you really are. You understand what you really want out of this, who you really are, just understanding that whenever you're on the bench, you're here, your teammates just lock into the game. There's nothing else going on in the world that can take your focus away from what's going on in the Finals. There's no other feeling you want to be in and no other place you want to be in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, it's kind of hard to make sure I don't slip up and say anything too inappropriate. But I'm just out there trying to make sure my people hear me. Everybody on the team knows that if I'm mic'd up, making sure you don't say anything too crazy to me. But they know I'm going to talk to them on the defensive side, talk to them on the offensive side, and even if they fall down, I'm picking them back up and giving them positive words of encouragement."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, I feel like they keep coming back to me because they like what they're getting, so I'm going to continue to put on a show, continue to do what I do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just continue to be aggressive. Try to win each possession. Try to win the little battles -- the rebounding game, the diving on the floor, the loose balls, all the little things are going to come down to a win. It's not just the big shots. It's not just the big plays. It's the little plays that are going to give us the boost to give us the extra steps that we need so we can get a breath of fresh air."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,Maxi Kleber,"Like any other time, you have to make sure you stay composed. Its a long series and you want to make sure you play the right way and play your game and dont get affected by outside noise."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"I think its not about any individual person. I think its overall on the offensive side, creating the space so Kyrie and Luka have it a little easier to create shots for themselves and for us. So we just have to make sure we have the right spacing and putting guys in position to succeed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, but even if not, Ky makes great decisions for us. Even if he has an off shooting night or whatever, it doesnt mean that he played bad for us. We know he has a high IQ, but we can give him a little more space to get some easy ones to create a rhythm."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"Its the Finals and you try to take away a lot of things. You contest every shot and make it harder on both sides for both teams. If we have the right spacing and involve the right guys, we can get the shots that we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"We have to take the energy from all the fans and bring it to the court. Come out with the right attitude and get the win. If youre at home, you have to take advantage of it, just like Boston did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think he's one of the best players in the world. You're trying to just make it tough. That's all you can do, is hopefully guard the first move, guard the second move, guard the third move and contest. Guys are doing that at a high rate, trying to make it tough on him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought Exum did a great job in Game 2. We'll look to see if we can get that combination out there a little bit more as a third ball handler. Defensively, I thought he did a really good job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,He's one of the few that has made a three in this series. He knocked down the open three. We're going to need that a little bit more from him.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,I thought the pace he came with was really good.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their defense, just understanding -- I thought Luka did a great job of getting off to a great start scoring. It's just understanding who's on and who he's involving in the pick-and-roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"We have to do a little bit better job of that. Again, he's getting where he wants to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"That's what they say. We're home. Understanding that Boston held serve, that's what we're talking about, is just focusing on Game 3. We felt in Game 2 we had opportunities we just let get away from us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"For us at home, protecting home court. But the cliche is role players play better at home, so we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"It's easy, just say relax. I think the urgency started for us awhile back. I think we're used to that. I think the game of basketball is about makes and misses and capitalizing on mistakes. We just haven't had that opportunity to capitalize. We're getting stops. We're turning the ball over, give up a three. Understand coming down the stretch we had to play perfect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Hopefully the game is close coming down the stretch and we can capitalize on their mistakes. But there's two teams playing, so we can relax and enjoy this and have fun. That's what it's all about. Hopefully we can do that tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"You look at White and Holiday are comfortable -- Holiday is very comfortable in the dunker. He plays as the big. Being able to not just put the ball in the basket, but also to be a playmaker from that position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"He's a willing passer. When you talk about a point guard or a versatile guard, those two can playmake from there. So they put a lot of pressure. It's a little different when you have smalls in the dunker."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"For us, we had to do a little bit better job of understanding who is down there. Again, Boston is a very talented team when you talk about the four around one. They have four shooters on the perimeter. They can playmake. They're very willing passers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Sometimes in this league you've got to give up something. Right now, they're taking advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"This is an incredible atmosphere. To win that championship in 2011, the city is incredible. They love their Mavs. To win it then and now to be here in '24 is special because you don't really get an opportunity to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"I understand the opportunity that I have to be the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. It's a dream come true. But we're trying right now to figure out how to win one game, and that's the next one tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,I've been saying it all year failure is the best teacher at times. It can inspire you to do great things.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"It's our first time being in the Finals as a team with this group. We understand who we're up against, the competitive level, the nature of the Finals, the competitive level we have to play at. Also, the adjustments that we have to make out there on the floor just as players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"The coaching staff is doing a great job of preparing us. But it's our job as players to make those adjustments and play even harder, especially when the game is getting a little out of balance, we have a lead and we want to extend it a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"A lot of it is just a learning curve for myself, for my teammates, and also a peace of mind that we give each other that we want to give ourselves a chance by leaving it all out there on the floor, playing our best, preparing the best way we can. That's literally been the focus since Game 2 ended, was putting our best foot forward, coming back home, feeling familiar, letting our game speak for itself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"First thing of that is just accepting that I haven't played well or up to my standards, as well as I would have liked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Being back in Boston, there's such a level of desire that I have inside of me to play well. Wanted to be there for my teammates. As a competitor, it's frustrating. But I don't want to let that seep in or spill over to any other decisions I have to make there as a player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Continue to feed my teammates' confidence. Have been down 0-2 before -- lost a series, won a series. I know what it takes. Also how to prepare for something, like, that mentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"First is just respecting your opponent, then most importantly putting your best foot forward out there when we go out there. It's as simple as that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"He's been playing great. He's been one of the emotional leaders on the team. Defensively he's making it difficult. That's what he's been doing all year. For the past few years, he's tried to make his mark on that end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I can be a lot more fundamentally sound, technical on my shots, not get into the paint often where it's three or four guys around me, I'm not making a pass. They're sending specific strategies against me to make it difficult."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,We're at the highest stage in the world. It's a small sample size. We only get a seven-game series potentially. I just can feel the stakes being raised up a little bit more. The pressure is natural. Makes diamonds.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"For us as a team, we just have to control what we can control on that end. Being able to match their pace, but also feel good about ourselves when we get stops. When we get stops, get out in transition, we're a better team. When we're getting stops and giving up offensive rebounds or we're getting stops and turning the ball over, it hurts our chances to even be in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"The margin of their victories hasn't really displayed the full story in terms of the Celtics beating us. We just have to continue to lean in on each other, especially when it gets tough out there. We're going against a great team. They're not going to stop pressing us, stop their pace, stop testing us on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"We know what we're in for. But now we have to raise it to an even higher level, and it starts with me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,Sharing with them that it took a lot of resilience. It took a lot of will to win in 2016. That's also a different team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"We had time to fail together. We had time to go through our trials together. We lost in 2015. A lot of guys came back in 2016 and we won. So there was an inner motivation there. We also knew who we were going against, how well they played."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I think if you have a healthy way or perspective of looking at where we are now, it feels like we are that team that's gaining the experience, that's being able to fail at this level. Now we have an opportunity to respond. That's all you can ask for in a basketball season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"If you asked me in September or October, would I want a chance to be down 0-2 and having a chance to respond in Game 3 or be out of the Playoffs, I think I would choose the former. It's as simple as that in terms of putting it in perspective."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,We're the only teams left. This is about chess. That's all it is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think it starts with just being aware of your own goals, what you want to accomplish, your team goals, how you can help accomplish that. Also what's going to bring you peace of mind off the court when you leave it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Some of us would say family, video games, other business entrepreneurial opportunities. Just helping you have a healthy balance with the game. The game is going to be a game. It's going to torment you emotionally. You're going to fail, succeed, make shots, miss shots. You want to be able to go home to a great family, people that love you unconditionally, those that are going to be truthful with you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm grateful I've been able to build a tribe around me that has all those. Dealing with a lot of the criticism, when you're young, even when you're older, how to accomplish something like I'm trying to do right now, there's going to be a lot of people that want to see you fail. Get used to that too. There are going to be a lot of people that are going to be naysaying, want to see you kind of destroy yourself in the process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I would say just focus on the people that really love you for you. Your teammates are there to support you, especially when you know them throughout. Then trusting the people that have been there before you. They'll give you a lot of advice to help you reason or rationalize what's going on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question, brother. It took me awhile to figure that out and find that peace of mind. That's why you get a chance to see me up there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I definitely want to see you accomplish that peace of mind a lot earlier than I had to. It's not worth it to let anybody's opinions get to the best of you. Or people that have never been in our position don't know what it takes, don't know the sacrifices, never will, but they guess, and they try to make it up. Show them respect, but at the same time understand that we're all human at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it started with me just telling my hermano I got to play better for him, alongside him. In order for us to accomplish our goal, we both have to be playing well and we both have to be doing the little things, doing whatever it takes to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Easy conversation. But it started with me reaching out, just letting him know it's my fault, taking accountability for not playing particularly well. But also I got to continue to trust my guys around us or around me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I need to have fun in the process. We've gotten this far because we've been a great team, not because we've just put it on me and Luka. It's been a total team, organizational effort to get this far. We just got to keep trusting in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,Pretty simple conversation.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,Rather win smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, we definitely have had some moments of positivity on the defensive end where we've gotten the missed shots. Again, I just remember one play that comes to mind, where potentially we could be down six. Pritchard hits a three going into the fourth quarter where it gives a little bit more breathing room to have the game in their hands."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Just being aware of some of the plays that they're going to try to make at the end of quarters, the plays they make at the start of the game to get them going a little bit, the plays they run when we're in the lead. We've had the lead in the first quarter -- 12-6, 13-6 both times. We're feeling good about ourselves, and they come out and run the same play four times in a row."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Our IQ has to be at a higher level. Also, our communication and trust has to be at an ultimate level where we can just trust our instincts out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,I just know hes going to do everything he can to get on the floor. Hoping for the best.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,Lets see. Well see how everything goes. Just have to wait and see if he is going to play or not. I feel like we have plenty of guys who should be able to come in and help contribute. We just have to wait.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,"He feels pretty good. From what Ive seen, he seems pretty optimistic. For him, were just wishing that he is going to do everything he can to get himself going. Anything that he can give us, well appreciate it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,"For us, its just continuing to do what weve been doing all year. Being consistent on the defensive end. On offense, playing the way we want to play. Just being consistent. Our team has been this all season. Now we have a great opportunity in Game 3 to come in here. We understand its not going to be easy. Its going to be a tough game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Trying to be the hungrier team. We're going to go out there and try and execute a game plan, and I think most of us just try and do it together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP is tough. Whatever decision he makes is his decision. But he's a tough guy. Obviously whatever decision he makes, I'm supportive of it. But that's mostly up to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP always has a great attitude. That's something you don't have to worry about. He's just like this joy and this light. Anytime he walks into a room, no matter what's going on, he brings that every time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's team defense. We do it as a team. It's not just one person, it's everybody. We just try to defend him, we try to show him bodies, multiple people, and just try to make it difficult."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think we still have spacers. I think we try to do our best to get into the right spacing or get into the right positions and try to do as best we can.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's hard. I've sacrificed a lot. I've missed out on a lot of my kids' stuff just to be here. But the journey is cool, and I think just the friends and the family that I've met along the way has made it worth it, and the fact that my family is here with me makes it even more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You've got to talk to him. I can only imagine. It would be tough, right? Missing a lot of the Playoffs and then coming to the Finals and then getting hurt at the end, it would be hard. But KP is a tough guy, and he knows himself very, very well. Again, like I said, he's been bringing this energy and this positivity that he's just always brought, this light, and he'll continue to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think that's been here. I think that trust has been here. That chemistry has been here. We just embodied it from the beginning. That wasn't anything that had to grow over time. That just came naturally.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's not any different. I did it in Milwaukee, too. I'm not really sure people actually knew that but there's a lot of time being in the dunker and trying to space the floor and have the best spacing, but I think for this team, me down there trying to make plays out of the dunker a lot of the time helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Getting the ball to JT and JB. The way they've been playing, the way they've been touching the paint and getting to the basket has been huge for us, and one of the reasons why we had such a good game last game. Again, I think JT driving and attracting two or three people and collapsing the defense has made our offense a lot easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,All I know is that he is working his butt off to try to be ready to go for tomorrow. Thats really all I know.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,"I think that is the beauty of our team. Were friends off the court as well as on the court. Not every team youre on is like that. Every guy gets along with each other. Dach guy individually has his own personality, but it all kind of works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,"He obviously poses a lot of different threats for us and the other team. Wed love to have him out there, but if he cant go, everybody just has to step up. Weve shown we can do it throughout the Playoffs when hes not there to play, but obviously were really hoping he can play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,We just have to be laser focused. I think the biggest challenge is being on the road. Dealing with the fans. Players are usually more comfortable on their home court. We just have to come out and be ready to go.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,Its a must-win for us. We need to come out aggressive and deliver the first punch and make sure were ready to go as a team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"As far as adjustments, I think we need to be a lot better at just overall. Offensively, weve been awful. We know we need to be better. We know what we need to do. Its just about us doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah. The guys are definitely excited to come back to Dallas. Weve been on the road now for a week. Coming home and getting the energy from the crowd, I think its only going to help us. I think were really looking forward to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"I think every single game in every single playoff series is a must-win. But I think for this, we have to win this game. Thats the intent going into this game its a must-win game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"Coach has been good because obviously he has been in this position before and knows what its like as a player, too. Obviously, he has had his message and hes been able to get that across to the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"In saying that, he has also done a great job of being able to hear the players opinions and how we feel like we can fix things. So I think its been a mixture of both. But obviously I think it comes down to aggression and just having trust and confidence in one another."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"We need to make them. Its obviously frustrating not making them, but at the same time, we need to make sure were taking every opportunity, even if we are missing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"At the end of the day, its going to get better. Were not going to keep missing. Its been a big emphasis. Weve been shooting a lot, getting extra reps in. We know what were capable of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"Weve been shooting great throughout the Playoffs. I think its an adjustment. A little bit of jitters in the first game. Its one of those things now, its do or die. We need to make those shots. Thats just how it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, it feels great just to be back on the home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much with me, just the same as coming out from the last game setting the tone physically. Just come out with energy, match everything that they're throwing at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"The only thing I would say they're probably doing differently is just 1 through 5, switching on every screen-and-roll. But we've found ways to get around that. Of course we want to get a lob every now and then, but we can find other options on the floor besides lobs. It's always good because we have a lot more weapons in our arsenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,Just have patience. Not necessarily letting them speed us up and then find the loopholes when it comes to their defense.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like everything matters when it comes to just like being in the Finals in general. Free throws are big, like you said. Making more shots, of course. But like I said, just stay patient with the game, let stuff come to us and not let us get sped up when it comes to what we want on the floor offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It's a blessing to be in a situation like this, coming from the situation that I was in. Just that next step in my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like a segment of some stint of the last game, we found ways to be able to do that. We have to make them take the shots that we want. Once we get to that point and we can do it consistently, I feel like that's when we can make them uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just believe in him. Find ways to get him downhill. At the end of the day, just try to keep him as motivated as possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, it's been a minute, in all honesty, just to have a post-up play for me, for sure, so it is new to me. Most definitely it's just something that me, J-Kidd, anybody else on the team that has seen it, if we see anybody down there when it comes to like a mismatch, I always throw it down there and we can just play out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, for sure. The whole team is helping me. Everybody is having fun because at the end of the day it's the NBA Finals. There are going to be challenges. There's going to be obstacles. There's going to be adversity. We find ways to get through that as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like it's going to be the same. I always loved just coming here and playing with the home crowd involved. I heard it's a sold-out game tomorrow, so hopefully it's going to blow the roof off, most definitely. They should hear us on the other side of Texas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think that the biggest thing is we know they're going to collapse when we drive, so I think the biggest thing for me and what we've talked about is playing off two feet, whether that's a lay-up, going aggressive, or knowing that they're going to collapse and finding open shots. That's the biggest thing going into this game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I'm a guy that no matter the situation in any game, I'm always going to try and put up that shot. Like it happened that other game, I think it was an important basket for them, kind of cut the momentum a little bit going into the quarter. But yeah, I think a lot of the times it's shots that we practice a little bit, and I think we're good enough players to make it. He obviously got lucky on that one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"I've hit a few. I've hit a few. Mine are mostly deep, past half court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"No, actually last year, I actually kind of went through a thing with one of my teammates about kind of a process of what I would do to shoot, and I think he was kind of a launch type, and I'm a shoot. I'll stop off two and kind of shoot and aim it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"But I think credit to Live and Gafford they're playing in a role where they have to defend out on the perimeter, but as much as we can get them back to the basket, we will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"No, I think they have enough guys talking to them. I think it's a lot of process. We've been watching a lot of film and making sure. But I'm confident in their ability."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"No, I think some people get lost in the emotion of everything, and yeah, you have to kind of remind guys to, hey, I'm mic'd up. But I think it's just the moment and everything. Even mic'd up or not, I think guys, we're going to say what we want to say. But I'm always pretty calm, so I won't say too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"First, I feel good. I don't want to get in any more details. But I feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I think it's up a notch, for sure. Both teams played a lot of games throughout the season. But I think the physicality has been on point, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I would say it's different. Just being 18 and 25 is a big difference. But it's different games. Here, you play first to four. In the EuroLeague, it's just one game. It's way different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,I wouldn't just say that game prepared me for now. It's throughout my career that prepared me for these moments.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I saw him before when I started driving. I saw him at that spot. So when I went for the layup, I saw him, I knew he was going to be open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"Very helpful. He can dribble the ball. He can play point guard. He can help us both. Save our energy. He can just bring the ball up. He can make plays, too. It's good that he was able to play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, our defense built in five guys. Our low man is very important. So no matter who is the low man, we know we going to do a great job. We've worked on this the whole season, preseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,I've been in that position a lot with the low man. We've been working on it since preseason. We feel confident with that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"Just one thing Keep shooting. We all believe in those shots. That's how we came to the Finals. That's how we played the whole season. We believe in those guys. Everybody believes. If you're open, just keep shooting. You're going to knock it down at some point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,Just trying to keep getting open looks. I think our defense has not been bad. We can't really score. That's our main problem right now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"But I think we getting some great looks. Like I say, we have confidence everybody can make a shot shooting the ball on our team. We just got to keep believing in it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"You could say that. I like to pride myself that I always try to play with that fire and that passion. I feel like that's what makes me who I am, the essence of why I play and how I play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"But my experiences, the heartbreaks, the losses, have all kind of cultivated into what you see now. I don't want to feel that again. I think that's fair to say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's been fun. Personally, I think it's been necessary. I think anytime you want to achieve something great, it's going to take a little bit of sacrifice from every individual to get to where you want to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Me going into this season, I knew that being one of the leaders, that would be in front of me on my plate. I didn't mind it. It's translated to us being here in the Finals. The sacrifice is necessary not just in sports but in life, if you want to achieve a goal, to some degree."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"For me, it's different for every individual, but it's almost like you got to trick your mind almost in a sense. You almost got to play like you're down 0-2 rather than up. That's hard to do. You got to go into that mind frame, that focus. Now we are playing like that, rather than you let comfort, you let some of those things kind of seep in. You just try to stay focused and try to harness the mind as much as you can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"The mind is a powerful thing. It's hard to grasp some of those things as you are intaking them. If you can kind of focus your mind on what you want it to focus on, you'd be surprised what you can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Gotten to know Jrue a lot. Jrue is, like I described it in the beginning of the season, he's like an assassin. He just has a will and a might about him, how he plays, that he'll die on the battlefield. I'm the same. You recognize that and you respect that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"His will is unbreakable. He's going to show up. He's going to be there. He's going to be in the fight with you. I've been against him on the other side, so you could feel it. You could feel like this dude's not going anywhere."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's where the respect for me and him, just being opponents, but now him being on the same team, it's an honor. It's been an honor to be his teammate because of how he carries himself. His willingness to sacrifice, his willingness to adapt, and then be successful where he's adapting to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"For example, this year was different than last year. He's like mastered being a corner three-point shooter. He wasn't that at any other point in his career. He took the role on this new team and developed into almost a new player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,I don't overlook stuff like that. I think those are forms of greatness. Even though we expect greatness to be these things that are so large or so captivating. Stuff like that doesn't go unnoticed to guys like me. It's been an honor to be his teammate.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. Team camaraderie, you're going to experience this, it's probably the hardest thing to gain in the NBA. A bunch of guys, a bunch of egos. Agents telling them one thing they feel another way. Having everybody on the same page is probably going to be the hardest thing you're going to be trying to experience throughout your career."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it always starts from the top. Like, you look at the top guys. Me and JT, we've been here the longest, and we set the tone from the jump. Everybody else kind of has to follow along. That's kind of what has worked for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Every locker room, every organization, is a little different. You got to figure out how to get your team into that same vibe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's hard enough to get two people on the same page. Trying to get 12 or 15, all the way bought in, there's going to be some challenges."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's where leadership step in. As you develop as a leader, those are the type of things that you learn. You improve, you build relationships with guys, you talk to guys on the court, off the court, they start to trust you. That's how you start to build some of those good habits."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"But it don't happen overnight, I'll tell you that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Same old, same old. KP has been tremendous for our group, not just in the Playoffs, but all season long. It's obvious him on the floor just helps elevate us to a different level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,But we've been priding ourselves on next-man-up mentality. We prepare for these moments to be able to play with or without anyone. It just requires somebody else on our team to step up and everybody to buy in to get a full team victory.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, just sprinting back, trying to make a play. Obviously they were making a little run there and whatever means necessary, just sprint back and meet him at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think my first three steps is really important. Just kind of put my head down and run. Then at that time just trust the instincts and trust the timing that I have. So, just putting my head down and sprinting just as fast as I can just to get in position and go up and make a play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"That's what Payton Pritchard does. If you watch us late clock, he doesn't shy away from that moment. That was a big-time shot, kind of got us momentum. You just love Payton. You love competing with him. It was a big-time shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"I think a lot of credit just goes to the type of people they are. They have done so much. I can't begin to talk about how thankful and grateful I am for Jrue just kind of allowing me to kind of take that next step. He could easily have came in and be, like, I'm Jrue Holiday, and I'm like, You are Jrue Holiday, a hundred percent laughing. But he kind of just did a little different than what he's done the last few years and just each game getting more comfortable. KP, the same way. Just love being teammates with both of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, the whole year the strength of this team has been one through however many guys we got. We trust whoever goes in the game and those guys just work so hard. Every time anybody checks in the game, they just give us great minutes. So we trust everybody, and everybody is making big plays for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, that's why I got dunked on earlier. But it's part of the game. I think just that not afraid to get dunked on allows me to get some that maybe some other people wouldn't have gotten. So just trying to make a play, just believing in my abilities and what I can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, that experience, that just championship DNA, which you hear all about all the time. You don't really know what it takes until you do what it takes. Just the moment he came to our team in training camp, he kind of just had that presence about him. He just knows how to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are excited to be in Boston for Game 2 of the NBA Finals and to present the 2024 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President Rick Carlisle and all of our great NBA head and assistant coaches, I would like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, Michael Levine, Tim Frank, Paul Benedict, Mark Broussard and the entire NBA for all of the league support and assistance in providing this platform to honor the extraordinary achievements of our great NBA coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"We are especially proud of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who over an outstanding career set the standard for integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion of NBA basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"Chuck was an incredible mentor to so many coaches and players in our league, including Coach Carlisle and Coach Tomjanovich."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"With that, I would like to turn it over to Coach Carlisle. Thank you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Thanks, David. Adam, thanks again. This is just such a wonderful opportunity each year to honor basketball royalty."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"I first want to thank our selection committee Bernie Bickerstaff, Billy Cunningham, Joe Dumars, Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley, Donnie Walsh and Lenny Wilkens. These eight committee members have been with us through the 16-year history of this. I think this is our 17th year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"The winners of this award over the years, it began here in 2009. The first Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award winner was Tom Heinsohn, who was the guy that originated the Coaches Association back in the early '70s, followed by Jack Ramsay, Tex Winter, Lenny Wilkens, Pat Riley, Bill Fitch, Bernie Bickerstaff, Dick Motta, K.C. Jones, Jerry Sloan, Al Attles, Hubie Brown, Frank Layden, Del Harris, Larry Brown, Mike Fratello, Rick Adelman and, of course, Rudy this year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Of all the recipients that we've had for this award, I don't think we've ever had someone whose profile was so similar to Chuck Daly's himself. Both Rudy and Chuck were back-to-back NBA championship winners. They both were Olympic gold medalist coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Interestingly, Rudy one-upped Chuck a little bit. He has a media cooperation award named after him that was established in 2011. And Rudy told me it used to be the Chuck DalyRudy Tomjanovich Award, and somehow it just shifted and now it's only Rudy. So that's pretty cool."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"But both Chuck and Rudy are guys that were beloved, unconditionally respected within the coaching profession, and guys that were able to get the very, very best out of a wide range of different kind of players and were so great and made so many people feel special and made the players that they coached feel special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"I want to recognize Sam Cassell, who is in the back. Sam was, I think, on both back-to-back teams in Houston. Hit the big shot against New York the first year, I remember that, in the Garden. He'll be coaching tonight. We tried to see if he can come out on the court for us for the award ceremony, but he's got a job to do over there so we can't pry him away. But appreciate you being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy also authored one of the great postgame comments in NBA history. I want to make sure I get this right ""Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"So it gives me great pleasure, great privilege to introduce Rudy Tomjanovich as this year's recipient of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Thank you very much. I want to thank Rick, David and the Coaches Association for this honor, the guys on that selection committee. If you had a poll of my favorite guys, all those coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,The great thing about this award is it came to me out of the blue. I had no idea I was up for this. I happened to be with my son up in Houston when I got the call and Rick started telling me about it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I got emotional. My son kept asking, ""Are you okay? Are you okay?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Then he told me what the award stood for, and finally I hung up, and I told him, ""No, everything's great."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And then I did cry. The reason is, when something like this happens, I'm not thinking about the championships. I'm not thinking about all the good stuff. I'm thinking about the dark days, the days when I doubted myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,That's pressure.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And he said, ""I promise you, I will give you everything I've got."" And he did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Now, a little bit got lost in the translation because he's really country and I'm really city. He would say some words like ""yonder"" and stuff like that. But we came up with a system for the players we had, and that's my philosophy as a coach. You don't keep the same plays every year you change it for the talent you have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And of course we had Hakeem Olajuwon. I would not be here if I did not have his cooperation and his belief. He was fantastic and a classy guy. I had great players on that team. Every time I see them -- I see Sam. I'm looking for the day that Sam Cassell is a head coach, and I want to see him cussing at players the way I cussed at him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"The other thing I want to say is I made a lot of good moves. I made some crazy moves. I traded Robert Horry twice. But I really believe he belongs in the Naismith Hall of Fame. He's proven it time and time again. He's made so many teams champions playing a role, and that's so important. It isn't about just the stats. It's about getting results. I pray that one day he's going to be able to stand up there and accept that honor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I want to thank the owners that had confidence in me to run their teams Charlie Thomas, Les Alexander and Jerry Buss. But especially the players. Then of course my assistant coaches. I still talk to my assistant coaches. We're like brothers. We still talk basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Having Carroll with me, just think about being in a high-pressure job with your older brother sitting right next to you. So that brought me a lot of comfort."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I'm just blessed to be here. Thank you, guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"If I could, I just want to mention something that happened earlier today. Rudy had a thing to go speak to NBA Entertainment. We went over to the JW Marriott and went down to this huge room, and it was really interesting to me. You see the NBA Entertainment people here and there and around the building, but there was a group of over a hundred people that were together. There were whiteboards with all kind of stuff written Stay on this guy, this could happen. It was like an unbelievable thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy spoke to these people today, and it gave, really, a unique perspective. He was fantastic."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"I also want to mention Rudy's girlfriend, Lisa Marcussen, is here as well. So thank you for being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,I know we have some questions.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"The truth behind it is it came from Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns, who said, ""The Rockets have the heart of a champion. That's why they beat us."" They had us down a couple years, and we fought back and won that series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Now, Charles Barkley had another quote. He said, ""They're like those damned Texas roaches you step on them and you think they are dead, and they scurry away."" I thought I would pick his better than, you know laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,Jim Boylen.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Yeah, we all started in the film room. I was in the film room for Bill Fitch. In fact, I have to give Bill Fitch so much credit. He worked my butt. I'm telling you, if I had a smile on my face, ""You need some more to do."" I did the video. I broke down the video. I did the scouting report. I did the walk-through and the college scouting. That's five people's jobs right there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"But it prepared me to be a solid coach. I need stuff like that. When I don't have stuff to do, my mind wanders. I get in trouble when I start thinking too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy and I both worked for Coach Fitch. Coach Fitch told me the story that he used to have Rudy, when Rudy first started as an assistant coach, in the visiting arenas, he would go to the top of the arena with a camera. Bill called it the wide angle. Bill always wanted to have the wide angle in case there was some kind of incident that happened that the TV cameras wouldn't quite get."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"If you can envision a guy who is a future Hall of Famer as a coach, and probably should be as a player as well, up at the top of ARCO Arena in Sacramento, with a small video cam, filming the game as it's going on, and Carroll Dawson was the only guy on the bench at the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,That's right.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Talk about paying your dues, pretty amazing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I remember as we pulled into Hobby Airport, which is a small airport in Houston, the fans were there at 300 in the morning. That inspiration was unbelievable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"But I stopped at the front of the plane and I said, ""Guys, if I told you all we had to do was win two home games and we would be world champions, wouldn't you think that's a heck of a good deal?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Then we played a hell of a team. Maybe the worst team for us to match up with, with New York, because they had all the big guys, and this was an era where there was a lot of rustling and bumping. Good defense was bump the guy at halfcourt, bump him at the top of the key."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So we had to come up with a strategy because at that time, we were sort of what I call a one primary scorer in Hakeem, and I relied on him so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I like being an assistant coach. I love helping people. I love the game. I cannot tell you what basketball did for me. I mean, I was from a very poor family. My parents were not educated. My father went to the second grade. My mother went to the sixth grade."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,They were so shy. I didn't even know how to sit at a table and have a meal because we only had one table and we only had two chairs. So I was so behind as far as being socially compatible with the world.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"But basketball, I started playing that game, and luckily for me, in my hometown, which is in the middle of Detroit, at our junior high, all the great players in that area would come and play there because we had an L-shaped recessed pole because you get killed playing in Detroit with a straight pole, and I got to play basketball there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"If you guys got time, I'll tell you a little bit about my other sport. I played baseball as a kid. Was an All-Star. Played against the greatest Little League player of all time. Art ""Pinky"" Deras, Hamtramck, Michigan, in 1959, went to Williamsport and won. So that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I had an uncle, my cousin who played second base, he said, ""You've got to have a game plan. You ain't going to college unless you get a scholarship. Your family doesn't have it."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,So we had a plan. Baseball was going to be it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I didn't love baseball, even though I was good at it. For some reason, I loved basketball. But in junior high, I never played one second. I got in against the teachers. I had the French teacher isolated. I shook him. I shot it. Air ball. Laughter That was my junior high career."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So when I told my uncle I was quitting baseball, he says, ""What about our plan?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""I'm going to do basketball."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He says, ""Rudy, you're an All-Star in baseball. You sit on the bench."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""I'm going to go out for the team."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So I go out for the freshman team, and a day before the cut, one of my buddies said, ""Hey, man. I'm in the coachs home room. I saw the list. You ain't on the list."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""Are you on the list?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He said, ""Yes."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I went, ""I'm better than you."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Now, the coach was an ex-University of Michigan linebacker who knew nothing about basketball. He just took the job to make some extra bucks."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So me being a shy kid, I would never approach somebody, but I wanted to play basketball so I challenged the guy, before he could announce the cut, to a one-on-one game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"At that playground, at that junior high, Detroit Pistons came there. Mel Daniels, college All-American, I played against him there. That's where I learned the game. I was so lucky. But like I said, social skills, when I think about I'm a coach and I've gone up and I get so locked up trying to give a speech."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"In fact, I think I was telling Rick, when I was in junior high, this teacher said, ""Man, you need to get out of your shell. You need to run for class president."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""Oh, no, that's not me."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I didn't know how to do a speech and all that. I go up to the microphone, I'm so nervous. I grab my fingers and crack my knuckles into the mic and everyone starts laughing. It was the most embarrassing thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I had a sadistic friend that wouldn't let them stop. He brought it the sound volume up and the roars kept going. I said, ""I'm never going to speak to anybody again."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"To think that I'm up here doing this stuff. The long road it took, that journey. But basketball was the vehicle, man. Basketball does so much. All sports do it. I just feel lucky as hell."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Pinky, we had nicknames in our city. It was a Polish city. So we had a girl who went to Wimbledon at a very young age. Her name was Peaches Bartkowicz. What was so wonderful, I'm so blessed that at our little park -- Hamtramck has one square mile, and we had a park there. We had a Hall of Fame tennis coach who taught at the courts there and then the Little League stuff and that was all volunteer coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So Pinky, he was in the Cardinal farm system. He went up there and came back and became a policeman in the suburbs. He passed away maybe five years ago. Such a humble guy. His kids never knew what a great baseball player he was."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And then Samuel, there was something about Sam. Back then, I was a head coach, but I still thought like a scout. So I did the tapes and I did Sam first. He was like the fourth-rated point guard that year from the scouting services."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I watched Sam first. I said, ""I like this guy, he's pretty damn good."" And I looked at the guys ahead of him and I said, ""No, no, no, I'm going back to Sam."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I wound up watching every game of Sam's. Then we brought him in for an interview and we just clicked. He was a basketball player. He was like the guys on that court that I played. He wasn't thinking about golf then or doing this and all that I'm a player. When he goes in the gym, he's one of the alpha guys. He's going to be in there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"We kept calling him, ""Where have you visited, where have you gone?"" Nobody even brought the guy in to interview him. I couldn't believe it. I think Robert might have been -- I can't remember which one was first, but those are my babies, and I want the best for them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I was lucky the Rockets gave me the ability to make the picks. A lot of times, you have a different department doing it and it doesn't jive. It was a perfect storm. We were a family. We worked so well together. And then bringing Clyde Drexler back in to join Hakeem, maybe the only star that we could have made that trade for in the middle of the season because they had that relationship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I would have said, ""No, I'm going to give loyalty to these guys. I'm going to let them defend their championship."" But we were so bad. We had gotten happy feet. We were losing to teams that we shouldn't, and it became available. We said, ""Let's pull the trigger."" And Clyde was phenomenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Well, you know, it's funny. I looked at the assets. I looked at the positive of players and I would get excited. It's like chemistry. What he can do what this guy can do and all that and how you put that together. I loved diagramming something that not everybody is doing and put -- maybe that guy is better going left we'll shift the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"First of all, treating people with respect, until they prove they don't deserve it. And I did. I just loved -- when I saw a player, it looked like all the things he could do was such an asset."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I think that that's why they felt -- they would say a player's coach. I don't know what a player's coach is. There is a separation. You have different roles and all that. As a young guy, I'm sure Joe Mazzulla has had to go through all that stuff, learning how to do things. Sometimes you've got to be tough."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"In fact, the year that we did decide to do the trade, I had what I called two helicopter halftimes. That's when you take your coat off and you swing it around your head and you throw it and get upset. But it doesn't happen often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,So I hope that answered it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I think that we responded really well. You know, the way their defense is set up and how much they're loading up and converging at the rim, it just puts us in positions to attack and find the easy kickout reads and just to keep the ball popping and things like that so we can get good to great shots on each and every possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, every time I'd take a couple dribbles, there was, like, three people were right there. So we got a bunch of shooters on our team and guys that can space the floor. They kept leaving Jrue open. So it wasn't like I had to do anything spectacular. It was just about finding the open guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"Good thing we don't have to find out. We're very, very fortunate to have him and he was excellent tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah. And you guys are smart enough to know the way our team is set up. Like, we have so many talented guys on both ends of the floor, that it could be a number of guys on a given night. We have a really talented team, and that's how we win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, the way they started the game, right? They were playing faster. You could tell that they wanted to shoot more threes. Neither team really shot the ball well from the three, but you could tell that that was part of their plan, just to play faster and shoot more threes and crash the glass a lot more as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, there's different ways, I guess, to phrase that. It's not all about scoring. I can be the guy rebounding and getting assists and drawing attention, right? I'm going to have the ball in certain spots, right? I draw so much attention. It's not always -- I'm not always going to be the guy to get the shot, but sometimes sacrificing, being in those spots to make the play that we get the best shot possible, knowing that what they want to take away in their schemes and things like that. So being the guy in different ways. Maybe you don't score all the points, but you do all the things that put your guys in the best position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"It has a lot to do with that I've been here before and we didn't win, and it's just like, you know, we're so close to what we're trying to accomplish, why would I let my ego or my need to score all the points gets in the way of that. There are going to be times where I need to score, and obviously, I need to shoot better. Golly. But you know, really, we always talk about do whatever it takes for however long it takes. If I need to have 16 potential assists every single night and that's what puts us in the best position to win and it doesn't mean I'm the leading scorer, by all means, if that gives us the best chance to win, sign me up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"That was a big-time play for those guys to get back. I fell on the ground, so as soon as I just turned my head and looked up, I seen that they made a play at the rim. That was big, guys making winning plays at crucial times on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I think, from a team aspect, it's just a natural process. There's a lot that goes into joining a new team, from a personal standpoint and then, you know, you've been so used to a different organization, now you come to a new team and having to learn personalities and play style and things like that. I've had a relationship with Jrue from a few years ago, we won a gold medal. So I would just, I guess, check in or always remind him, I guess, that, you know, to be yourself and, we're going to need you in big moments, obviously like tonight. Not that maybe he didn't need the reminder, but just letting him know throughout the season how much we value him and things like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Very important obviously. To go to Dallas now 2-0. Its going to be some tough games on the road, but its good we took care of business tonight and go to Dallas up 2-0."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I feel good. Feeling good. Yeah, I dont think its anything serious. But we will look at it tomorrow and go from there, but all good. Ill be good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Today I felt better. A little better conditioning. Like I said before, even though I had a really good comeback game, its tough to jump into the rhythm like that and have the conditioning and have the rhythm and have all of those things. But I think I did a decent job tonight again and helped the team win and thats it. We move forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not difficult at all. Ill die out there if we need. So just kept going. Was a little bit limited, so the smart thing was to get Al back in there and close out the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I think I have to give a shout-out to our best defensive guys like Jrue Holiday, D-White. JB has been tremendous on both ends of the floor. All three of those guys played incredible today. We just have so many weapons that its tough. But defensively, Id say, those guys and Al take us to a different level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, first it starts with our transition defense. If we don't get back and make it five-on-five, it's hard to be able to do that great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"And then the ball pressure, and then just the individual pride, taking on the pride of guarding you and then the guys off the ball, being able to do both, shift and get after shooters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Team defense, the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like we got a group of guys that really want to win. Been around a long time, and they want to do it together. When you have a locker room that has ownership and takes it upon themselves to hold each other accountable, you've got a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"The guys want to win and make that decision, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to win. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, we still do have blind spots. We're always going to have blind spots. I think it's just recognizing those and understanding how we can leverage them by using the guy next to us to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, before that, I think the play of the game can't go unnoticed, the humility of our team, is Payton's shot at the end of the quarter. You see guys around the league pass up on that shot or fake like they want to take it, so that their numbers don't get messed up. He takes pride in taking that, and that's winning basketball. So that's the first and foremost."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"That should have been the first question, is the ability of everybody on our team to do different things that lead to winning. I'm really tired of hearing about one guy or this guy or that guy and everybody trying to make it out to be anything other than Celtic basketball. Everybody that stepped on that court today made winning plays on both ends of the floor, is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"To answer your question, Jayson makes greatness look easy. He does it in a lot of different ways. He does it on defense, he does it on rebounding, he does it on passing, he does it on screening. He's a tremendous player and not hard to coach him. When he has the ability to affect the game in different ways, we're a different team. But it takes everybody to do it. That should answer everyone's question."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"The emphasis and where he's grown over the last two years is to take what the defenses give him and learn to impact the game in many different ways. Because of the type of team that we've had, especially this year, he's seen a bunch of different coverages and he's seen different matchups because teams have to match up with him. So coming into a game, it's kind of similar to a puzzle and he's done a great job learning how to solve the puzzle and do different things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Tonight, with the way that they were rotating and the way that they were defending, the most important thing was making the right play at the rim. We were able to stay out of transition because our guys made that. So I thought he did a tremendous job doing what the game called for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, you got to take a look at -- we gave up a 26-point first quarter and then three 25-point quarters. In the 26-point first quarter, we messed up the two for one and fouled a three-point shooter for three free throws. Luka gets two shooting free throws, we give up a transition basket to P.J. Washington, P.J. Washington hits an above-the-break three. That's almost 70 percent of the points there. So, like, the game was going the way we wanted it to go outside of the things that we can control. I thought our guys took the poise and remained in the mindset and the toughness to understand that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"And then Jrue, it's connected and that's what people don't realize, is like every guy on our team can't be at their best if this guy doesn't do that. So Jayson's facilitating, Jaylen's decision-making. That leads to Jrue's playmaking, and the way that they're defending us, we have to make multiple plays. We have to have multiple drives. I think Jrue did a great job -- guys did a great job finding him, he did a great job attacking closeouts and then either kicking it back out for a second drive or getting an open shot. And then what he can do defensively. It just goes back to everybody on the team works to impact the game differently every single night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,That was sick.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it just comes back to he's not defined by one thing. He's just a little bit of everything. He can handle a pick-and-roll, he can score in pick-and-roll, he can stay spaced. He's not defined by scoring. He rebounds, he plays defense, he can play pick-and-roll, ball handling, the pick-and-roll screener. He's had blocks on bigs. So he's just another guy that's selfless and wants to impact the game in any way that he can, and it looks different every night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the thing about him is the confidence that he has to maybe go some possessions or a half or -- because teams are guarding us differently, his frequency can be impacted because of that at times. But he just fights to impact the game in different ways."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, the most important thing is getting a good shot and not turning it over. So in the first half, even though miss and our points per shot was much higher than theirs, I liked every shot that we took. That's the most important thing, is take what the defense gives you, whether it's a layup or three."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"The second piece to that was our offensive rebounding. So I think we had an offensive rebounding rate in the first half of, like, 41 percent, and it died down in the second half. But when you're not shooting it well, you still want to make the right plays so that it doesn't impact the other end of the floor. But you have to have the offensive rebounding capacity to get extra possessions, and I thought we did a really good job of that in the first half and hit some timely ones in the second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, he's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"He has the humility and selflessness to not care if he misses it. He practices it and has an understanding of how a shot like that can impact the end of a quarter and it can impact the run that a team makes. So they had went on a run to end the quarter, and I thought that shot kind of gave us a little bit of poise and a little bit of momentum that we needed heading into the fourth quarter. That was big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah. Yeah. He takes pride in that, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, because you have to look at the other side of the coin. If you get away from the discipline and doing what you do in those situations, it's going lead to other things, and it goes to the trust that the guys have in each other. So as long as you're taking great shots, you have to trust the process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"On the back end of that, you got to have your offensive rebounding rate to help you. When things aren't going that way, you have to keep them off the free-throw line, which we didn't do a great job of, but we had three 25-point quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"So usually what happens is you have those empty possessions on the offensive end, your defense starts to weigh in or you start to mistrust the discipline of your spacing and your shot selection, and you end you giving transition and getting cross-matched. So the guys trusted and stayed discipline and we were able to stay out of cross-matches and we were able to kind of keep the game in the way we wanted to play it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,My interpretation? It looked like a foul. But it wasn't called. So it wasn't a foul.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, just trying to keep -- Boston is a team that can run off threes in a hurry. Just trying to keep that from happening."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Also, looking at just trying to give my guys some rest because they were fighting extremely hard. We are playing uphill, and so the lead went from 6 to 12, but then we responded after that second timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Big. The small things, you know, we have to do the small things, and that's part of the game. Those are points that we left on the board, and we didn't shoot free throws well tonight, and we have to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,He had great looks. They just didn't go down. That's just the game of basketball. Sometimes you make them. Sometimes you don't. You continue to keep playing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,He had some good looks that just didn't go down for him tonight.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he was great. No matter what he says, that's just who he is. He's a leader. It's not all on him. It's a team. We win as a team, and we lose as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"So he put us in a position. He was really good tonight. Unfortunately, we just couldn't get over the hump. I thought our defense was really, really good. We've just got to take care of the ball. There's too many turnovers that gave them points, and then also being able to -- we've got to score the ball, and right now, we've got to find someone to join Luka and Ky in that scoring category."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think Luka is a special player. He's one of, if not the best player in the world, and he causes a problem. He's able to find guys. Again, creating open opportunities, and we just didn't take advantage of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And we'll go back and look and see if we can get even better looks. But the looks that we got, we just missed some open threes. It was good to see Exum knock down an open three, and hopefully we can build on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we do have quite a few young players. And for them to have fun and enjoy this, and learn from it, and that's what they are doing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And we've counted on them all year, not just here in the Finals, but throughout the season and also in the Western Conference Finals or the playoffs with Oklahoma City or the Clippers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And for them, it's just a matter of getting comfortable and going back home. Hopefully that will help."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"We've just got to stay positive. Some of us have been in this situation before, and so just take one possession at a time, and we've got to focus on Game 3, and that's all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they haven't lost a game since May something, right? Yeah, they're hot. And not just on the road, but at home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"We've got to protect home, and that's it. We've got to find a way, continue, again, to build on our defense. Our defense put us in a position to win tonight. Unfortunately, our offense didn't help us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And so, again, Ky and Luka are going to get their looks. We have got to get someone else involved of being able to knock down some shots. Defensively, we can build on this and we can be better. We've got to take care of the ball. If we can take care of the ball, hopefully that gives us more opportunities at scoring."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, well, I think it's a matter of not just playing one-on-one but setting -- setting it up so that they can get a live ball catch and be able to work. With Luka there for a minute, he was playing below the defense, and we were able to get him on the box or at the nail, and he took full advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Just being able to move the pieces around. And I thought we did that. We've got to take care of the ball. I've said this I sound like I'm repeating myself. But if we can take care of the ball and not give them live-ball turnovers where they are not just laying up the ball or dunking, it puts us in a better seat. We've got to take care of the ball. That's the next step in the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we are not down. We're positive. This is a group that believes. We didn't get an opportunity to get a split or win two here on the road. Now Boston held serve. Now we've got to go home and hold serve."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Luka's questionable. So, we'll see how he feels when he warms up and make that decision."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,I think taking a charge or diving on the floor for a loose ball.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yes, just one game plan. If he's out, we're prepared to go without him, next man up. If he's going, the game plan doesn't change. He's in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,We've been in this seat pretty much the whole playoffs. So nothing changes.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought yesterday was a great day for us on the floor, and then also watching the game. And then I think for our group, who has been around, we tend to be loose, and I thought yesterday was a perfect example of us getting better and understanding what we have to do tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at Ky, he's a vet. He's been on this stage multiple times. But he's played the game where he wasn't effective offensively, or up to his standards, and he will take a look at what he can do better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Again, understands what he has to do tonight. Hopefully we get those same shots. We truly believe that he'll knock them down, and hopefully that puts us in a position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Maxi is doing great. He feels great. Hopefully we can find some more minutes for him tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think as a player, I mean, it's different. But as a coach, there's a lot of waiting when it's spread out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"So you've got to be able to pace the information that you're giving to guys. Don't want to overload them too early. You have to understand that with the break in between, the off-days or the days that you're not going on the court, but they are getting stimulated to still understand they have a job to do that's as a coach."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"As a player, you're just trying to figure out how to put yourself in a better position if you did lose, if you did win, you're anticipating the adjustments, what the team is going to do to try to slow you down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"So two totally different things. Again, one is -- also involves the physical activity. The other one has you standing or sitting. So definitely different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, we beat ourselves a little bit tonight just on our turnovers and just some of our defensive rotations. They got a lot of opportunities, second-chance opportunities, where they got an opportunity to go into the fast break and just create just mismatches in transition."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"Look at some of the positives for sure where we won the first and fourth. But at the end of the day, we've got to win all four quarters if we want a great chance against this team. And we have to make sure that we create enough separation where we can play comfortably, too, and freely."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So we had a good pulse about the game, I believe, going up until halftime. And then afterwards, you know, they did what other great teams do, you know, where they put their foot on the gas pedal, started pushing a little bit more, penetrating down the lane a little bit more and creating some opportunities at the free throw line. And they converted tonight, 19-for-20."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So you've got to give them credit. They definitely picked up their defensive pressure, but finally we got some great looks as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It's definitely a great test for us. They did what they had to do. They won both games at home, and now it's our job to go home and win both games at home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"You want to take advantage of playing in front of your home crowd, feeling confident and being able to play in a familiar place. And like I said, they handled what they were supposed to do, first two games, and now it's our job to go home and handle our business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"But you've got to give them credit. They kept competing. We kept competing. We've just got to stay together in some of the tough times throughout the game where it could be a four-point lead on them or four-point lead that we have. We just have to keep competing, and I think we'll be in a better place. But feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's the confidence that I have in myself. A lot of shots were hitting the back rim. That could piss you off as a competitor, but it's all part of the game of basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"And you have to accept the ups and downs of this. That's, I would say, the toughest challenge when you're in a series. You want to play extremely well, especially when you're playing in a Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It wasn't all on me, but I'm definitely taking the majority of it because my teammates look to me to convert a lot of these shots and ease the burden of not just Luka but everyone else and settle our team. We definitely made our dinner on the defensive end, but now offensively I have to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"We talked about this last series, he did something similar. But when you're in the Finals and you're taking the brunt of the accountability, he definitely -- he's in the right for wanting to single himself out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"But this is a team game. He's not alone, and we are going to tell him that. As expected, he's fresh off the court. He's spilling into his emotions, feels like he could play better, just like me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"I would take the brunt of the responsibility. The first two games weren't the best for me, especially him scoring 25-plus the points, getting rebounds, getting assists, doing the intangibles, and for me I've always felt responsible for getting other guys comfortable out there, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It's on all of us. I'm pretty sure if you hear what everybody has to say, they will say that they can do something better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"But I think the message right now is just get our bearings together. We lost by seven points. We don't want to take the total number back home and say we are proud of that. We don't want to do that. We want to go home and be prepared to win games, and in order to do that, we have to be ready to defend this good Boston Celtics team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It's just adjusting to the pace. They are playing a great style of basketball, a great brand of basketball where they are pushing in transition. Sometimes those opportunities don't come as often or as easy. They have guys backloaded. They have a lot of guys that are athletic and running back in transition."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"You saw when P.J. had an opportunity to cut it to five, you saw Derrick White contest him at the rim. You saw Derrick White over there again contesting against D-Lively, even though he got dunked on, he still came over there and contested. That's what they have been doing. They have a lot of pride on that end. And they are not going to be easy on us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So on the fastbreak component, we definitely can create more opportunities for ourselves when we are in Dallas and look forward to doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I just chalk that up to just being in Boston. You know, some of those shots, they go up in the air, and I remember last game Sam Hauser caught it in the corner, and I don't think he even brought the ball down. It was practically all net."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"They feel very confident here. They have been a great team all year. Look at their record, I don't know how many total games they have lost since the postseason started. But I don't think it's more than six or seven."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So they have really made their identity here. They want to take care of home court. And now it's our job to go home and do the same. Being in the Finals before, down 0-2, I have a little experience in this. Didn't play particularly well in the first two games in that series, too, that I'm referring to in 2016."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So now I'm just really leaning in on what I've experienced, what I've learned and some of the lessons I've been able to make sense of in how to come back in this series because it is going to be a possession-by-possession thing, and it is going to be the hardest thing that we've ever done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So I think we've got a great feel, a great experience here in Boston of what the Finals is like for our group. Now we go home and shake off the cobwebs a bit and prepare for another fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"Very, very proud of our group. We understood that we had to protect home court. We knew they were going to come out and be more aggressive. We were able to withstand their runs and protect home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I feel like we are just very connected as a group. Were just out there trying to play hard and compete and make plays. Its just unbelievable, the will of these guys in this locker room."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, he was unbelievable. His effort defensively and everything he brings on that end. And then on offense, making reads, making the game easy, making the right decisions. Hes so poised and you can tell that he has been in these types of moments. Just very composed and just out there getting the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"I thought Jayson was unbelievable. Just navigating everything, getting everybody involved, taking shots when he needed to, defensively being solid, rebounding the ball well. JT just doing it all. Were asking a lot from him and he continues to step up and answer the call for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"If I could say something before we jump in. I want to address the comment that was made yesterday. I feel like people kind of took that out of context. I've been hearing that I prefer JB over JT and that's not what that was. I like to praise my teammates. I like to praise my teammates when they're playing well, and I feel like that's what I did my best to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Again, I don't think I'm shredding the defense. I think it's moreso JT and JB. Especially tonight, JT was getting into the paint and being double-teamed and making the right plays out of it and just finding me. Just either being at the dunker spot or being in the corner. He has that vision as a playmaker, so I would give that to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Well, first, I fouled Kyrie and put him on the free-throw line and I got my third foul, so Payton came in for me. I didn't want to foul him, but I'm kind of glad that I did. The energy that Payton brings, him just having the balls to take that shot. He's done it so many times this year. Where he's had the courage to take it and he's knocked it has been huge for us. So it was definitely a confidence boost and really just boosted us for the rest of that game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think when you sacrifice together and you do something together, it brings you closer. I think being able to go through wins and losses and to build something, it means a lot. So when you go through things like that, I think it makes you closer and I think that that's what this team has done. From 1 to 15, somebody's sacrificed something. It's been great and the journey's been awesome, but at the end of the day, the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think just trying to get into space and trying to be in his vision. I know that sometimes when I drive and I might get stuck, I need somebody to drift with me or to kind of be in space and be in my vision. So I think for the most part, I just try to stay in front of him, give him a good outlet. He's been making great reads."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, when I first got traded here, he was obviously one of the first people that I talked to, and I just think his positive nature. He's kind of this kind soul, somebody who has great energy about him. So every time that I talk to him and every time I see him, he's always been encouraging. This has been from the beginning. It's always nice to have somebody like that have your back and, again, somebody like that in your corner in your organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I'm a utility guy. I'll do whatever. I'm here to win. I feel like they brought me here to win, and I'll do my best to do that. But at the end of the day, this is their team. I know it's probably just as much my team as theirs, but again, I feel like I talked about this before, the pressure that they have on themselves to execute and to be great is a little bit different than my pressure. And, again, I've always been honest about that and how they always handle themselves has been something that's been so honorable. So it's just, it's slightly different. They're superstars and I'm here to support."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, well, that one we were actually down 2-0, that was slightly different, but --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"And that's, and that's all I remember, too. So I think it's a little different that -- again, a different team, different setting, different year, definitely having COVID year, it was a bit weird. I think being on this team, the journey to this point has been, great, but we still know being up 2-0 means nothing. Job's not done. We have to do whatever it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I would say maybe I'm a bit more comfortable. Just knowing kind of the pressure and the atmosphere and obviously what's on the line, this is a bit different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, in huddles like that, it's intimate, and it's something that we kind of hold close and dear to ourselves. I think in times like that, encouraging each other, being able to police ourselves in times like that when we might be doing something that is uncharacteristic. Or even if we're doing something great, all those things are brought up in those moments to where we can really just go out there and do our best to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, I love my teammates. They have been here before. They have been here before and they know what it takes to get to this point. They have shown it. You've seen them in the Eastern Conference Finals and you've seen them in the Finals before. We're all determined as a team. We all want this and it's something that, it's collective. I won't say that I do much or I talk much. I feel like I'm more of an action type of guy. I go out there and I play as hard as I can and do whatever the team needs for us to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's natural. I think that they had chemistry and some things I had to figure out. But that just goes to show how great of teammates I have. There's been times where I've struggled kind of figuring out my place or what I need to do to help the team win, and Derrick has been the person who has talked me through it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I've been point guards on other teams and I've been shooting guards on other teams. But Derrick is our point guard, and he's shown that the whole season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,I would say that there are different times in the season where each guy's kind of come and talked to me about how they felt and how they saw the game and what I could do to help and all that. That's helped me out tremendously getting to this point.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,Stay consistent on defense. Our communication is always tested when it comes to games like this because of how much they want to play on the perimeter. We have to make sure we get those guys inside the line and make sure our rotations are top-tier.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just got to play to the physicality. At the end of the day, you know, they are pushing us around. We've got to be able to do the same thing. That's kind of like what the message was when we came out the second half Set the tone physically."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Having poise offensively and making sure we get the right guys downhill. Well, pretty much any guy downhill to be honest with you. We've got a lot of guys that can drive to the basket and score the ball that gravitate a lot of attention from anybody that's the low man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"So we just have to make sure as bigs, me and D-Lively, make sure we get the guys downhill to where they can get a shot off, or we get a rebound if they miss it, or just throw the lob over the top."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure we are focusing on the positive things at the end of the day. I know Luka said it was a lot on him when it came down to it. It's a team it's a team game. You know we can't have one person taking the blame for everything because you know we all have faults in certain areas on the floor and we make up for that trying to just really continuing to play through this as adversity, any obstacle that we face, we always have to play through that as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"So he missed free throws I missed free throws. There's a lot of guys that missed free throws tonight, and that hurt us. So it's not just on him. Not on Kyrie. It's a team thing, and we just have to come out with the same mindset that we had tonight and try to win all four quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, this is the biggest stage in the NBA. Everybody wants to be here at the end of the season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"So we just have to come prepared, shake off the nerves, get the butterflies out. It's going to be crazy atmosphere, crazy energy. It's the NBA Finals. Everybody wants to be in this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,For sure. They got their crowd into it when we came here and they did their job when it came to protecting home court and we have to do the same thing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just focus on the positives. At the end of the day, we just find ways to just make adjustments to what we kind of lacked in certain areas, most definitely. Watch film, learn from it and be ready for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"No, I don't think so. I feel like they just made plays at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Our poise. Be comfortable in the situation. Embrace the atmosphere and really embrace whatever's going to be thrown at us. This is a great team that we are playing against, and they are going to throw everything they can at us to just rattle us in any given circumstance. So we just have to take our time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, I actually was -- you know, I always want to play. So all day we did a lot of things to get ready for the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,Good. Good. I was okay.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"I'm sorry, I don't know who is the Celtics owner."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Every game we lose, it's a missed opportunity for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, obviously didn't work because we lost. But at the end of the day, we've got to make some more shots. I think my turnovers and my missed free throws cost us the game. So I've got to do way better in those two categories."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"But at the end of the day, we've got to make shots to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,That's why they are the No. 1 team in the NBA with the No. 1 record. They have a lot of great players. Basically anybody can get off.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Honestly, I think we didn't do a bad job defending today. We took away threes. We contested more threes. And like I say, I had too many turnovers, and we missed a lot of free throws. So I think that cost us the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they are physical, yeah. But they try to guard one-on-one. I think today they tried to help more. I was able to get some teammates open. But they are physical. They are very physical. We let them be physical. So they are pretty, pretty amazing on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,I think it was a charge. We don't really know because I didn't feel it until the next day. I was really surprised. So we think it was a charge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,We've got to make shots. We've got to make free throws and less turnovers. Those three things I think are the key for a win -- to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Score more points. But at the end of the day, it's basketball, away or home. We've just got to play better basketball to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Sorry, I don't understand you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Yes -- I don't really know how to respond, but yes. I'm sorry."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was great. In moments where we gained some momentum, that helped us get over the hump. So tonight we came out, we didn't shoot the ball well. We were a little flat, but I felt like the crowd helped us stay in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue has been an example of just excellence. Since he's been here, his role has been different from what it was the last few years on Milwaukee, and he's been able to adapt. Not a lot of guys can do that, be versatile, play different roles and different styles and still have an effect on the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue, he just came in, he wasn't on the ball as much, still guarded at a high level, but became a corner three-point specialist. That's just a testament to his greatness. Tonight they wanted to emphasize loading up, making us make the right reads over and over again, and Jrue had a lot of opportunities tonight and he took advantage. He's just a hell of a player, hell of a person, great teammate. I credit the victory to him tonight. He played well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, we got a lot of weapons on our team, so we just got to trust what we've been doing all season long, trust our game plan. We didn't hit shots tonight. I thought we had a bunch of great looks. If you go back and look in the first half, Sam had a bunch of great looks, D-White had some look that didn't go down. But we didn't panic. We kept guarding, we stayed in the game and we kept trusting it and we made enough tonight to win the game. But we expect to shoot the ball better going forward when we get on the road."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Derrick is -- he's been, you know, All-Defensive all season long. In that moment right there, we make a tough rim read. Rim reads lead to transition, so we want to manage that a little bit better. But it's the playoffs, you got to just get back and make a play. Derrick White sprints back. I see they have an advantage. I sprint back and was able to make a play there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"But those are the type of plays that help you win games. It's just effort, that's what it comes down to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue is a great teammate, nothing short of that. He's brought championship pedigree to our team. So nothing Jrue says we question. Jrue, he comes in and he just is who he is. He's got that demeanor, that killer-like mentality, and we respect it. You know what I mean? He's a great teammate and it's just an honor to play next to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"But it's just an example of what we do and have been doing all season long. How you finish quarters is big. We didn't finish that quarter great. We got a lot of open looks, we gave up some. There was some bad fouls. One of them was mine. I fouled Luka on the back cut, and then me and JT got mixed communication on the switch. Luka had a three."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,We got to finish quarters better. But Payton checks himself in the game and covers us a little bit by hitting the big-time shot.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. That's the majority of what the battle is, just managing your emotions. How do you handle adversity and your will and your perseverance. Everything isn't going to go according to plan. I wouldn't have hoped that we shot, I don't even know, what, 7-23 from three? We had a few ill-advised turnovers and fouls, but effort makes up the difference."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Your mindset, we play -- I think we played harder than them tonight, and I think that's just going to be the key. If we want to win, we just got to be the harder-playing team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. Just trying to wear on those guys, be as physical as we possibly can, full team effort. Just keep touching them. That's it. I think that those guys are tremendously gifted offensively. They came out swinging. Luka came out in the first quarter, we knew what he was going to do. We knew he was going to be aggressive. But we just stayed with the game plan. We stayed just consistent and we was able to turn him over a few times that helped us push the lead out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, that's just being patient. You got a lot of energy, excitedness, nerves, when the game starts, but sometimes you just got to be patient. And I got to the paint pretty much whenever I wanted, and I could be patient when I get there. I had a few turnovers where I had a little bit more time to wait for the defender to make a choice, because those two-on-one reads are there, where you get to the paint, the defender is, the big is coming, you either kick it to the corner or if he drives down to the corner you kick it to the wing. But don't got to be in a rush. Just protect the ball, make the great decisions and trust your teammates. I think that's what the majority of this is. We did that enough tonight, but I think we need to do it a little more going into Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"We expect them to play better. They have showed that all postseason. I think they have lost Game 1 a couple times, and they came back with a big Game 2 win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,So we expect them to play a lot better. We've got to be even better than we were last game and just try to clean up the things we made mistakes on and understand it's definitely going to be a bigger challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,I feel like always the No. 1 adjustment is to play harder. Play with more physicality. We can't be satisfied. We've got to understand that. We've been talking about that the whole postseason. It's just physicality. So we've got to be ready for whatever they throw at us.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"Each game just gets more and more difficult. The more comfortable you get with the team, the more you know what they like to do, what we like to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"Each game just gets more and more difficult. Each game is a different adjustment, and you've just got to figure out what they change and how we can attack that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it feels way different. I think anytime you make it for the first time, this is just like a dream come true. And it's just a lot going on, obviously. So this year, I'm not surprised by it, just comfortable and ready to compete."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"I think any experience is great to have. Obviously, it was a different series, different time, different team. But all experience is nice. We've learned a lot from that. I think we've grown from it. Whatever it takes to win, and whatever it takes to advance, that's what we've been doing this whole postseason. So whatever it takes. We win, we lose, but we got to be ready to compete at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"First things first, you've got to compete. Just try to make them uncomfortable. Obviously, two great players. They kind of play a little differently, but two great players. Just try to keep them in front and try to have them take tough shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"I love Joe. Love playing for him. He's a great basketball mind. The way he thinks is next level. I think this year he's just much more comfortable, and we all feel comfortable with him as our coach. It's been great just learning from him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I give Drew a lot of credit for my development in helping me get to where I'm at. I started working with Drew when I was in eighth grade and every offseason since then, we've worked out together. That's like family. I've said it a million times that, you know, Drew is a big reason in helping me get to where I'm at, and you know, I'm very thankful for everybody that played a part in helping me, you know, reach my goal and continue to strive in this space that I'm in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"That, you know, far from over, it's an extremely long series and not get too excited or get too down about a win or a loss. Don't feel like that the series is over and that we had it won because of the last game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"And if you lose a game, right, we talk about it all the time that it's going to take however long it takes. If that's four, five, six, seven, whatever, we are trying to just take it one game at a time and not skip any steps, whatever we've got to do to win. That's what we have to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"It's just about reading the game. Draw so much attention, you know, when I have the ball in my hands, and you know, it's about creating an advantage. We always talk about that, watching film, creating advantage, finding the mismatch that we want, and it might not always end up in the shot for you. Or if you set a screen and get a smaller guy on you, just having that mismatch and calling for the ball, right, it may draw other defenders to help, and we can pin in for somebody else to get a shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, those things won't show up in the stats sheet, but it's part of our execution, and sometimes you have to make a sacrificial cut or things like that to generate good shoots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I mean, it's a lot that goes into that, right. Time of the game. Time to score. Who is in the game with me. All those things play a part."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"A lot of times, if you can generate shots for other people and make the defense have to respect those guys, it eventually opens a lot of other things up for you later in the game that you can take advantage of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"No reaction. This is a team sport, right. We understand that. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have JB on our team, and we can say that for a lot of guys, right. We have all played a part in getting to where we're at, and we understand that people try to drive a wedge between us. I guess it's a smart thing to do or try to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,We've been in this position for many of years of guys trying to divide us and say that one of us should be traded or one is better than the other. So it's not our first time at rodeo.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"They really just kind of test your discipline. They test, are you going to make the right play over and over and over again. Even if it's not resulting in you getting the shots or you scoring all the points."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"But you know, you're constantly scoring at a high rate. We are up 20 at halftime. They are trying to test if human nature is going to play a part of wanting to get yourself going. Instead of doing all the things that is making the game easier for the team, you know, you just have to stay committed to doing what's right and making the right play until they adjust their defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,Whoevers open. Laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we understand that. I feel like we're going to get -- I don't want to say their best shot, but you know, we understand that they are going to play a lot better, and we have to be prepared for that. Not let it catch us off guard or, you know, wait till the second quarter if we are down to lock in. Understanding from the jump that they are going to come out and play faster. They are going to shoot more threes. They are going to play harder."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"So I think knowing that coming into the game is the first step. And then, you know, focusing on what we need to do. There's a lot of things that we watch in film that honestly we feel like we could be a lot better at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"All in all, we feel like tomorrow should be really fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we've had conversations about it before. In all reality, we've just had to deal with it for a very long time. I think it's part of us maturing as men, right. Very, very young coming into this league, and just had to deal with all the ups and downs of, essentially, the success that we've had. There's been positive things and there's been negative things that come with that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"We are not the first duo to go through that process, and we won't be the last. So understanding that side of it, and just keeping the main thing the main thing, and focusing on the job that we have front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"I think, like I said, just over time, you learn how to deal with things. There was a point, right, in my career where things did affect me or would bother me that, you know, to hear people talk about me on TV."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"But you just have to come to a realization that, for one, don't take it personal. People have a job to do. You have to respect that. They have to go on TV and give their analysis of, you know, things that they see and watch, and that's fair. You understand what the media side has done for the game of basketball and how we have all benefited from that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Again, people wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't one of the best players. I'm not the only player that they have ever talked about, and I won't be the last. So understanding that side of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I was in my hometown of West Linn. I believe I was in West Linn. Maybe I was in Oregon City. But, yeah, I was back home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just remember KG, after he won, doing the interview after where he was shouting out to his kids and stuff like that, going crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"In 2008, I was 10."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Playing sports, baseball, basketball, running around. Big into sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Not until high school. It's when I transitioned to just hoop.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Always basketball. I liked it all equally. Baseball and football.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They said that? I don't know if I'm superstitious. Maybe I'm like superstitious like if I have a bad shooting game, I probably won't wear those shoes again. That's about it. Like something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,This feels similar. We've been through it before. So we're used to a lot of things coming. So we know we've got to be ready for Game 2 and try to take care of business.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player so you have to be prepared for a lot of things. You have to play hard, make things tough and hope he misses."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He draws so much attention. So even if he's not shooting the ball well, he can draw a lot of attention. Defenses are collapsing on him. Creates easy shots for teammates even when he doesn't have the ball. He's very impactful, always."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's really relaxed. Quiet. A little bit reserved. Great dude. Easy to be around. Yeah, he's just easygoing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's hard for me to say because I know him. So I know he's one of the best players. But like the way his personality is, he's just laid back. So he's not, like, showboating and acting like he's the best. He's confident but -- I think he's confident knowing who he is so he doesn't feel the need to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I feel pretty good. Yeah. Feel good. Not much more to add. Preparing my body for tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Obviously as I said postgame, it was like a relief, being back on the court, healthy, winning games, starting off the series the right way. It was definitely a relief. But yeah, it's like a lot more work to be done and yeah, tomorrow we get another chance on our home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's huge. It's huge, obviously. But yeah, to be honest, the way I moved, looking back now at the game, and I dont think I even expected myself to be able to be moving so well. That was, again, a good sign for myself and now having two days in between and preparing my body again, getting even probably better conditioning now for next game will be huge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, good, like, how do you say, description of a little bit, especially preparing myself all regular season for the playoffs and round one, something unfortunate happens and staying mentally put and staying in the right place to have the chance to come back later in the playoffs and of course I wanted to come back earlier but it didn't work out that way. But here I am now and healthy and able to put on a good game for my first game back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It was insane. I'm not going to lie. Just walking in the tunnel was like a WWE style walk-in. I didn't even know it was for me at first walking out, hearing that crowd roar and getting real excitement to start the game and give everything to these fans that came."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,We were joking in the back that I should do that next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think that goes unnoticed a lot of times and what goes unnoticed is he doesn't get the credit a lot of times and he's the first one to get all the blame if he doesn't have a monster game. It's a little bit unfair to him. But hats off to him for taking it on the chin and conducting himself as a champion and being like, I'll do whatever it takes for this team to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Of course, he's always the focal point for the other team and JB and then maybe, I don't know, I'm third, fourth, fifth, sixth on the list. That takes a lot of pressure off me. I can have a lot more open looks, a lot more, like, good situations for me. That's credit to JB and JT but especially JT."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"The balance is having proper spacing. Making the right play. I thought we did a good job of fighting for our spacing, making the right two-on-one reads. That's more important than anything else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so I think regardless of who we are trying to attack, making sure we are at the proper spacing and making sure we are making the right play based on where the two-on-one read is is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great person. He's a great coach. Just humility, joy, work ethic, intensity that he brings. And, you know, we've grown to have a great relationship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I'm very grateful for him, and I'd like to think that we make each other better. So it's great that he was here. It's great that he was able to share some of his wisdom and got to spend time with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, when I talked with him in the process of deciding if he wanted to come here, I said the thing about our team is we need everybody and we are going to play guys. You don't get to where we are at right now and win a lot of games unless you have great depth."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"And throughout the season, because it's such a long season, what those guys do kind of gets lost in the shuffle. But there was moments where he helped win us games, second night, back-to-back, four in five, whatever it is, NeeNee Neemias Queta and those guys starting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So their ability to just stay locked in and stay professional and impact winning is very important, and so that was what I told him before he came here, and him, the other guys and the player development staff do a great job of just staying on top of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just need to focus on the truth. At the end of the day, nobody knows because they are not in the locker room. And so I think as long as we focus on the truth, we focus on the things that we talk about every day, we focus on the relationships that we build with each other, we focus on just that stuff."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"They can look at it however they want. At the end of the day, what goes on in our locker room, how we communicate with each other, how we build relationships with each other and how we treat each other on and off the floor, that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,I wonder how many of those have been Christian coaches.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, spacing is, like, ages old. It's the most important thing. I think you've seen different spacings based on how the game has changed and how the game has evolved and how your roster evolves and how -- I think the better offenses have gotten, the more creative defenses have gotten, and the ability to put guys in certain spots, protecting the rim, where are your best individual defenders."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So being valuable in your spacing I think is the most important thing because you have an understanding of who is where, and you have an understanding of where the advantages are. And so it's one of those things that you have to fight for. It's a simple detail that, if you don't talk about a lot, it can get overlooked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"But your spacing can manipulate the type of shots that you get and the decisions that you make, and I think that's the fight. Dallas's defense, they are one of the smartest, best defensive teams in the league, and they have the ability to manipulate your spacing with their rotations and with their personnel, and so we've got to be just as creative and just as disciplined in our spacing to make sure that we can counteract that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's kind of what Pep has helped me with, spacing. Very important in transitions how you move those guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think as you get into this, you start to realize, once you're in a position, nobody can really relate to you other than people in those positions. So you develop a bond with other coaches and you know what they are going through and you know what the challenges are and the opportunities and the situation you're in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think it's really important that we all stick together, me, him, Coach Jim Montgomery, Alex Cora. You just have to stick together and help each other through it because each of our four coaches have been through it, whether it's inside Boston or outside Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Jerod and I got close as assistants, just how would you do things when it's your opportunity, what have you learned from the head coaches that you've worked for. And now that we are in this position, it's helping each other with the transition and the different experiences."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"The most important thing for guys like Sam and Payton is having an understanding we would not be here without those guys. They have literally won games for us. And you're not defined by scoring. That's one of the strengths of this team top to bottom, whether it's the starters, role guys, not one guy strives to be defined by one thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So getting two stops on defense, being in the right spot, getting two rebounds, getting to the free throw line, sprinting to manipulate the spacing to get an open shot. All those things count for the same, especially at this time of year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"And Sam has done a great job in his career of not being defined as a shooter, of being able to do other things. And our team has taken that on, and we have to work to stay to be that well-rounded on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just making sure we make them uncomfortable from the jump. I feel like Game 1 we eased into the game when we shouldn't have. We should have came out and threw the first punch instead of taking the first punch. They are a great-shooting team, and we just have to be able to get them off their spots and force them into our defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY,"Adapt. Learn. As I said before, if we are the same person we were yesterday, then we aren't getting better. Everybody here wants to the right thing and everything we can possibly do to win. That's what everybody on the team needs to do so we can get a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's playing our game of basketball and not going into the game that they want us to play. Playing our game of pick-and-roll. Getting out in pace, getting in space and making them overhelp so we can get open shots and we can get people open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like it's definitely big plays, whether it's a dunk or three ball. As long as our team is together, we are cheering, yelling, connected, it definitely makes other teams question what they are going to do or question their schemes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"Our footwork. Our placing of knowing where our positioning is on the defensive side, no matter if it's setting them down, us being low, not being late on coverages and calling out coverages early so they can't get easy pick-and-pop threes. It's been a lot of fail and learn, fail and get a little bit better. We are not going to get better at all if we don't learn from our mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"We have to get up into them. We can't let him just post up, get the ball at the top of the key and just lace it down because he is going to shoot over the top. It's going to be trying to make sure that we get him off of his stops. Get him one or two feet away from his normal spots so he's a little more uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"All he says is keep your head down and stick to the grind. There's not a lot of things he can do all the way back in Dallas. All he's telling me to do is the little things, whether that's hitting them on the box-out or being able to talk to my teammates on the back side. Just doing the little things so that everybody is connected on the court so that we are not leaving everybody behind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"For sure. I feel like everybody in the first half, everybody is thinking, they can shoot, they can shoot. Whenever we can come out and show that we can defend, we can get them off the three-point line, then it's a different game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY,I feel like it's not panic. It's more urgency of getting the job done.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I think we've just got to overall be on a better page together, offense and defense. We gave up way too many rhythm threes for them. They have a very capable three-shooting team. On the offensive side, just finding our spots better, creating the space for Ky and Luka to operate and make the right plays. Overall, finding our spots, communication and play better together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,We believe in each other. We just try to play hard. We saw the mistakes. We watched the tape. So we just have to make the right adjustment and come out with the right energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,We have got to make it a little bit harder on him to get the catches on the elbow. Push out a little bit further and then just stay in front of him and make sure we contest a shot the best way possible. We definitely can't let him get into rhythm early.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I think we dealt with good crowds in Game 1s before. I feel like OKC and Minnesota were very loud, too. Obviously, this is the Finals and it's the biggest stage. But at the end of the day, we have to focus on our game and play with the right mindset."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I wouldn't say it's a big change for us. We just have to, like I said, focus and do a better job on what we're supposed to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"Of course. We have been together for so long now. We had some trades at the trade deadline. But it gives you time to just spend more time together, play more together. The deeper you get into the playoffs, the bond is growing. Even yesterday in the meeting, just the way we communicated and figure out solutions for the problems, it's just showing that we can grow every day as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I think there's a big, big gap between Dirk Nowitzki and me. He's one of the greatest ever, so I would never, ever dare to compare myself to him. I also think the role that he had and the playoff run that they had back then was so outstanding and one of the most underrated runs -- not underrated but crazy underdog runs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"For me, it's an honor to be here, to fight with the team for the championship. I don't take it for granted. Just come out here and play my hardest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought we were too much one-on-one. We've got to move bodies. We've got to move the ball. Multiple guys have to touch the ball. We were just too stagnant, and that's not the way we play. We've got to be better tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Unfortunately, we are not playing. I don't know how to answer that question. I'm taller. I would post him up, but he would probably be more physical."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,He's one of the best coaches in this league. He's gotten his team to the Finals. They play at a high rate. He understands his group.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"So when you talk about Joe, he's done an incredible job. And it's not easy, especially when you're favored or supposed to be somewhere. It puts a little bit more pressure. But I think he's handled it well. His group plays at a high level. His group plays hard. He's one of the best coaches in the league. For that, we have our work cut out as a coaching staff. We've got to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"He got great looks. Unfortunately, our two quarterbacks had turnovers that normally don't happen. Give credit to Boston. But we believe that the shots that he got in Game 1 were great looks that just didn't go down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,I think there's no panic with this group. We didn't play well in Game 1. Give credit to Boston they did.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But it's a series and we don't just look to capitalize on just one game. We've lost Game 1 a lot of times, and we've responded. We believe that we can respond in Game 2. We just try to take it one game at a time. We didn't have a really good first quarter there at the end. Put us down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,But the guys kept fighting. We found a way to get it to eight. It was very similar to the way the playoffs started for us with the Clippers. We didn't play well. We cut that 30-point lead down and made a game of it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,But we responded in Game 2 on the road. Hopefully we can do the same thing here in Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Jayson, he's one of the best offensive players in this league. Understanding that he puts a lot of pressure behind the three, behind the line, and then also being able to get to the rim. He's not one that just settles."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"We have to, again, try to keep him from getting to the rim, keeping him off the free throw and then giving him wide-open threes. And so that's not easy. It's easier said than done. Again, we just have to make it tough on him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"On the defensive end, he uses his length. He's strong. He's not one to give in. We've got to find other ways to score."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we knew that he was going to play, and he played well. He played well coming off the bench. He's played well starting, or as he showed, coming off the bench."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"We've got to make it tougher on him. When he starts to get going, he can shoot it from halfcourt with range. We have to be able to take some of those threes away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"On the other end, we have to make him work. But we also got to account for -- when you go to the basket, he's going to be there. You have to account that he's got a good chance of blocking the shots. We have to take advantage of his overhelp at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we happened to play the same position, some are a little bit better than others."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But when you look at the things this we have to do just in this series better, we've got to take care of the ball, we've got to make it easier for Ky and Luka. Being able to put those guys in different spots on the floor so there's a little bit stress-free so they can do what they do at a high level. We just didn't do that in Game 1."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But it's really simple conversation when you talk about things that we have to do not just on the offensive end but the defensive end. Ky and Luka take responsibility for that. Our conversations are really simple and to the point. When you talk about the high IQ, you don't have to sit there and paint the picture. You can just get right to it. They understand from my side what I'm asking them to do, and when they respond I understand what their responses are and what they are talking about and what they see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"It's worked at an extremely high level for when we do talk in-game or on a day like today of what we are trying to get to. Those guys trust what I see or what I'm telling them, and I trust their response."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"I think just understanding this group, it's not about screaming or yelling. It's about what we do best, and when we are having fun and smiling is when we are at our best. I just felt there at the end of the first, we just weren't at our best. It was talked about and it's going to happen. It might happen in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But the response from our group has to be quicker and it has to be better. Not where we're talking about we have to score the ball, but we have to get better on the defensive end, and that's being connected. We felt we lost a little connection there at the end of the first. But when we talked about it at halftime, it was a great response and we did play at a better level in that second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we'll make some adjustments. But Boston is going to give the layup to Luka, so he's got to take it. They're not going to give him the lob, and they are not going to give the corner three. So it's two-on-two, and we have to take advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"We missed some layups. We missed some shots in the paint. That happens. But we believe that Ky and Luka will get into the paint and make them in Game 2. But it's no different than what we saw in Minnesota. Just understanding that Boston is a really good defense, and being able to bluff or take away something, we trust that Luka and Ky will pivot and do what's best, and that's take the layup or take the easy two and continue to wear out the paint and layups."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But we've got to make those, too. Because on the other end if you don't make them and they come down and they make a couple threes, it puts a lot of pressure on your offense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Well, Jaylen is their best player. Just looking at what he does defensively, he picked up Luka full court. He got to the free throw line. He did everything, and that's what your best player does. Just understanding he plays both sides, defense and offense, at a high rate. And he's been doing that the whole playoffs. I mean, when talk about the Eastern Conference MVP, and it seems like he has continued to pick up where he left off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"So he's playing at a high rate. We've just got to be a little more physical with him. And again, we have to keep him off the free throw line and out of the paint because, again, he was finishing at a high rate or he was getting fouled and getting to the free throw line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time. It's not the first time we've heard that Dallas fans are panicking. Shout-out to our fans. We appreciate your support all year. Just stay poised, man. Stay focused on the goal. This mission is bigger than us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"By doing your best not to pay attention to it because a lot of people don't know what they are talking about, and specifically if you've never played that position or been on a team at that level where you have to go through it yourself, and I know that we have people that appreciate the game of basketball that speak on it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm just here to play basketball. It's a dream come true to be at this level. I've had to work extremely hard. I've been a winner my whole entire life. I've obviously had some failures and loss but done a lot more winning. Used to it. In order to be on that type of frequency or that goal, you've got to be selfless in your approach."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously you're not going to get it right all the time, but as a teammate, you just want to push those other things to the side that don't really matter or get you better as a team. So we just leave it to everybody else to argue whose team it is and who has the most responsibility. It's all our jobs to be prepared. S----y conversation, but it has to happen in sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,Just by paying attention to how we prepare and also just adjustments. Sticking to the game plan.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,I mean it was our first time being together as a group in this Finals stage. Experience is the best teacher at times when you don't know what to expect.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Going out there, TD Garden, playing against the Boston Celtics, who are having a historic season. We knew they were going to come out with a lot of verve, a lot of energy. And they have been doing it all year. They have been consistent on their end. I think it's pretty easy to say we can focus on our end and pay attention to what we can control."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But it's a little bit deeper than that. Just got to calm our nerves, poise our nerves a little bit and just be aware of the environment we are in. It's going to be high intense from who we are going against. It's going to be very physical. Some things are going to be called and some things aren't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"I think we got all that experience in Game 1, and we are looking forward to the challenge in Game 2 to play better and being who we have been since post-All-Star Break and just having fun in doing it. This is the highest level of basketball right now. We are the only two teams playing. We are proud of ourselves but we are not satisfied. We've just got to continue to be ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"He was reiterating the same things I'm saying, probably a little bit more simple. But he's been giving us a lot of peace of mind, especially when we are out there, high-intense environment, like I said. Just got to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"By realizing that I've been in this league for 13 years, and I've been playing against the Celtics for quite a few years and I have quite a few playoff series against them, whether wins or losses."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So I just try to be aware that this is a new space that I'm in as one of the leaders of the team and with the new group, and giving them that peace of mind, like I said, when things get tough. We are going against a very historic team in the Boston Celtics, but we're a great team too. We have to remember that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"And engaging with fans here in Boston is always fun. Like I said last week, it's something I'll turn the page over on, too, but people continue to ask me about it and what I think about it, which is cool, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But yeah, this is what makes sports fun. This is what makes the stories fun. Getting a chance to go against a giant like this, whether it be just talking about the team or talking about the environment and the fans and how crazy it can get. This is what I imagine it being like, getting to this stage again, earning our way to be here with my teammates and being able to put our best foot forward going against the best of the best. That's everything you dream of. Everything else is extracurricular."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"No. Not really. Again, I've been able to grow over the past few years to put basketball in perspective. This is an incredible experience that I get to live out for quite a few years of my life. I'm going to learn a lot of lessons that I'm going to apply to life after this. I failed miserably while also not knowing how to compartmentalize or accept the emotions that come with failure, and also being on the successful side, didn't know how to handle that either."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So the past few years have been about that growth perspective for me and learning how to handle myself in situations and circumstances that are going to be more beneficial for me to learn now than learning it when I'm 38 years old, and I'm looking back at my career, and I don't even know how to celebrate that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't expect to be celebrated by everybody. I'm going to, you know, still be aware that a lot of people want to see me fail. But again, I think I pay attention more to the way that I'm celebrated from people that love me unconditionally and I go home and have a peace of mind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"You know, thinking about my time in Boston, I could go down a myriad of things that none of you in here know that I was dealing with, and I don't think a lot of people would care. I think a few people would care and want to hear about it, and I would leave that space open in the future if you ever want to hear about it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But putting into perspective the blowup dolls and remarks that are getting said, that's basketball. When I leave out of here and I walk around Boston, I don't hear a lot of the things that I hear when I'm playing on the court. There's a lot of mutual respect. There's a lot of eye-to-eye communication that's built on just being human, and they appreciate the things I do off the floor, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So there are a lot of Celtics fans out there that still love me, too, surprising to everybody. But when I'm on the street walking around, which I do, you know, it's a lot of love. I get a lot of embrace. I take pictures. My dad is here, he played at Boston University. So there has to be a respect there because if anything happens to my family while I'm here, then it goes way beyond the game, you know."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,And I don't forget things either. Somebody threw something at me while I was here. I've heard it all. Nobody asked me how I felt after that and why it could be a little bit of a traumatic response when I'm back in this environment after somebody does something like that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"You know, so things have changed since then. I've been able to accept what I cannot change but also change the way that I look at things to be more positive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So this is fun for me, man. This is healthy. I'm glad that I can be up here on this stage speaking authentically and then also go home and be at peace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, teaching is fun. Being a student is even more fun. So when you're in a film session with J-Kidd or Coach Sean Sweeney or even Luka, myself, and the rest of our guys, there's a lot of honest communication going on. Just what we see. And we always make sure that we are aware that -- we're a new group in this environment, too. So give ourselves some grace and patience and be ready to play our best game every day and prepare."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"The things we see out there, we have to talk about it. Some of the cues that you would normally have when you make it to this level, we are still developing, and that's okay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So as we look to become an even better team, a greater team through this experience, this is what's needed is just that honest communication."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would start off with this. So, try not to get FOMO as best you can just because you're so used to playing every single day, working out every single day towards a goal, and now that that goal isn't necessarily there to win the Championship, you have to set other goals, and that comes from a personal standpoint. You know, what do you want to accomplish bringing into next season, it starts now while no one is watching and while it's just you by yourself or your brother or you're playing five-on-five."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,Just working on the things that everyone said that you were not great at or you could not do or that you see within yourself that you need to improve.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Because you're seeing how hard it is to get here and how long you have to stay locked in, as you said. So I've been able to find some peace of mind throughout this journey, throughout this year, of just making this phrase, like our team bonding thing, like just peaking at the right time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Some teams peak really early, some teams peak in the middle of the season, and some teams start peaking at the end. Some teams get into the playoffs or get deep into the playoffs and they peak."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"It just depends where you are as a team and your understanding of what you're doing, and also appreciating all the hard work it took to get here. A lot of our peers are watching and trying to get back to where we are, get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So we have to be aware that the hunger is going to be more next year, but we are also going to be hungry, too, to show why we are one of the best in the world. Two teams left. Dream come true as a kid to be in a Final, see the court change a little bit, see all the stickers, see the 600 media members and credentials we get. It can be a lot, but it's also something you want to appreciate because you never know when you're going to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Take your time, but also work your tail off right now because I know I'm going to have to get ready for you guys next season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"They're definitely a team that is going to come out swinging, much, much more aggressive. For us, to be able to come out with the same energy and continue to play at a high level like we've been doing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"Every series is different. Every game is different. For us, we understand it's a big challenge. We are not really thinking about the past. We have to focus on this Game 2 and make sure we do the things we need to do to put ourselves in position to win a game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"It presents its own challenges. And now obviously I know that they are going to come out very aggressive, and we are, as well. It's just one of those things that we have to make sure that we just stay the course. Emotions are obviously going to be high. From Game 1 to Game 2, the biggest thing is making sure we are as prepared as we can be and ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"DJ has been great for us. Very clear with his concepts what he wants to do. Creating how he wants us to execute things. I feel like our group, obviously weve bought in, were really locked in and trying to do the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"J-Kidd, man, I see what he is doing. I see what he is doing. Jaylen Brown is an unbelievable player and very special for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think we came out aggressive, which was good. Gave us some leeway to withstand their punch when they came back. I think we did a pretty good job executing for most of the game but keeping our poise, even being up almost 30 and then coming down, cutting it to eight. I think we kept our poise pretty well and pushed it back up to 20."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Something different. They are probably going to try to get more threes. I think their role players are going to make more of an impact, and then they are just going to come out more aggressive. It was Game 1. Its always a feeler game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think when both teams get more comfortable out here, it will be a battle."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's Game 2 of the Finals. I think we are definitely expecting them to swing and come out clawing and fighting. We know in their Game 2s, Luka has started off, definitely been killer, especially, in the first quarter. I think at this point we have to lock into the game plan and do the best we can to kind of withstand their punches and go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we did the best we could trying to take away their lobs. Those are definitely energy plays for them. Two high flyers in Gafford and Lively, we tried to take those away. I think we tried to keep them on the free throw line as best possible, and we know they have corner shooters in Derrick Jones Jr. and P.J. Washington and Tim Hardaway Jr. They have a lot of great role players out there. So just really going to do the best we can to try to minimize it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think the relationship between Jayson and Jaylen is natural. I don't think that they try to force anything upon one another. I feel like people do try to make it like a big deal, but honestly, who they are, they can be quiet at times, but when they speak, everything that they say is important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,And I think that their relationship is their relationship and it's been awesome.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I like it a lot better being on their side rather than -- rather than going against them just because I've been in situations where I've had to guard both of them in a series and it's extremely difficult. The way they play, the way they complement each other, especially being aggressive getting into the paint, both being great playmakers in the first game, balancing that with scoring and making everybody better I'm glad I'm on this side."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, for sure. He's probably our best defender, so hearing that is pretty empowering. Really all you're trying to do is make it as hard as you can on a guy like Luka. He's so good. He's going to make some tough shots even if you do play really good defense. You have to know its going to happen and just have to have a next-play mentality in terms of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"We were really connected last game, and we have to continue to be that way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"Just try to help the team win in any possible way and bring energy. I thought I did a pretty good job of that. You know, just got to continue to do that, and that's probably going to be my role throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,I work on it every day in practice. You don't really get an opportunity to shoot them in the game very often. I think I maybe had one or two throughout this season. But that one just happened to be the NBA Finals and people are making a big deal out of it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I don't know, I mean, I put the work in, and sometimes you get to showcase it like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I had a great community growing up that supported me and helped me, you know, get to this point for sure and had influence on my path growing up. It's pretty cool to have those people still reaching out, like schoolteachers, coaches. Obviously, my family and friends always have kept tabs, but it's pretty cool to have those people reaching out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"You've just got to be disciplined. My mom always says, just treat others with respect, and you're bound to receive that from them as well. Just treat everyone the same and put your work in. Don't worry about what other people say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I would just say he's like got a unique approach to the game. He pulls things from, like, soccer teams, pulls things from killer whales and how they go about finding food and prey, things like that, and he ties it into the game of basketball. And I think it's a unique way to go about it. It's different and cool and engaging."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,I'll let him. I dont really know how to describe it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I mean, nothing in particular. Just I didn't even do it before the game. It was more of something I could turn to when I need something to switch things up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I feel like if you need extra motivation to play in the NBA Finals, you're probably in the wrong business. I was ready to go and get back out there and just got to continue, like I said before, just bring energy and help this team any way possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,First stretch of the game I tried to come up and tried to be aggressive and try to help my team. Just trying to put pressure and try to make possessions and try to find my teammates when they was open.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"No, he has not shown us film of his old playing days, but he does do a good job of emphasizing us playing with pace and pushing the pace and playing fast."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"I feel like the bond is growing stronger. We are around each other every day and we talk to each other, hang out and play games. I feel like our bond is really close."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"It's always good to learn from Sham. He's a good person. Always come here with joy and his background and history behind this game and with the moves Sham got, he just brought a lot of history to this game. You know, it's just good to have people like him out here helping us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,He's been telling us from the jump before we even got here that coming into this thing it was going to be a fight and staying composed and composure and sticking together. There are times when they go on runs in a game. So sticking together and staying together throughout their runs.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"And I feel like if we do a good job of doing that and going into Game 2 and playing with physicality and pace, we will have a good chance of winning Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"To all the Mavericks fans that traveled here, we appreciate you all and we love you, and we are going to try to get this win for you all and go back 1-1 to Dallas with the series tied."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"Just staying positive. We've been in this situation before many times, just in this year. So I think for us just being positive and knowing how good we are as a team and just being aggressive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"The same way that happened in OKC and in the Clippers series, making sure that we stay together as a team. Look at adjustments we need to make, and we have done that. Go over film and look at the mistakes we've made and just make a positive from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"It was great. Everybody dreams of being in the Finals. That first bit of getting the jitters out. It's amazing, amazing fans. It was a great atmosphere and it's what basketball is about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. Our team is a very close team. Probably the closest team I've ever been on. It's a family. We have young guys. It's a young team. The guys, everyone really likes each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,I think that's what really helps our team is how connected we are and we are able to make adjustments. We are also able to talk openly about what we need to do to improve our game and how we can help one another.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,Not Luka. I don't know. Anyone but Luka.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"He does an amazing job. In his mind, it's another game. At the end of the day, we have one thing, and that's to win a championship. So I think he's done an amazing job of being a leader and a front-runner for this team. He's been a leader the whole year, and it really rubs off on the team and is contagious."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. I think being nervous is completely normal, especially for me. So I think just being here and being a part of it, it's fun. To me, being nervous isn't a bad thing. But at the end of the day, now it's time for us to make sure we are doing everything we can to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"We need to be more aggressive, and we need to be way more aggressive. Looking back at every single one of these playoff series, we've been the aggressive team. And, yeah, just communication-wise. Just small things can really help out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"I just think how together we are as a team. Like I said, the coaches do an amazing job of reacting to situations. Going back to the drawing board. Realize what we need to do as a team and be able to show the team, and I think the guys are good at making the adjustments we need to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, I've seen a lot of things that we can adjust on and be better at. We have to push guys in, play inside the perimeter. That was pretty much just the main thing. Better transition defense and taking care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I have a lot of confidence in this team. We have always found ways to take that next step in the right direction, because we like having adversity and always came together instead of tearing apart. That's the main thing we focused on going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,We always get hit in the mouth in the first game. Leaves a bad taste in our mouths. We have to come out the next game to rinse that out.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,Just the energy around it. We know that there are things that we can be better at from the first game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much every day, just like after media. We are going to be watching film after this. It's always easy to sit down and go through the things that we can obviously do better and be better at. When it comes to the coaches, we always kind of like joke around here, like, oh, do it again. But this is what it takes to be able to survive at this stage. This is the last series of the year for us. Survival of the fittest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not necessarily. I feel like he took the right approach to everything he did. He was in foul trouble, but he stayed poised. A lot of guys, they will get in their own head, get aggravated, frustrated. He stayed with it, and that's something that shows maturity on his side just being a young guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just shows the better of the two sides. In the first half, we didn't really play good. We came out in the second half with our heads on straight. It just shows that we can take that step in the right direction, just put us in position to withstand for 48 minutes. We don't want to come out and just let anybody punch us in the face. We have to find ways to react the right way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,Be as physical as we were the first game. And just pray he doesn't make all his mid-range.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Really just have the confidence in our offense, making sure that we have poise and really just not getting sped up when it comes to the pace offensively. They are a scrappy team defensively. We have to find ways to get around that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think just be a little bit more aggressive. I think we all came out for the game with little energy. So I think we have to be better with our energy especially from the start."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"No, I don't think so. I mean, we talk about it, but we've just got to stay together. I think we talk about, too, we've got to talk more on the court than we did in Game 1. So that's got to be better from my side, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's big. This is the team that drafted me, and the team that believed in me. So I'm really happy to represent Dallas. Hopefully it's not the last time. But I think the whole Dallas fan base is proud of our team. So I'm happy to represent them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know, but I'm just trying to have fun. That's the game I love. That's the game that gets me paid. And nothing better in the world than playing basketball for your job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,So just trying to enjoy it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,I already knew it. Laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"Not yet. I mean, not since he was -- he signed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, it just depends on how fast we get the ball up the floor. If we are walking the ball up the floor and we start the offense at 17 or whatever, it's different from you starting your offense at 20 because you've got the ball up the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"So I think that goes into it, if you've got a little bit more time, maybe you can scan the floor a little bit. But for the most part, you want to kind of make quick decisions and keep the ball moving."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,I don't have no reaction.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I don't know. It's a team game. We're trying to focus on that, and, you know, everybody has their own opinions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,Say that one more time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, coming out even more aggressive but even more disciplined. You know, Dallas is a really good team, and they have responded very well to Game 1 losses. They come back in Game 2. So we're going to get a forceful, more aggressive team on Sunday, tomorrow. We've got to be ready because they are really good after a loss. So we can't be surprised, and that's what I'm preparing my team for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just trying to keep them off balance. They got -- they are here for a reason. They are well-coached. They do their roles. They perform their roles well. So can't give them the same look every time because they are -- you know, the more comfortable they get, the better they are."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,So just try to keep them off balance.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I remember it being a pretty cool experience. I see some young guys in our league now, like walking around and stuff like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's pretty cool when I was -- it was before I got drafted, like you said, and I was still, you know, fresh out of college and, you know, I knew some -- because I played at Cal Berkeley, I knew some of the guys on the Warriors. Steve Kerr's son was my friend at Cal. I went to a lot of Warriors games that season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"You know, I got to meet a lot of those guys and talk to a lot of those guys before I even got to the NBA. Mainly Andre Iguodala, who is like an older brother, mentor, to me now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, you know, those experiences were everything. You know, being able to see what a winning environment looked like. Being able to talk to guys who have done things at the highest of levels and then give you encouraging words and wish you well and good luck. That was -- that was my experience in the NBA Finals in 2016 or whenever that was before I got drafted. I think that's part of the reason why I was able to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But we've been just extremely focused on what our roles and our jobs are. We have all had to sacrifice. Jason Kidd has had to do that at the highest of levels, right, and I respect him and tip his cap for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Right now, at this point, it's whatever it takes to win and we can't let any outside interpretations try to get in between us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought the crowd was good. I think we can be a little bit better. So I expect us to be even louder. Sunday, we are going to need our fans to be hyped. It's not just team versus team. It's crowd versus crowd. It's gas station versus gas station. Supermarket versus supermarket. It's the whole city versus the whole city. We need everybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just watching film, taking your time. Seeing and reading the game. Being aggressive. Not hesitating. But also, you know, making the right plays. Like you said, being in the right spot. Spacing has a lot to do with that. Making sure our team is properly spaced, and then being aggressive from there. We expect them to be a lot more aggressive on defense, Dallas, coming out into this Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,So that's going to put an emphasis on us to be more disciplined. We have to get to our spacing well. We've got to make the right read. Got to take care of the ball. Can't do stupid fouls because we expect a great punch from them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"It's a little bit of everything. I mean, Joe kind of gives us the freedom to trust our instincts, and then you also know that, like, if someone gets beat, someone's going to have your back, and we just fly around after that. So just a little bit of everything and just competing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think, like, we just took a breath, stayed together, stayed composed, and just kind of got good looks offensively, moved the ball. We got good looks, and I feel like that close in the third was huge. Kind of just put 'em away, kept a distance. So credit to the guys that are out there just staying together, getting stops defensively, and making the right reads offensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, you never really know, coming back from injury. We just seen him -- all the hard work he's been putting in. But you, like, never really know, to miss all that time and come back for The Finals. But he was unreal today and it's nice to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we just won one game. We know they're going to be better. I think we have seen it in the playoffs this year. Like, they have lost Game 1's and they came back and played better. So just it's one game. We got to learn from it, we got to grow, and understand that we're going to need to play a lot better Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"He's a matchup nightmare. Even when you play good defense, he doesn't really see you. It's been unreal just watching him all year. Then defensively, he uses his size well, just impacts the games in so many different ways. He changes us and he makes us a better team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it can be anybody. I think it was JB that timeout. But Al, JT, Jrue. I can say, like, that's the great thing about this team, is if there's something that needs to be said, people are going to say it and we're willing to accept that and grow from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"So, I mean, it can be anybody that's playing. Like X Xavier Tillman has said stuff in the past that has helped us, so there's a lot of guys that have the voice and we're just learning and growing with each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, they're a really good team. They're going to make runs, they're going to make tough shots, they're going to -- I mean, they're going to make it difficult for us. We didn't expect it to be easy. I mean, I wish you could just stop it after, like, one point, that would be nice, but I think you just got to figure out why you're struggling and just try to limit those mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, JB'S unreal on the perimeter. I mean, blocking shots obviously he had two big-time blocks. He can just do everything on the basketball court and he has like no weaknesses on both sides. So, he's big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think anytime you go through something like that and all the experience that we've gathered through like the ups, the downs, like, all that has just helped us to be a better team. So we've learned from everything and, like, this core group has been together through a lot of adversity, so I definitely think it helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, those two are unreal, great players, great teammates, and they just do so many little things for us on both sides of the basketball, so it's amazing having them as our team on our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"It felt great. To be honest, I was nervous. I ain't going to lie. I was nervous in like an anxious way, as like a little kid. It's surreal being in The Finals. When you're young, I guess, in your career, you think you're always going to go back. Last year was kind of like a wake-up call when we didn't make it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,So getting back to this point and being here is really a big deal. We played well tonight. There's a lot of things we feel like we could do better. But it definitely does feel good to win the first game. But we know that two years ago we won the first game and the outcome of that series. So we still have a lot of work to do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, you always want to have your team at full strength. We're a good team when guys are down, but we're really, really special when we have everybody. I said it earlier, how seamless his transition was after being away for six, seven weeks, and coming into the game and having a first half like that, that was a big spark for us to start the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,Thanks for reminding me.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think you guys got a pretty clear picture of that throughout the season, when we were healthy for most of that and how we played and how effective we were on both ends. KP had a big hand in that and the success that we had this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Obviously, getting hurt in the playoffs, we had to figure it out. We had to adjust and play different lineups and whatever. 12-2 up to that point, we did a really good job. But it is a relief to have him back because we know we're a much better team when he's back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, and they go hand in hand. Al has stepped up into that starting role and at this stage in his career being a, you know, center piece of us getting to The Finals is something that shouldn't be overlooked. His presence out there on both ends of the floor, what he allows us to do offensively, dragging out the big men. You know, and we have had playoff games where Al has hit six, seven threes. Even if he doesn't, you have to, the other team has to respect him as a shooter, so it just helps with our spacing. So, can't give Al enough credit for the impact that he's had on this playoff run."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think when you look at JB, he's somebody that has really worked on his craft year after year to just become a better player. I think you can tell by the way that the game has slowed down for him and the way he's making reads on the offensive end. That doesn't happen just overnight, it's a process. And I've seen it, I've seen the work that he puts in and watching film and things like that. So it's special to see when guys put in the work and it translates to on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think just, being his teammate for seven years, we've been in so many big games, we've been in so many big moments, and just always being there to answer the call in those moments, especially on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"I think our offense got a little stagnant and it had a lot to do with our spacing. They kind of put us into some bad ways on offense which kind of threw off our spacing and slowed us down. They started to get stops, running in transition, but that's part of it. They're going to make shots. That's a really good team over there. We just did a great job of responding in realtime after Joe called that timeout. They cut it to eight, we came to the bench and talked about it, executed and made plays and took the lead back up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Just staying present, staying in the moment. Like I said, I was, in a positive way, I was nervous before the game. I was like a kid first day of school. I know how exciting and big of a deal all of this is, so just finding a space to enjoy the moment and have fun playing basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Something that we have harped on all season, what makes our team really special is we don't have guys that we hide on defense. Bigs and guards, we switch, we take on the challenge of individual defense. Understanding that we have help, it's a team sport, we all got to be on the same page, but we're not showing or anything like that, because that could kind of compromise your defense. And, essentially, like, if you want to play on our team you have to be able to guard, and everybody knows that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to say like -- I didn't doubt him, but I just, you know, coming off an injury and missing that much time, it normally takes guys a little longer than that, but as somebody as tall and talented as he is, he makes it look really easy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Maybe last year, us losing in the Conference Finals. Maybe I just expected that after we lost in 2022 that it was guaranteed that we were just going to keep coming back, and this is like our time. Last year it was just kind of a wake-up call to not take anything for granted, because you never know how many opportunities that you might have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Thank you all for being here. I want to begin with someone who is a familiar face at the Finals, and that's Bill Walton, who we lost last week. Of course, Bill won two championships but also covered multiple NBA Finals for NBC and then ABC. He and his wife, Lori, often sat, as many of you remember, at these press conferences, usually somewhere over there. I'm thrilled that Lori Walton is going to actually be at the game tonight, and Bill's four sons are going to be here, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The Celtics team was looking for a way to honor him tonight, and in addition to a pregame moment, the Celtics players are going to be wearing a special Bill Walton shooting shirt. So you're going to be seeing these shortly. The guys are going to be coming out and warming up in this jersey. We're happy about that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In addition, Bill was someone who became a very close friend in the over the 30 years that I've been with the league. Many of you in this room have been covering the league for a long time, as well, and he traveled with us everywhere we went. I remember the first time we played in China, in 2004, being on the Great Wall with him. He was quite an adventurer. I can't think of a better ambassador for the NBA than Bill. He enjoyed talking to every single person."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Increasingly, internationally who understood he must have played basketball, wasn't quite sure who he was, and he would explain to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But even some of you know, right up until this past season, he was working. He was doing an alternate telecast with us called Throw It Down, and even Bill sort of continued to cover the game, couldn't stop complimenting the current players. I think he saw the staggering ability of these young guys and was constantly complimenting them. Every generation of young player came to know him. And just lastly say he'll be missed, and my condolences to Lori and his four boys. It's a sad moment in the league."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Speaking of NBA's international presence, I know there are 26 different countries represented here today with media members, so I want to thank you for traveling so far to be here. In addition, these Finals will be carried in 214 countries and territories. This group of players will represent the largest contingent of international players ever we've had in the Finals 13 players of the combined two teams were born outside of the United States. So the global growth of the NBA continues unabated."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Basketball as a sport continues to grow enormously on a global basis. Wonderful to see how much is happening in the women's game, as well, in the WNBA here in the United States, and we're looking forward to the Paris Olympics, where basketball will be a mainstay, men's and women's. Another exciting time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It was interesting, I was watching Luka Doncic yesterday, just an example of how international this league is. Of course, someone who grew up in Slovenia and trained in Madrid and Spain and was doing interviews in three different languages. Again, many of you spend time with him, but he's an exemplar of the modern NBA."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"And with that, I'm happy to answer questions. I only speak one language, unfortunately, so please in English. Thank you again for being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Well, just begin by saying I don't want to cover specifically on what's been written in the media other than to say, yes, absolutely. I would just say plural, where you say TV deal, it's TV deals. Of course, there's discussions with our incumbents and other interested parties."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It is incredibly complex. I look at my colleague Bill Koenig sitting in the front row, president of our media division, who has been literally working around the clock on this, along with a team of others at the league office. And it's complicated for several reasons. One is the advent of new platforms, particularly streaming, and the interest of streaming companies, and then the traditional media companies also carrying our games on streaming platforms."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It's complicated with multiple partners all seeking similar assets. In many cases, just figuring out the right way to balance those games as they go to different partners."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Then lastly, as you've said, we tend to do long-term deals. We think that's good for the stability of the league, but it means to a certain extent you're trying to predict the future, which is of course impossible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"So part of it is a bet on the partners that we will ultimately align with and their ability also to adjust with the times and their willingness to continue to invest in media and also become global, which to my earlier point is very important to the league, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Sure. The advent of Team Ignite, for those of you who don't know, a team of younger players playing within the G League, in essence a select team, was in response to both President Obama, then at the time in office, who was pushing us hard and the basketball community to create a professional track for players who were not interested in playing college basketball, and at a time when they were not being compensated for playing college basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In addition, it was the result of conversations with Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, who was overseeing a committee on behalf of the NCAA, who made similar recommendations and said that I think our view was that these young men should not be forced somehow to go to college, if the only reason they were going to college was in preparation for the NBA as opposed to preparation for life. Our response was, we hear you, and we created this Team Ignite program. We were paying these players directly."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think Team Ignite served its purpose. I don't necessarily think that the changes in NIL, legislation and these ongoing changes in college sports were a direct result of it. I think it helped, though, demonstrate the value for these young players, but we got to the point now with Team Ignite where frankly we felt it didn't make sense to compete against these top college programs, where in many cases have better facilities, top-notch coaching, charter aircraft, et cetera."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"We thought this was a good time to step back and reassess what our role should be in junior basketball. Not just with the G League, but I'll add I've had some discussions with Charlie Baker, the head of the NCAA, about the joint role we potentially can play in helping even at a younger age helping develop top-flight youth basketball, boys, girls, young men, young women, in the United States in particular. I think that is something that we should focus on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It's interesting, as you look at the growing body of international players in the NBA, Luka Doncic as an example before, who in essence went on a professional track beginning at 13 with Real Madrid, there's clearly some improvement we could use in the U.S. system for the training of these elite players. There's no doubt they come into the league as some of the most skilled players in the world, but in many cases they haven't -- it's not that they haven't learned team basketball, but because of the way the system works, they're constantly changing teammates, they're jumping from program to program. You can tell that the international players in many cases are just learning a different style, and in some cases a more efficient and winning style of basketball, team play basketball than we're seeing in some of the U.S. programs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"So I would add USA Basketball to the NCAA and the NBA and I'm sure that shoe companies have an interest in doing this, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Pulling back on Team Ignite was just the beginning, but I think as we complete our media deals, for me this will be, and Mark Tatum, Deputy Commissioner, is sitting here, will be one of our next major projects. So we're really focused on what our role should be in youth basketball in the United States and globally, for that matter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I'll leave the specific question about the foul to my colleague, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. Other than as a fan, obviously it's nothing new in basketball that there's sort of ""welcome to the league"" moments, especially for heralded rookies, but of course I want to see Caitlin treated fairly and appropriately in the league."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I would say it seems like she can take care of herself. She's a tough player. I think it may be lost on some people that are new to basketball, in terms of a little bit of controversy in the WNBA, what an incredible talent she is two Final Fours, leading scorer in the history of college basketball. I look forward to watching her ongoing development in the league."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think ultimately this is very healthy for women's basketball and the WNBA. It's generating tremendous additional interest. In fairness to the other players and in fairness to Commissioner Engelbert, this didn't just start this year. Certainly we're seeing an acceleration of it with Caitlin, but many individual stars who came in this league in the last several years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"And then, again, I've been with the league for a long time. So I was there in the early days with Val Ackerman, and of course David Stern, when we developed the WNBA. In some ways, to me, this was a long time coming. If you went back and looked at our original business plan from 28 years ago, we didn't think it would be such a long timeline to break into the popularity we're seeing now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Ultimately, I don't want to make too big of an issue about one particular player, one particular call. But I think the burgeoning rivalries within professional basketball, you see rivalries obviously among clubs but also among individual players, too, and I think that can be ultimately good for the sport."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But at the same time, there's also some larger societal issues at work. There's no doubt. I don't want to hide from that. Some having to do with race, and they're very apparent. I think sports historically has been a platform for people to talk directly about these issues. I don't think we should hide from them, and I think the players are happy to engage on these issues. They're sophisticated people. But ultimately let the public join part of those conversations, as well, and of course the media will weigh in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Well, part of it, I don't want to sound overly confident, it has much to do with watching where media is moving, where top-notch content now that we're seeing on the various streaming platforms, the fact that maybe Netflix being the latest in terms of their Christmas Day deal for NFL games, that many of these platforms that only six months or a year ago that were reluctant to come to premium live sports are now jumping in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"If you watch where the eyeballs are going, and I'm sure it's true for people in this room, as well, we're all moving into watching premium programming on streaming services."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Also, part of where my confidence goes in moving sports over to streaming platforms and something I've talked about before, it allows for tremendous additional functionality when it comes to watching games, personalization, customization of games, multiple feeds, multiple dialects, multiple languages, different camera angles. It really gives the fan enormous additional choice that you don't have through traditional television."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Trying to predict how fast this will move is I think what's so difficult. I think there's been a faster decline in cable viewership, cable usage and viewership than people were predicting even only two years ago, and the move is happening fast to streaming services. So what we're trying to do as part of these television deals is middle sort of the use still of the broadcast platform. Of course, the Finals are on ABC in the United States. Still matters tremendously to us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Traditional cable, it's not going away, but it's continuing to decrease. And then streaming platforms are seeing accelerated growth, particularly around premium live sports. We're sort of trying to put foot, hand, finger in sort of every one of those buckets."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of what Dallas did last year, we sanctioned them. We did what we thought was appropriate at the time. I would only say that the success they saw this season, that they're now seeing in the Playoffs and here they are at the Finals, I don't attribute it to one draft pick, as important as that draft pick has been to their team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Look, I'd say Pat McAfee, that's what you're referring to, he apologized, and I accept that. I think that the way media works these days, when people are online for hours, they're going to occasionally misstep. I think what's important is the context, their intention and sort of what they're willing to say about having done that. I leave it to ESPN to make their own personnel decisions about what the consequences of things like that. But I accept sort of in a free society, where there's a lot of conversation, a lot of dialogue, and I think it's for the WNBA, of course, it's going to be a two-edged sword."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Many of us in this room go back to David Stern, where we sat in meetings and he was pleading with some of the very reporters sitting her to cover the WNBA and women's basketball. Now we're being covered, and once you get covered in an extensive way, it's a little bit of a product of how media works these days, that you're going to see occasional statements that people aren't happy with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I think that my sense is at least what I read, the player accepted the apology. I think in the context of how he said it, I think matters a lot these days."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I don't want to get into sort of the cliched cancel culture debate. But I worry about that, that sort of this notion that if somebody seems to be a person of goodwill is saying things that in the context seem actually supportive of the player but says a word like that, that we all say shouldn't have been said, and he's the first to acknowledge he shouldn't, I don't want to overblow it. I think that we can move on from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Bill Koenig, can you tell me when the media deals will be over so I can begin the expansion process? Laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In all seriously, I meant what I said. We do need to finish up -- I think I said a few years ago, collective bargaining agreement, new media deals, then we would turn to expansion. So we got part one done clearly, and thank you to the Players Association. We are very happy, I think both sides are, with our collective bargaining agreement."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I'm absolutely fine with that. It's interesting, times change. There used to be concerns even geographically of players from a certain part of the country and how will they feel about that player in that market, because the player played for a top college somewhere else or from somewhere else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think it's increasingly a global league in that wherever that player is from, and Luka Doncic is a great example, Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee, I think if that player becomes part of that community, lives in that community, gives of himself or herself in the WNBA to that community, I think they become part and parcel. I don't think it's any different that I went to Duke University and when a player is playing for Duke and Duke fans are all in, they're not so focused on where that player is from, whether in the United States or Luol Deng or other players from outside the United States."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It's a global market. At the same time, I will say to my earlier point, it is important that we focus on proper development of American players. I just think for the sport, still we're a U.S.-based business, the majority of our revenue still comes from the United States. I feel an obligation to the game, as well, and I know I speak for the head of the NCAA, who played college basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Over time, like for example, we're up to about 30 percent of our players are international. When you think about the amount of basketball being played globally and the U.S. is a little less than 5 percent of the global population, that number of international players will only rise. Statistically, you're going to see more top-notch international players in the league. It doesn't mean, though, that there won't still be great U.S. players, many of whom we're going to see on the court tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It has been difficult. That show in particular is special. I have a close relationship with everyone who's on that show, from the time they played in the league, as well, and Ernie and I have been friends forever."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"At the same time, it's not just the talent, of course. You've been in production yourself. There's hundreds of longtime people who have been involved with what I still refer to as Turner Sports, who have been longtime friends and colleagues, and no different at the other networks."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"On one hand, from the league standpoint, it's fantastic to be liked and to be wanted and to have multiple suitors. At the same time, it makes me uncomfortable that it's zero sum, that at the end of the day there's only going to be so many television packages, there's only so many Finals games and playoff games and regular-season games to distribute."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I will say directly from me, directly to your question and the people who seem to be most impacted right now, the folks at Turner Sports, I apologize that this has been a prolonged process, because I know they're committed to their jobs. I know people who work in this industry. It's a large part of their identity and their family's identity, and no one likes this uncertainty. I think it's on the league office to bring these negotiations to a head and conclude them as quickly as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of the last part of your question, we're not considering right now opening up control of teams to institutional capital. We think it's still very important that there be individuals and ultimately a singular governor who has ultimate decision making for a team. We've seen examples historically where, putting aside institutions, there have been multiple individuals, and it's led to all kinds of contention and controversy. So I don't see that happening, at least in the foreseeable future."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of institutional capital being invested in teams, in some ways it's a good problem to have, as you said, as the value of these teams continue to grow and grow at a fast pace. There are only so many individuals literally in the world who can cut those sort of checks to invest in the majority of capital required to purchase these teams."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"So we think we've found ourselves in a pretty good spot where you have individuals with control pieces of team, other individuals who are investing alongside of them, but then to complete the cap chart, you have institutional investors. The institutional investors, of course because the values are going up right now, seem very pleased with those investments. I think historically we were concerned, before we allowed institutional investors, that they would be short-timers and that they would be looking to quickly flip their investments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"We haven't seen that. In fact, this is your area, not mine, from the Financial Times, that it's become more sort of permanent capital in a way as opposed to being short-term investments. The investment community is looking now at sports teams, particularly premium sports teams, not just the NBA, as an investment category in a diversified portfolio that in many cases moves in an alternative ways from the market as a whole. It rounds out a portfolio and it seemingly is working well for everyone right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Lastly, I'll just say that this policy is only a few years old. Institutional investors who don't comply with our current policy, some particular funds have been in to see us, and to say we would like to be an investor in your league or in teams, and would you consider adjusting some of your policies, not necessarily to allow us to be a control owner, maybe they would like that one day, but in other ways, to ease up some of the restrictions, and that's something that we'll continue to look at. By the way, I know the NFL is looking at some of these same issues right now, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"First of all, as you said, that's an ongoing process in terms of the arbitration. That was a process they agreed to in the purchase agreement. The league office is completely independent of that. Yes, the next step, were they to win that arbitration, would be then to continue through the league vetting process, and then ultimately what would be required would be a vote of the Board of Governors to approve them as owners."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The only reason I won't comment on that is because that would be obviating the entire vetting process that needs to continue, and then is ultimately for the owners to take that vote."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It may impact things if we were now at the point where they had won the arbitration and the group was being vetted for ownership. But as far as I know, and I only -- I don't have personal knowledge of that deal, I read it, as well, that's independent of the issues that are now at issue in the arbitration."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"When it comes to injury data, we're constantly studying it, trying to see if there's more than correlation and there's actually causation. Of course, this past season, even though we had the 65-game rule, largely designed to keep star players on the floor, we had a decrease in injury in star players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I'm not standing here saying one followed from the other. It just may be happenstance for this season. I think we saw injuries, of course, in the Playoffs this year, but nothing that out of range with injuries we've seen in the past."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think, look, there's nothing more important than keeping our players on the floor. One of the things I know Andre Iguodala and I, it's great having him now as the head of the Players Association, just based on his experience as a star player in this league, a championship-caliber player, that we're trying to step back and say, what is it that we need to do to incentivize guys to play and keep them healthy, and are there things we need to adjust in the schedule, are there other areas. You're talking about the Playoffs now that we look at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I will say just based on one season of data, we're happy with the 65-game rule. There was sort of a parade of horribles that had rolled out, that had been rolled out, that everybody was saying, were threatening were going to happen. Those things didn't happen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of not just a reduction in star player injuries this year, but it worked to the extent we saw star players on the floor more. That was the goal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Whether there's some connection in terms of additional injuries and Playoffs, we don't know. This is an area that confounds us in some ways. I will say that we worked with the players successfully in the collective bargaining agreement on this issue, and I think with Andre's leadership, sort of a commitment on both sides, let's keep looking at it. We have the same incentives, and that is to keep star players on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Fair question. It's where we should be able to make the most progress. As I've said before, you're always going to have human error in the case of referees. It doesn't mean we can't continue to do a better job training officials."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But when it comes to technology, again, it's one of the things we've been talking to the Players Association a lot about and the Referees Association, too, and I'm thinking once the season ends this year, maybe we even put together a task force of the constituent groups. A guy named Evan Wasch in the League Office is leading this initiative. We're in discussions with Hawkeye, the technology they use in tennis. As I've said for a while, it's harder than I understood it to be, but if there's a category of objective calls that you can not only take off the floor but frankly out of the replay center. Buzz, Celtic ball, because it's automated, foot on the line, which one of the hundred fingers on the floor touched the ball last at that time. As I said they're working through that. But technology will solve that, and I think it's the same for replay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,I'm not going to get into that only because it's a complex legal issue.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think obviously what helped me is just even from the walk out before the game and then getting on the court, getting that kind of support was unreal. The adrenaline was pumping through my veins and that definitely helped. Obviously it wasn't ideal that I was out for such a long time, but I did everything I could to prepare mentally for this moment coming back and it paid off and we got the job done tonight and had a good game and happy about the result."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, from day one I came here and I said like I'll do whatever it takes to help this team win, right? I think it was -- this situation, you know, it made sense. I didn't care. I didn't care. I knew I could prepare to come off the bench, which is something different for me, and that's what I did and stepped into that role and embraced it and had a good game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no. Yeah -- what was the question? Laughing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, at the end of the day, it's like, it's just basketball. It's okay, it's high intensity, it's like more -- you know, like, intricacies of the game and stuff, like, more focus on little details. But at the end, it's just basketball and I've been doing this for a long time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Even if I have time off, I can jump right back in and I feel the same way. I get to my spots and I do, so whether it's playoffs regular season or whatever, I know how to do this. That's it, just having that confidence, going out there whatever, first round or Finals, just going out there with full confidence and giving what I have to the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know, even when that first quarter when I checked in and start things going my way and stuff, I didn't even think about it. I was so in the moment and enjoying the moment and the crowd and everything, you know. I don't know, it's kind of like a blur to me right now. I have to re-watch the game, what happened and stuff, but I was completely just in the game. That's the best feeling. Like, I had the most fun and, yeah, and I hope to have more of those moments going forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not in a sense of, like, am I going to be okay. Like, it was only like physical. Am I going to be good to go physically, not -- skills-wise, there was never -- at least for me never no doubt. But of course, you have ups and downs throughout the game, like all this stuff happens, but mainly for me, it was to get there physically and once I felt pretty good and the medical staff had my back and we did everything correct to get to this point, then they gave me the green light, I was good to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, we had a conversation and just came up to me, I know he knew I was going to be fine with whatever, you know, so he just told me, what do you think, like about this, and I said, of course, like, let's do it. And that's it. Wasn't no big deal and I trust Joe and he trusts me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know, but Joe always gives us the right message, you know what I mean? He himself is very almost -- like, he can be emotionless if that's what we need and he can just come in, like, completely even keel and give us the right message of what to focus on. And then he can come in and give us some motivation if that's what we need in that moment, some energy. But I think there he was just even keel and giving us some of the answers to what we need to do out there and that was it, we trust him with his leadership."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, a little bit of everything. A little bit of everything, right. It's tough to not play for a month and then jump into the highest intensity game in The Finals, it's obviously very tough. But as I said, I did everything I could to prepare for this moment, like mentally, and then just going out there and playing instinctually almost, you know, and trusting my body. And that was it. And as I said, like the support around me was great to get to this moment, and now, yeah, we just have to keep going and take care of business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just thought it gave us the best chance to win. He was great on both ends of the floor, defensive execution, game plan, playing for a spot in the offensive end, being physical, and making plays on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just poise. They have a great defensive system, great defensive team, throw a bunch of stuff at you, different spacings, different coverages. The poise to just figure it out. Make the right play is going to be the most important thing. I thought he had that throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, game management is going to be important. This is a great team. They have a tendency to go on great runs. That's going to happen. You have to be able to manage those with poise and execution, know why those runs are being made, and quickly put a stop to them with high-level execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"So KP was a huge part of that, that run. But I liked the way we handled their run, because that's going to happen. You're not going to stop that. You just have to have the poise and the toughness to work through it and I thought our guys did that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"What you saw tonight is kind of the challenge he took for himself coming into the year. Not wanting to be defined by one thing. Wanting to make plays. Wanted to be a well-rounded player and get better and better. So his spacing, his ball movement, his defense on ball and off ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Usually when you give up a run and your offense gets a little stagnant, your defense goes with it. Tonight our defense kept us in it and that's really important, to have that defensive mindset. Some of those plays that Jaylen made were a part of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think a couple of great passes. JT stuck out, the one Jaylen threw to Al in the corner. I think it was either Jaylen or JT. But that's what those guys do, they have the ability to draw two guys and the most important thing is making the right play over and over again, doing what's best for the team, reading the two on ones, and when they're at their best, those guys are able to do that. I thought their decision making helped control the game, especially when they went on that run and we were able to get that back. We went back to -- with JT there and he was able to help us sustain that with a high-level execution, so that's really important when those guys do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I always talk to the players about what we think is best for the team and that it's that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know. I can't remember.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"The one when they cut it to eight? Yeah, listen, it's the NBA Finals, you're playing against a great team and they're going to make runs. Just building on awareness to why the run was made and, you know, that team does a great job of making defensive adjustments on the fly and sometimes it takes us a possession or two to recognize that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"So just understanding the run, what could we do to change it, and how can we get better coming out of that. So I thought the guys' poise out of that timeout was big and that's going to happen. They're going to go on more runs and we're going to have to fight through 'em."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, again, I thought our defensive mindset, our defensive execution, our defensive game plan, our positioning, we had the right intentions and I thought we played really physical, for the most part, defending without fouling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"And on the offensive end, we made some physical drives, and so that's the key there, is just having the physical mindset on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I know the story line has to be, what's he going to look like because he was off for a month, but that's what he's been doing his whole career. He's a great player. He's been great for us. The reason why we are here is because of what he's done. It doesn't matter how long he takes off, the guy is going to make plays because of how talented he is and the work he puts in. What he did for us tonight was big and we need that for the rest of the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Um-hmm, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Out of the three minutes, two and a half of it they're by themselves, so I'm sure -- they communicate well with each other, they have great relationships, so I'm sure during the time the coaches are meeting that they're having that communication with each other. They do a good job of communicating with each other throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just sticking with the game plan. Game plan execution's very important. Having a clear understanding of what you have to take away on every possession, and just knowing that in order to defend these guys at a high level, you have to play efficient offense, and I thought we did that for the majority of the game, obviously, on the run. There weren't many live ball turnovers and we missed some open shots. They forced us into a couple tough shots, but we were able to manage the transitions of the game with our offensive execution and our defensive game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, they're going to make a lot of adjustments and they're going to do a lot of great things because of the talent that they have, so we have to execute the game plan, communicate coverages, communicate matchups, guys did a great job communicating to each other and keeping defense first."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just great individual defense. Everybody has to take on the challenge of guarding those guys. They're an amazing team and they put a ton of pressure on you with their ability to score. Everyone is going to take their matchup personal, have personal pride in individual defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,He's not on a minutes restriction and we haven't gone through that yet.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Same thing he's done for us all year. Defense, offense, communication, play hard. Just what he's done for us over the course of the season that's helped us get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, Jaylen is the kind of guy that just works hard, has a chip on his shoulder. I would say everything is motivation for him. I enjoy watching him when he works. He has a huge growth mindset and he's going to look to dig deep into weaknesses that he wants to get better at, makes his strengths better, never skips a detail."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"I would say he's one of the higher-motivated guys I've seen, just the way he works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"No. We just talked to the staff, just Celtics, practice, getting better, and that's it really."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Honestly, same way every game day has looked. It's no different. We've got to rebound, we've got to sprint back, we've got to play defense, pay attention to detail. We have to pay attention to spacing, we have to execute, we have to crash. We've got to play hard. I can honestly say it hasn't looked any different, and the things that will go into winning this series are no different than the things that we talked about in preseason, habits, mindset, details, execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Same as they were first game of preseason, got to go out there and play. There's a game plan. We've got to be ready to execute it. But there's going to be adjustments, variables, things you're going to have to go through."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,In the short time I've been around I've been in some big games. The things that go into winning and losing are still the same. We can't be distracted by anything else. We've got to make sure we stick to those details. That's the most important thing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's all the fundamentals of that are the same. You have to communicate. You have to build relationships with people. You have to have a great staff around you. You have to have great players. You have to get those players better. You have to empower people around you. You have to know whatever level you're at what goes into winning and what could lead to losing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think no matter the level, it's all the same, and obviously each level presents different types of challenges, but you rely on those things that can be translated regardless of where you're at to help you, and it's the people around you and the way you can build relationships."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great player. They have a great team. There's no one way to guard these guys, especially when you have to play them over again. So you have to be open-minded to go into different things, absolutely."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"But the game is connected, so the offensive adjustments we make will be in large part by how we defend and our defensive adjustments we make will be in large part how we attack, and the game is connected, and those decisions are made by kind of those things, how one thing affects the other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,But I don't anticipate one solution. You have to have multiple solutions.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"I thought give the Celtics credit. They did a great job defending, making it tough on us. We had some good looks that didn't go down. We've got to move the ball. The ball just stuck too much. And we'll be better in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he had great looks that just didn't go down. He had some great looks at three. He had some great looks in the paint. That's just part of basketball. Sometimes they go in. Sometimes they don't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Tonight, they just didn't go down for Ky or most of the team, and hopefully we get those same shots in Game 2 and we can be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, KP was great, he knocked down shots. He changed shots. He blocked shots. He gave them a spark when he came off the bench."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,We've just got to make it a little bit tougher on the offensive end. We've got to make him do something different. He got great looks and knocked them down.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we did cut it to eight and got the rebound and unfortunately came up with a travel. A lot of good things in that third and fourth that we can build on. That's what we talked about after the game and that's what we have to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We came out and won the third. Had a great opportunity to cut into that lead. Unfortunately, they go on a run. Once we cut it to eight, but then you know we won the fourth. So there are two positive things that we can take from these four quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We've got to be better in the first. They took advantage of that. They knocked down threes. But the big thing is, we have to be better as a team offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,They did great. They did great. And they will get better as the series goes on.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is the best team in the NBA and they are good for a reason. They play their style of basketball at a high rate. They generated 27 threes there in the first half, and made I think 11 of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,So we have to be better. We can't give them seven made threes in the first quarter. That would have outscored us with only scoring 20.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So we have to be better. Give them credit. They were good tonight. But again, we've got to be better. Nerves or not being in this situation, we can't use that as an excuse. It's just basketball, and we've got to be better at the game of basketball on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought the group handled it well. At halftime, we talked about what we had to do, and I thought we did that coming out in the third. Again, cutting that lead, getting it to eight with the ball. Unfortunately, we traveled."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"And then from that point on, they took control of the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But I thought the group responded. I thought we were better in the second half, and hopefully we can build on that third and fourth quarter going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"I think it's just about the positives. What can we do to build on the positives. We'll talk about that tomorrow. Understanding the small things, the physicality. We have to be better at that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But just looking at the positives. Looking at the things that we can control, and then we'll build from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We talked about it at halftime. I thought we weren't having fun there in the first half and we talked about having fun, to work the game, to continue to keep playing. There's a lot of time. A lot of people will talk about one game but we are talking about a series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So the bigger picture is to continue to keep working in the series and I thought the guys did a really good job there in the third quarter. We get the miss. We get the rebound. The momentum is going our way. Unfortunately, we traveled."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So we just have to be better. We know that. Boston is a really good team, and so we've got to be better on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's a great number. Also lets you know that the G League is doing the right thing. The development of the G League and being able to have those players participate on the biggest stage."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Again, 22? That's a lot. That's a great honor, and hopefully one of them can have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Well, you're talking about the second-best defense. We saw the best defense in Minnesota, so now we're going against the second best. Understanding they have a lot of great defenders one-on-one, so we expect that they're going to continue to throw different bodies at Luka and Ky. Those two as our quarterbacks have to be able to read who's guarding them and then being able to get the right guys in the pick-and-roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We truly believe those two will make the right decisions, but when you talk about individual defense, Boston is one that will read a lot of the pick-and-rolls but also in isos just play one-on-one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think there's a lot of different paths. I'm happy when you talk about Hurley being mentioned as a candidate, JJ being mentioned, two different paths that could become head coaches in this league. Both basketball IQs extremely high. Whoever the Lakers choose, it's up to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But when you talk about championships, Hurley has won two at UConn. I've gotten to play with Hurley in high school. He is a warrior. He's a champion. Coaching runs deep in their blood in that family. So if he was to become a Laker, that's incredible for him and his family but also for the Lakers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But JJ also has a basketball IQ and understands how to play the game the right way, and so either candidate is going to be great for the Lakers to choose from, but the path, there's a lot of different paths. Mark Jackson set the path for us, whove gotten older, who could not move, to figure out what we can do next."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So when you talk about the path, Mark Jackson set the path. I'll always thank Mark privately that he gave us old-timers a chance to do something and still be involved in the game at a high level, and so I chose that path and I got lucky that the owners believed that I could do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I haven't really thought about that -- 2011, at the end of that game, just understanding what -- there's no one else to play. We're playing our best basketball, and being rookies, we didn't really know how to celebrate winning a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But when you sit there and you digest the situation of understanding that you just won a championship, it's just surreal because as a kid that's what you dream about. As a kid, you're watching Game 1 Boston against Dallas, and that's all you're working for is to be able to win a championship because you want to be like Magic, you want to be like Mike."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"To be able to do that in '11 was incredible. It's something that I will always treasure. That group of guys that we're linked to with Rick Carlisle as a coach, who led us was incredible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,It's no different than the Western Conference stage. It's basketball. It's just a little bit more of you guys.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But to embrace, as I talked this morning before we started talking about Boston, was the guys who get all the attention or most of the attention, share it with the younger guys who aren't getting interviews. When it is time for them to get interviewed, they know how to handle it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"I just shared that with the team this morning, to understand Ky and Luka, this is also a great time to share how to handle things with the younger players because a lot of them haven't been in this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,Luka has been in this situation since he was born. Ky has been in this situation for a couple times now. For those guys to be able to share it with them is my message.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"The basketball message is it's basketball, to have fun and embrace it and enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Ky and Luka as our quarterbacks, the respect that we have for one another, understand we all three have played the same position. Those two are a little bit more gifted than I am."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"The trust for one another for Ky -- myself, I've known Ky since I played in New Jersey, to see his journey, he's a champion. He's won, and now has us back into the Finals on the biggest stage. He's always enjoyed this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"He always gets to celebrate his birthday first, even though we're born on the same day. But just to understand what he's gone through, that you can grow from different situations, and he's definitely done that, and he's really embraced Dallas, and he's playing his best basketball yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Al's journey, it's been incredible. It just seems like he's getting younger. He's been on great teams. He's always been a great teammate from afar, from what I've heard. Just understanding his skill set, being able to guard everyone on the floor as a teammate, being able to also stretch the floor, being able to shoot the three, and so longevity, he's doing something right when you talk about eating and taking care of your body and also mentally, because it can become draining. It can become where maybe I want to get on with my life and do something different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But again, his goal is to try to win a championship. Our goal is to try to delay that. But again, he's going to be one that's going to have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they've seen every coverage just like Luka and Ky, so we've got to be able to change it up. We can't give them a steady diet of one thing. They'll pick you apart."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Again, when you get multiple bodies on the ball, that's when the three comes into play. Hopefully we can stay out of that situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"We didn't perform the way we would have wanted to tonight. It starts with me just being able to get out there and get us settled. Got to take some accountability for just the communication, and just going out there and getting used to the way that the kind of environment was going to be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But I think my teammates did a great job of staying together, sticking to the game plan. We obviously made some mistakes, like I said, but we gave ourselves a chance in the second half and we just have to continue to do the right things and win the quarters as much as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"They came out and hit us in the mouth early. Got the home crowd going into it. Down 17 in the first quarter. It's not really like us to give up 37 points. It's happened to us before in the playoffs, but we just wanted to make it a lot tougher on them. They hit a lot of threes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, when you get them rolling like that, they play a very easy game the rest of the game, and we've just got to hit them in the mouth a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"They did their job getting Game 1, but we are going to take our lessons and get ready for a good Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't necessarily agree it's a trap they want to set us. I think that they really rely on their great defensive ball pressure and one-on-one defenders. They funnel us into certain areas. Even as I say that, they are relying on the one-on-one, every time I got an iso, there's almost two, three people waiting for me to get in there. I have to catch the ball on a live dribble and just be aware of my opportunities."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's uncharacteristic for us to have only nine assists. The ball has got to move a little bit more. And again, that starts with me just being able to push the pace, get us some easy opportunities, and just adjust to what they are throwing at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"So just going to be replaying some of these possessions. But at the same time, looking at some of the positives that we can carry on to Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's basketball at the end of the day. You know, being in this environment, I'm used to it at this point. Early in my career, there was a different relationship that I had with Boston and just being able to come here, be settled with a veteran group. Now I'm here as a veteran, over the past few years, just experiencing the playoffs here, even regular season, it's been the same thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I thought it was going to be a little louder in here but I'm expecting the same things going into Game 2. Crowd trying to get me out of my element, my teammates out of my element."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But again, the energy has to be focused towards the game. I felt like I had a lot of great looks. They hit back rim or were just a little left or right. Just got to stay confident and stay poised throughout this, man. This is the best time of the year to be playing. There's only two teams left. Let's put it in perspective."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,The environment is going to be what it is but my focus is on our game plan and making sure my guys feel confident and I feel confident and continue to shoot great shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Very proud of them and amazed at how poised they are. This younger generation has a quiet confidence and a knowing about themselves. I think when we hit a little adversity, we have to know how to respond as a group and as a team. We talked about it in a lot of huddles but we have to act on it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what this game is about is controlling our actions, making sure that we stay positive, but also know what we are going up against, the competition level. We are the best in the world at this point. There are only two teams left. We have proven why we deserve to be here and we've earned our right to be here. It's no time to see ourselves as a short opponent or someone that's not capable of coming out of this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's Game 1, but at the same time, we've got two days in between. So there's going to be a lot of noise and a lot of who played well, who didn't play well, who was under pressure. Just telling my guys, now is not the time to fall into that and be divided and be on social media all day listening to people that are not on the court with us. No disrespect to anybody but we are the players out there and we have to control what we can control and be ready to put on for each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just settle in emotionally and just continue to pinpoint the things that were working for us where we are funneling their guys to where we want them to go and offensively playing off a live catch. They do a good job of loading up when we are on the dribble. They do a lot of reaching, a lot of verticality, effort. We have to give them credit. We are going against a great team and now is the time to just look at film, spend the next two days healing up and just getting ready for a physical Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, just look at film and then also be ready to wash our hands of what this game was and how we didn't rise to the occasion to start off the game. Just be able to battle with them during those runs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"They are going to make some threes at times but we want to make them tough. When they are at home, they shoot incredibly well. We knew what we were getting ourselves into but until we experience it, then we wouldn't know."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"This is the first time this group is experiencing the Finals. We don't want to use that as an excuse. We want to use that as a strength. We want to use that energy that we have of just going into it and playing our game to our advantage, and then, you know, we'll see how the chess pieces fall in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it's not the first time I've lost in Boston. I don't want to continue to make it a habit but they've had a few games over me and they have our number -- not our number, I don't want to say our number but the past few teams I've been on, they have had my number a little bit. You have to give credit to a good team. They have been good the past three or four years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"We want to show them respect but at the same time we want to bring our best game. We have to play four of our greatest games in order to win the series and in order to win the Finals. It's not about holding our heads up for one game if we didn't play well. It's the first to four and we obviously know that, but we have to play four complete games, four of our best games, and then we'll see where we stand after that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But in the meantime, we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and it starts with me as one of the leaders on the team, how can I be better and how can I be more poised in this environment. It's not the booing and it's not the missed shots. It's more or less our attitude and how we approach possession by possession. Our identity has been made on the defensive end. We have proven that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I have not had the best games offensively this playoff run but we have been able to get stops, timely stops and been able to pick each other up on the offensive end. We have all-world talent on this team, skillset is out of this roof, but now it's just about remaining confident and always knowing that you have somebody that's been through it but now it's our turn to go through it together. You know, this is what makes it exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, yeah, it's hard to compare just because you're going against different players, different series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But I will say that the next day was pretty cool, you know, because to see us still joined together in practice, still go through our day-to-day routines and rituals, and just hold each other up and hold each other accountable but in a very healthy way. We are very honest about what we can continue to do better and then we are very honest about how we can coach one another to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"We are going to hear the familiar sentiment or familiar phrase that a lot of guys haven't experienced the Finals on our team, and that's okay. Experience is the best teacher, and once you get Game 1 out of the way or Game 2 out of the way you start feeling better about the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But when you lose Game 1, there is a level of disappointment. We are human. I've always said that. We are going to feel the natural emotions. You feel the highs and lows of the journey but when you lose a game like this especially in the Finals where everyone is watching, it's going to hit you a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But again, like I say, now is the time to not get on social media and not pay attention to what you guys are saying, no disrespect, but we've got to go out there and just focus on what we can control."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,I just know how the next two days are going to go. It's going to be very loud. It's going to be very chaotic at times. People are going to have words to say about how we can be better and how we can win or lose the series.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, it's about us focusing on what we can control in that locker room, and we have great leaders in that locker room. So it's not just me who has that the experience that I'm going to be leaning on. I'm going to be leaning on everybody to help me out, too, as I help them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,It felt good. I think the whole key for us was to come out and defend home court and establish ourselves and we did that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,"Everyone was really locked in on the defensive end. The things that we needed to do, we just wanted to be very solid throughout. KP got to an unbelievable place there early in the first half, in the first quarter, and I just felt like it really got us going and took us to another level as a team. That was huge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,"It was great. I was pleasantly surprised to see how good he looked. He was very fluid and a lot of energy and moving well. We know he can score, but defensively he looked really good as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,"I mean, weve kind of known. At the end of the day for us, we understood what the mission was in front of us and what we needed to do. Everyone here was on board."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It feels good to win. But just know that the jobs not done. Never getting too high, too low. Just knowing that weve got to win Sunday and then two more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we set the tone early. That kind of gave us the lead and then when they made their hit, they got it within eight, we could withstand it and push it back up to 20. So we did a good job of just being poised."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,It takes a lot. Lock into the game plan. Two great scorers and playmakers in Luka and Kyrie. It takes a lot. It takes a full team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,Him being him. It was good to see it. You see him go out there and have fun. He brings energy to the game. And how he plays is so fun to see. Glad hes on my side.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think Jayson is just being Jayson. I dont think there is any pressure that he cant handle, on or off the court. But I think on the court, I think him being able to play-make, almost having a triple-double and being the best player on the court is what he does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Im pretty sure. Everybody was ready to go. Its been a long stretch before we had this first game. We finally got that out of our system, so now we should be able to play for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,Of course. This is something that we can learn from and it can help us in the next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,Not necessarily difficult shots. We just have to communicate a lot better and just be better in our principles defensively. Thats what's going to help us withstand the stretch of the runs they made.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, he looked pretty healthy to me. We have to find a way to match his energy and physicality."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,They mostly play one-on-one. They send a lot of help. So that's why.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Of course. You want me to say we have no confidence? Smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Of course.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, he was great for them. He was knocking down shots. He was blocking shots. So he was really, really huge for them on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Their spacing is great and they have a lot of shooters. So I think we have to do a better job taking those threes away.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Just like I said right now. We've got to take those threes away. That's what hurt us the most.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Just playing our basketball. I think in those moments, we were playing our basketball. We were getting stops. We didn't allow them to offensive rebound. We were having fun out there those couple moments, and that's what we've got to do more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Obviously this is a bigger stage. But those games, Finals prepare you for this moment. We pass Game 1. We didn't do our job well. So we've got to focus on the second one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Just focus on the next game. I think we really got good shots. We just didn't make them. But we've got to go game by game. The Game 1 is over. We've got to watch film, what we did wrong, and focus only on the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, obviously, I think they are the best three-point shooting team in the NBA, so sometimes really hard to take those away. Especially when they have five guys out and they can all shoot. Obviously, we've got to make more. We didn't make enough shots today to beat them. But we've got to be better on both ends."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it's a full-team effort. Luka still had 30 and 10, so I got to do a better job. But it's a full-team effort and tonight I got lucky a few times, but we got to get ready for Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think defensively I thought we were -- we made some big-time plays. When they cut it to eight, that's when the game started. I liked how our team responded. We stayed composed. Offensively, we got to our spacing and was able to push that lead back out and make some plays on offense. That was a big third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"What was I feeling? Just trying to make some plays, get my team going. Defense is what we got to hang our hat on. Right there, that was an example of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"It just depends. It just depends on who you're on, it just depends on the spacing of the game, and we got to be able to make plays, and right there, it was just -- I was the low guy, I was on some of those bigs, you don't want to give up lobs. That's one thing that we made an emphasis on. So I don't want to step up too much and give those lobs, but I was able to cat and mouse a little bit and then make some plays at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the game right there. It's going to be -- it's not going to be perfect. It's a long series. I expect them Game 2 to come out with tremendous force and maybe try to hit us in the mouth. So that's the game. When a team goes on a run, you got to manage it, you got to stay composed, and you got to keep playing basketball. It's almost like you just have short-term memory a little bit, like the team's not even on a run. You got to play smart basketball and make great plays to get us on a -- get our flow back, and I think in that third quarter, I got to the free-throw line. I think that helped us get going. Then we made some kickouts to the corner. Al got a three. We was able to get some good offense going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"But getting into that paint, being solid, being composed was what allowed us to push that lead back out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"We just said, just breathe. The game is starting now. Just breathe. We're in -- this is a moment where our experience shines through. Just breathe, just keep playing basketball. If you got a shot that's open, take it with confidence, no turnovers, take care of the basketball and just play our game. We got to get some stops. They made some big shots. Just navigate the run. That was it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Two great additions between Kristaps and Jrue. In any given night it could be any of us. And Kristaps had a monster game for us and just his presence shooting the ball and then him being able to attack those switches and mismatches, he made 'em pay every time, and that's what we need going forward in the series. Kristaps was big, but those other guys, Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, JT, they all can get going at any point in time, so that's the beauty of our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Every game has its own story. We just got to stay ready, stay composed, and take it one game at a time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yes, I think Kristaps has been great for us all season long. I think he's a big reason why we've been the best team in basketball record-wise, at least, and having him back and him playing well and to that level he was during the season is so important for us because you got another defender, another shooter, out there that you have to respect. So that just opens it up for everybody else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Now, next game, I'm sure they will make adjustments. We got to be able to read it on the fly and make plays. Guys got to step up. We need guys like Sam, Payton, to come in and step up, JT. Everybody got to be ready to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,It means nothing. You just get ready for the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just trying to get to the paint. You know, get paint threats. That creates openness for our shooters. Just get to the throw free-throw line, take my time, and knock 'em down, and clean it up for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"But overall, that's what I've been doing all season long, is just getting to the paint, and that just opens up -- that puts a lot of pressure on the defense. We got a lot of guys that can shoot the ball. Making those reads and stuff is big for us, so got to continue to maintain that throughout the season, throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"It was amazing. Nobody's more proud and more excited for him than I am. But we got to get better, we got to, you know, almost forget about it and get ready for the next one. We can't be celebrating ourselves. Dallas is probably getting ready for the next game right now, so we got to prepare and get ready for the next one, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, they complement each other very well. They are both three-level scorers. They can both use the pick-and-roll. One setting it, one coming off of it, vice versa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me. But to my teammates and the fans there, they're getting a big-time player and even better person. Just somebody who is going to bring it every day, push the people around me. Just someone that is going to work hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really proud of what our owners -- this is something, the owners actually appoint and pay the coaches, that our owners have stepped up to do. I think it's something we have our eye on, we had our eye on as soon as I came into the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sport is something that always in Serbia was something that put in front of us everybody, even like 10, 20 years ago, whatever, but now when we have Djokovic who won, probably the best ever. For us he's the best ever of course, and now we have our NBA championship, and I think it's a really good moment to be a Serbian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,It's like four or five.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day. Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career. I'm not worried about this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think as a group, I think we've found ways that we've gotten great looks. I think we've found a little bit of a rhythm offensively. We haven't made all the shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,Also just taking our time and trying to get this win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the moment, it's us, our coaching staff, our players. But this was for all Nuggets. That was what was really cool about it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I wouldn't say that it was a lineup change. I get what you're saying. We just went back to our original lineup. We went with this lineup for 14 games. I didn't have the foresight, I didn't. That's on me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I've heard that. Yeah, I don't know. Just my father's last name, as well. I don't know. I guess I've got like H's in my family or something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just an amazing duo. They've been together for the longest, and just how comfortable they are with each other and how they know each other's tendencies and what works for them and us as a team. It was just truly amazing to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"That's three 6'9"", 6'10"", 6'11"" guys who can dribble, pass and shoot, have high II think that's going to be a huge advantage for us and a struggle for other teams to game plan for."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"Yeah, super, super looking forward to it. Super excited about, just playing in the league in general. Just super excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, we have player personnel sheets and booklets essentially that we can go through and study players' tendencies, what their strengths are, what they like to get to, how they're most effective. Then I just kind of go through that, treat it like a Bible for the next couple of days and just stick to the script."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"For sure. It's something I take pride in, the defensive end. Having that opportunity, having that role, is something I'm really looking forward to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I think it's a standard that we hold ourselves to and that we have held ourselves to all year long. We've been building habits day in and day out. So, you get to a game like this, the biggest stage in basketball, you let your standard of play and you let your habits carry you."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I had a feeling from the information I was being told is that it was just kind of up in the air. Orlando wasn't really sure yet, and just to be ready for whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, to be honest, it's something that -- since year one, whoever was kind of speaking my language or I'm trying to kind of stay in touch or whatever, some guys maybe a little bit more, some guys a little bit less, but I'm trying to stay in touch with everybody."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, I think I knew the Fever were interested, but you never know until draft night obviously happens. I wasn't getting my hopes up or anything like that. Was just keeping an open mind."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We decided that given that investigation was ongoing and it remains ongoing, that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to work in these Finals. I don't know what the ultimate conclusion will be. We'll see where the facts take us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, I think that's -- Nikola never tries to impose his will or force things that aren't there. He's going to read the game. He's going to make the right play. Most importantly he's going to make every one of his teammates better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I think defensively he is definitely one of the best defenders out there. I credit that to his IQ but also his activeness with his hands.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think it's an opportunity to learn. You watch the film, go to school on it, try to take away some things that you did well, and then certainly learn from some things that you can do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, it seems like they've prioritized that, just maybe helping a little bit less on drives and staying home a little bit more. So it's an adjustment. It's something that we're used to and we feel like we can still generate good three-point looks. It's just going to be a matter of running good, crisp offense with pace, full court and half court, and then just playing to our strengths."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I really haven't thought about free agency at all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, there's lots of moments, kind of when there's a pause in the action, I guess, if you will, to kind of step back and be appreciative of the journey. When you're in it throughout the day to day, you're just focused on what's next. Obviously your perspective shifts and changes as you advance in your career and you want more for yourself, because we're all competitive people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Sometimes a dream is deferred, and our dream was deferred for a few years, but we stuck with it, and we added the right pieces. Huge shoutout to Calvin Booth and the job he's done. This is just an unbelievable feeling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,P-Wat has a great feel for the game and a chance to be a really great player for this team and to help this team along the way. I'm excited for P-Wat and the experience that he has gathered thus far.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Just enjoying and embracing this moment, I think that was the biggest lesson. I feel like I truly embraced it. I was very excited just to see my name pop up. It didn't matter if it was first round, second round. I'm just excited to be here. I know they're going to be always around me. I'm always going to be part of the Huskies family. I can always go talk to coaches, call them whenever, even the alums. It's just a big family. So it's nice to have them as my support group that I can always go to and ask questions about the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, when you play a team numerous times in a row, you've got to know what's coming. They know what we're doing, we know what they're doing. We're going to keep adjusting, mixing things up, but everybody is -- he's locked in. KCP is -- it's a defensive game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Not too much. The main focus through this pre-draft process was everything on the court. That's what it's always going to be for me, just keeping the main thing the main thing. But obviously there's stuff to talk about off the court. So later on the road, obviously. But as of now, I'm excited to get out there tomorrow. I can't really put into words how I'm really feeling about it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Tim Connelly hired me and brought me to the table here, and my countless conversations in my seven years with Tim, we would always talk about how we had the luxury of working for a group with Stan and Josh and the Kroenke family that is not going to be just a quick trigger. We have to make a move. We have to make a move. They were willing to take a step back and see this thing through."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and all of our head and assistant coaches, I'd like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, John Hareas, Mike Levine, Mark Broussard and so many people at the NBA, and for all the league support and assistance in providing this tremendous platform for our great coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Everything, man. We were there I think for five days. We saw Christ the Redeemer, we went to different beaches, different places to eat, as well as seeing all the basketball fans over there and how the game has grown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"So really excited to be drafted, excited to get to Dallas and get into training camp."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Las Vegas tell us that we were underdog before. That doesn't... It's not correct, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,The day I walked through the doors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Nah. I had one of my high school teammates who played for the Heat at the time, so I saw him a lot. But other than that, no."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with. So I'm fortunate enough to be able to be the one right now that's in the limelight, to be able to represent our area the best I can, and I look forward to being able to represent Miami, as well, and trying to get this title."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well."
