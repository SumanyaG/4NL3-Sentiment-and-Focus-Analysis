2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I started off just being an athletic girl, wanting to play hard, run around. Had a high motor. That kind of took me pretty far. I realized that that was something that was going to get me on the court, doing those little things, taking charges. Then once I got to high school, my coach told me if you can guard multiple positions, you know you're going to play. So I think I carried that with me all the time. As I got into college, I started to watch film. I started to watch my opponents and learn different defensive schemes and all that stuff. It's been a journey, but it's been a great journey."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I actually am from New York, so I used to go to Liberty games growing up. I was a ball girl a couple times. I've been around the W for a little bit. So being able to purchase tickets to sit front row, seeing that, they were giving out free tickets at one point for girls to come in and just have a crowd. To now playing against Iowa and selling out our crowd at home, just to see that evolution and that aspect, and now I haven't been to that many, but I think I went to one of the playoff games with the Liberty last year. So just to see that in itself, being a young girl, thinking that the stadium was so huge to coming in there going, you've played in stadiums like this but now it's filled up, it's filled to the top, I think it's great to show people that once you invest in women that they can give back in a lot of ways."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't. I did not envision this, not because I didn't think I was capable but because I didn't know. I think honestly until I was in maybe about ninth grade, my freshman year of high school, I had to learn the path that it took to get to the W. I was around it, but I didn't know the path that it took to get there. Once I learned that these colleges come and you get a free education and you get to experience so many different things -- I've had the opportunity to play on USA teams. So just for me, just understanding everything that comes with it. I didn't expect to be here, but I'm here, and I am so excited that Indiana has taken the opportunity on me. I played with Caitlin when I was at USA for a couple years. So we played together there. But from going against her this year to being able to play with her and also Aliyah Boston, as well, it brings me some comfort, honestly. Very excited and so proud of what they've done and how they've grown, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, it was definitely a tough decision for me last year, but I told people that I would never trade the decision I made to go to Ohio State. I think it has brought me so much peace in who I have become as a player and the impact that I can make in any program that I choose or organization that I have the opportunity to be a part of. So just having that mindset and going into Ohio State and coming in and realizing that I can make a little impact, I'm not here to change anything, but I'm just here to sprinkle a little of me in there and try to impact in any way that I can is really helpful. Then yeah, playing with Caitlin now is honestly really cool. We've had the opportunity, like I said, to have that sold-out crowd at our place and then going to her place and having that last regular-season home game for them. Just having the opportunity to play with her again, it's going to be amazing. She's done so much for the women's game, and I know she has so much more to give to everyone. Just a lot of excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously adaptability is definitely a big thing, being able to go to a different country, adapt to the environment, adapt to the culture. Overseas is definitely a different way to play ball. They play ball pretty differently there. Just having that prior experience. I know there are a lot of people in the W that are from overseas. So just having that prior experience, even playing with the caliber of players that I played with, I think all in all, everything together has helped me become the player I am today. I'm very hopeful and very confident that it will help me in the W."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I think pro level of play would probably be the best one. It's just pretty different. They're used to playing against grown women. They're used to that physicality. I think all together it has helped me in many facets of the game of basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's really focused on trying to make the team. Obviously that's the first step going into it, and having confidence in myself and trying to make that. If I do, and when I do get the opportunity to play against them, I think it's just going to be such a surreal feeling. I'm there to compete. I'm there to try to make a roster spot. I'm trying to stay in the league. I think a lot of it is just excitement, surreal, because I've seen them play. I was younger watching them play. But definitely very competitive and just excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously very, very big defensive-minded kid, but at the same time, I'm willing to do whatever it is that a team needs me to do. I'm willing to come in there and impact. I'm really big on community. So just getting my hand in the community and continuing to be who I am and continuing to make an impact in every stop that I've had."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I didn't have the opportunity to really, really get to know her. When I was recruited by Ohio State coming out of high school, she was there. So I got to see her on my visits a couple times. That was probably the biggest interaction. But very hands on, very big about coming to be a Buckeye. I think it's kind of interesting that that was the school that I was looking at coming out of high school. I ended up finishing my college career there, and now I get to play with a Buckeye. I think that's also going to give me some comfortability. She's a great player and so much I can learn from her. I'm just ready to go in there to work and continue to learn."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's special. I think taking that fifth year was something I thought long and hard about and I'm glad I did. A lot of good things came from it. Obviously having Emmy next to me it makes everything easier and that much more special. She's had a huge impact on me and everyone at Ohio State, and it's been really cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"She's everything to me. She's my why. She's why I do it, why me and my brother work so hard at it. She's special, and I really hope so. I know it'll be a little harder for them to travel, but I feel like absolutely they'll make it to some games."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's a surreal moment because I grew up as a little kid watching all these women play and how talented they are and being able to have a chance to play with them and compete against them, it's a dream. It's what we all are here for, and it's what we're looking forward to. I'm excited. I've seen the growth. Everyone has seen the growth, and to be a part of that is something that is really rare, so I'm looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Absolutely. I think that's something that's really big in today's world, especially with our class. It's exciting just to have those opportunities as women athletes. I think that's something that is kind of new to us, and it's exciting and it's absolutely something people should take advantage of. To be honest, I'm just ready to go play ball down there right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I think there's going to be an adjustment period for all of us, whether people want to admit it or not. I'm looking forward to it and welcoming it. As a rookie I think that's something you have to accept and be ready for. The pace, the length, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of things that are a little different and it'll take some time to get used to, but I'm welcoming that challenge and looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot. I've gotten to spend some time with some vets the past couple days and they've been really helpful. Just staying confident with who you are and what you do well is something that I took from them just a couple days ago. But I think that's important because when you're good at something, you can excel in that area and really keying in on that and taking that with you to the next level is definitely something I'll take from them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"I'm excited to play with everyone, to be honest on that team. Like I said, I grew up watching them, and I think being able to play with them now and getting that opportunity is something that, like I said, was a dream. They're a really talented group, and I know they're going to push me day one when I get there, so I'm excited for that. Competing really against everyone. The league is -- the talent, you guys have seen it and it's no joke and it's something I'm looking forward to and excited for, and like I said, there will be an adjustment, but I'm super excited."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I was there for a minute and I got to experience Buckeye Nation and just staying in Ohio, which was amazing. I think just the way we represented that university and the way they're going to continue to, it's an honor to put on that jersey every day, it's an honor to play in front of Buckeye Nation every night. I just hope that we left a legacy of hard work going out there every night and giving it our all. As far as representing the university and our fans, I hope we made them proud."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"My conversations were great with T Spoon. As you know, she was coached by Coach Mulkey, so I kind of thought maybe I'll go there. Knowing like the conversations were so good and she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a Black woman and as a head coach, and everything she's done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table. Jeff Pagliocca, the GM, was amazing, too, and player development is something that I was looking for and they looked for in me. I'm super excited for this move, and I'm just looking forward to getting to Chicago."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"My first time playing Kamilla was on one of the biggest stages in my life, when she played for Hamilton Heights and I played for St. Frances in high school and we battled. Now being able to be teammates is going to be amazing. I actually talked to her earlier, was congratulating her. I know she came off an amazing run, an amazing college career. I'm looking forward to playing with her in practice and in games, just bouncing off of each other. So I'm excited for this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by. I don't know. I don't know what movie right now. I don't know what movie right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Ooh, summertime Chi-town. To be cute on and off the court. I've always been to Chicago. The shopping is great. Just the lifestyle. I'm excited. I feel like I'm a Chi-town girl."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,Something Megan Thee Stallion. I love Megan Thee Stallion. Megan Thee Stallion or Beyonce.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"I have had so many people reach out to me from so many different places. Understanding our impact isn't just within our school, within just the U.S., but it's worldwide. It's amazing to see. Going out of the country when we go out of the country with my team, with LSU, it was like so much fun because they all recognized us and they knew us and it felt like home. I feel like anywhere we all go, and this draft class is amazing, anywhere we go, we're known. This is super cool because women aren't usually recognized around the world like how we are, and it's not even just basketball. It's the impact we've left on people's lives outside of there. It's super cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"I think our duo, me and Kamilla versus Cam and Rickea is going to be cool to see. That's going to be fun."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Just be you. A lot of people may just tell you that you can't do certain things, and you're going to get more yeses and nos, and I had to realize that. Just being able to be authentic, and people love me because of who I am. I had those tough conversations. I say things that a lot of people are scared to say, and take that scary step. I took a scary step of faith going to LSU, not knowing what could happen, and look how my life has completely changed. Being able to just believe in yourself, trust in yourself and have an amazing team behind me is great."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"I mean, I didn't know what I was going to do. Obviously coming back would have been amazing for me, but I wanted more for myself. I wanted to start over. I feel like I had been at a high since the National Championship, and I want to hit rock bottom. I want to be a rookie again. I want to be knocked down by vets, and I want to be able to get up and grow and be a sponge. I'm just super excited to play with the amazing players and against amazing players. This league is really competitive and I'm a competitive player, so I want to play against a lot of great players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Well, my mom was crying before the show even started, so it started there. Then my brother was like agitating me, I bet you 100 that you cry, I bet you 100 that you cry. He kind of got me, too. And I had a great conversation, like she was saying, with Chicago, so I kind of knew -- if it wasn't the Mystics, I knew it was going to be Chicago that was going to be calling me home."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"It means everything. I mean, like I said, on and off the court, we're amazing. We're not just basketball players, we're super impactful to the community, the people around us, the little kids that look up to us, and being able to also be nationwide, everybody knows us everywhere we go. Our lives aren't normal. We might get a little bit of normalcy going into the league now, but I'm just excited to be a trailblazer. I'm excited to be a part of history, and just continue to see the future, and I know it's bright."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, it's huge. Obviously traveling from the other side of the world or from Australia, it's a lot. Like I'm still jet-lagged and everything. I've still got emotions running through and I can barely sleep. But it's great. It's great to just look back, knowing that my country back home, my family and my friends they're all proud of me and they're all supporting me, watching me, especially my mom. She's done so much for me, my family and stuff, making sacrifices for us. Growing up I didn't come from a big basketball sporty world, and just played it because I loved it and my siblings played it, and then to get where I am now, it's incredible."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"Obviously being in Australia, it's a bit difficult to watch the games and get to it and stuff, but I think as the years progressed, we started getting to know the game a bit more and obviously it's like a little sisterhood. We've got the WNBL now on our side and we've got the WNBA, so you get to know about it. And we've got Australians and grads that play in the WNBA, as well, so then you get to study that, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, well, growing up in juniors, I'd always be the scorer, attacking the rim, being an offensive player and stuff. But as I headed into the pro league, being young, there's already people doing all that. You have to make sacrifices. You need to learn the game a bit more, learn your other strengths. For me, it was defense. My length, being able to guard different positions, different players, being able to switch on to different people and just using my length, my ability, my quickness to kind of get around people. For me, I think when I play defense and I play great defense, it brings my offense naturally. So it's like, it just comes to me, and I don't have to force anything. So that's probably why I do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm very excited. Obviously playing in a different league and then coming into another one is great. The lifestyle, the people you play against, what we learn in the game here is obviously a bit different, so getting to learn that, playing against people, taking things from them, what I can add into my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"All of them. All the WNBA players. It's so different back home. Again, like in the WBNL we do have imports that come and play, we had Tiffany Mitchell, Jordin Canada and being able to play against them and with them is huge, no matter whether they're guards or bigs, just playing against all of them and seeing the differences in how they all play and just -- yeah."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's amazing. Like I haven't been there before, but stories, everything I've heard about it, we've got fellow Aussies over there, as well. We've got Paul Goriss that's also there, as well, and he's been good to me, as well. He's talked to me then and there. He's been texting me and stuff, and Kristy Wallace. She's amazing, as well, on the court and off the court, as well. But I think just getting to know everyone, getting the experience, the new lifestyle and just -- as well as the coaches and the staff and everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's cool. It's amazing seeing fellow Australians in the WNBA, and they're achieving what you're achieving, as well. It's a privilege, honestly. It's such a great thing, and it's like -- I feel like it's just good that people can look at it and be like, wow, these Australians can play because I feel like that's one thing we don't really get sometimes, and we've had people like Lauren Jackson providing that for us. I hope one day we can leave that kind of legacy to younger kids and everyone, as well, in this generation, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm not really having any expectations. Just going in there with an open mind, making sacrifices. It's going to be hard. I'm young. They're great professional players, talented athletes. It's going to be hard, and I'm coming from a different country, different environment and a new lifestyle. Just taking it day by day, learning experience, talking to the vets, talking to everyone around there and just building that on to my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"I think it's great because I could do both, and either spot they need me to play that I could just sharpen in that area and get really good and just excel."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that. I think that I just bring versatility and just a physicality to the game of basketball, and so that's what mostly they'll be seeing from me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think just my teammates and how much time we spent together. I think that's something I'll miss, all the memories and things like that. Definitely the community in Salt Lake City. I think it's really grown on me the last two years I was there, and I'm going to miss it a lot because even though I came from another Pac-12 school, they still took me with open arms and just supported me throughout everything. I'm just looking forward to just starting this new journey and hopefully having a great rookie season."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Just that I'm a humble person and somebody who is really for the community and just loves to represent my people. I think I just especially this year just try to tap into representing my culture and just being that inspiration for young kids who look like me and are of my same background. I just think that impact is something that I'll carry with me to the WNBA, and I just hope that's what people see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I have a little bit. Gianna and Jenna have talked about Minnesota a lot and just how it is a very basketball-oriented state, and there's been so much rich culture of that there. So I'm excited to see it and experience it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think they'll just get somebody who's a competitor and somebody who has a unique style of play and is just fun to watch. I'm very excited to just be able to play at the next stage and kind of just improve in areas that I need to to really excel at the next level."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, growing up in Alaska was great. I would say I loved my childhood. It was just so much fun, camping, fishing, doing a bunch of outdoor stuff, and it's a beautiful state. The only problem I think was just the isolation it had from the rest of the world, and how much it lacked exposure and just sports and things like that. But I wouldn't have had it any other way. I loved my state and carry that with a lot of pride. I know going to Minnesota the cold probably won't bother me since I'm used to that, but I'm excited to be in a new environment and place. The football question, that's just played a big part in my life, I think, just kind of building up the physicality I played with. It's helped me a lot with that. Just having an older brother, he plays for the Dolphins now, just kind of looking back on it, how we were literally on the same team and competing against each other, it's cool to see. We're both very fortunate to be doing what we love at the highest level, and it's just a blessing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, first, I'm super excited to be drafted to Phoenix. I know they have some really amazing players there. But yeah, I think I'm super motivated. Obviously since being a kid I've always wanted to play in the WNBA. To have this opportunity means the absolute world to me, and I'm just excited to go out to Phoenix and get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I'll definitely miss the people. I love my teammates, my coaches and the staff around there, and them helping me so much. I know that in the dub I'll be a little bit more independent, so I'll probably miss the extra help of people telling me what to do. But I'm excited for what's next. I know at some point I have to grow up, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think it really was. I think I learned so much about myself as a player and especially as a leader. We had a really young team this past year, and I felt like I was able to grow my game and my leadership. I loved playing with my teammates and they always challenged me to be better, but I definitely think any leadership. I used to be so shy as a kid, so to see where I am now, I'm just so proud of that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I'm so excited to learn from both of them. Obviously they have a lot of great guards there, and Diana Taurasi is like the GOAT of basketball, so to be able to learn from her is going to be so fun and I can't wait for that. Natasha Cloud, I love her energy. I love when she used to play for Mystics and she was so fun to watch. It's kind of unreal to be able to say that like I'm going to be teammates with Diana Taurasi and Natasha Cloud."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think going in the third round, that's just a number, and I think I'm just going to go out there and do my best and show what I can. I'm really confident in my skills and my abilities. Obviously, I've earned this moment to be here. So I think, like I said, that's just a number, and I'll go out there and try my hardest and make the team."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,All the flavors tonight. All the flavors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I think I was just nervous the entire night, so the feelings didn't really change. I was pretty much nervous. But I know when I heard my name, I was just so excited, and I can't wait to get to work in Phoenix."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"I mean, if you saw my face, I don't think anything was going through my head at the moment. I was so positively overwhelmed, and just having all of them around me, all my people in the stands, at the table, knowing that my family, my friends from back home are watching, it's surreal. It's why I'm here. Without them, I would never be here sitting and answering your questions. I owe everything to them, and I'm just truly blessed and so grateful for Seattle to give me this opportunity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Thank you for your question. I love Sue. I love her so much. I remember watching her when I was a kid, trying to mimic her moves. Being at UConn after her has been a huge deal for me. Very, very humbling experience. She's one of the greatest. To be able to have this opportunity again, I mean, it's a full-circle moment for me. I can't believe it. It's got to be some higher power, something else going on, because I have no words for this. It's a full-circle moment for me, and I'm just so blessed. I honestly have no idea about the jersey number. That's honestly the least thing on my mind. That's not what I'm thinking about, but when I find out, I'll find you and tell you first."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. I feel like going back to when I had to make my college decision, UConn was a challenge, especially coming in with my class, Paige Bueckers, No. 1 player in the country, that was a huge challenge, but I took it. I feel like it paid off, and that's one decision that I'm so happy and proud that I made in my life because all of that led to this. But to get back to your question, I feel like first and foremost, I obviously -- their roster, just looking at it, those are some iconic women. Those are some iconic basketball players, people that I want to learn from, that I want to listen to, that I want to get challenged by, that I want to get yelled at, everything, all of the above. I'm ready for it, and I feel like it's kind of like a similar thing for me going to UConn and going to this place. Obviously, this is the next level. But I feel the same. I feel eager to learn. I feel eager to be challenged and eager to fail and rise up, and I feel like that coaching staff and that team will do it for me. The one thing that I want to bring is being a good teammate. I want to create amazing relationships over there. I feel like that's what makes and helps teams win, and I want to be a part of that winning program because it truly is a historic winning program."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Well, first and foremost, I feel like this was something that I didn't even dare to dream about, if I can say it that way. I always felt like it was such a reach. It was something far more beyond me and bigger than me. But luckily I had people around me, my teammates, my friends, my family, my coaches, everybody that made me believe in it, too. I always trust my work ethic. I feel like that's my best asset, how hard I work, how I don't give up, how I learn from my mistakes. Obviously I'm going to fail, and that's fine. But it's how you react to it. I'm ready for all the challenges. I'm ready for whatever is thrown my way. But I know I'm going to respond in a positive way and how a true competitor does."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. Thank you for the question. I feel like as you grow, you learn and you mature. When I came in as a freshman, I didn't understand that you don't have to be in the gym all day. It's how hard you work for those 45 minutes, those 20 minutes, and how consistent you are with it. I feel how my coaching staff, especially Morgan Valley, my coach, she kind of helped me guide me through that. This last, my senior year, I spent 25 minutes before every single practice, even on the days that I didn't feel like it, even on the days that I was tired, and shot threes and shot mid-ranges. That 40 percent that you mentioned is purely the testament to my hard work and dedication and her being in that gym with me every time. I'm so grateful to her. But I'm also very proud of myself and how I just remained consistent and proved to myself that consistency is the key, because hard work I already have it. Consistency was the key for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Yes, thank you. I feel like us UConn players, we're a family. It doesn't matter if we played 30, 20, 10 years ago or even before that, or you're playing right now or you are going to play in the future. Everybody is connected. That's what the coaching staff does a great job of, creating that family atmosphere, that strong bond and connection that lasts forever. That's how it is with Sue. She's been over to UConn so many times, whether that's like fun stuff or coming to watch our games or trying to help us and guide us and give us advice, because we all truly look up to her a lot. I mean, I'll say it again, it's a full-circle moment for me. All the things that kind of led up to this, it's crazy. I can't believe it. But I'm just super grateful and I can't wait to see her. I'm sure she's going to be of a great help, and my mentor and somebody that's going to guide me, and I want that. But to get back to your other question. Absolutely, Nneka, Skylar, those women are incredible, on and off the court. I can't wait to learn from them, and of course I watched them. Skylar, I watched her so much. Nneka, I mean, she hugged me and I almost passed out over there. And obviously the rest of the team. When you look at the names, what they've done -- I always go back to not just on the court but off the court with the influence that they have. I can't wait to be a part of that. I can't wait to learn. I can't wait to just listen and sit back and try to get everything I can from such influential, iconic women. I'm super, super excited. I can't wait to meet all of them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, I mean, that's a funny question because growing up, I didn't really have the opportunity to watch WNBA games. Even now in Croatia, people have to find their ways to watch those games. I feel like what I remember, I would sit in my living room with YouTube and find games or highlights or anything that I can. I remember watching Brittney Griner in my living room. It's just those little things that stick with me. But it was hard to find places and ways to watch these women. I feel like seeing now especially with this draft class that I'm a part of, amazing athletes, amazing people that brought women's basketball to another level, and I always say, all the players before us that paved the way for us, they deserve their flowers, and they deserve to be recognized. I feel like we're moving toward that direction, and I never think it's too late. I always think there's time to be better and improve and grow, and I feel like we're on the right track."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, Aaliyah has been there from the start. That's my sister. That's my family. I met her even before we both committed to UConn. Can you guys believe how full circle -- it's so many full-circle moments I can't even fathom right now. We met before at NBA Academy, BWB, and I loved her instantly. Our bond is strong. We don't need no words. You can feel it. You can feel the energy. To be able to here with her and share this has been nothing but incredible, and something that I'll remember for the rest of my life because it would not be the same if she wasn't here with me. I'm so proud of her. She's going to do amazing. She's going to do great. Everything that she did, she deserves. She put her head down and she worked. Even without all the recognition that she did deserve but she didn't get at times, she didn't care. She put her head down and she knew that something great will happen, and it did tonight. I'm so happy for her. But to get back to the other question, Paige, Azzi, Aubrey, Caroline, all my teammates watching at home, I love them so much. I owe them everything, and I can't wait for my younger teammates and everybody that's coming back next year to have this moment, too, because I know they will. I'll be proudly watching and cheering for them, too. I'm just so grateful to be able to call them my sisters and my family and have such great support even though I'm not home. This is my home away from home. They are my home away from home."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NIKA MUHL,"Yes, absolutely. I feel like I couldn't get more prepared than being at UConn, surrounded by all the coaches, but especially Coach. He's just a legend. When UConn called, I couldn't say no. That was the opportunity of a lifetime for me. Every single thing in that culture that he built in that program aligns with me and who I am as a person and who I strive to be and get better at being. But just the things I went through with him is so much, and he's my best friend. He's not just my coach, he's my best friend. He's been there from the start. When I failed, through the worst things, through the best things, he always stuck by my side and never left. I'll cherish that bond and that relationship that I have with him forever. I'm so grateful and happy that he was there tonight, along with all my coaches, at the table and in the audience. They prepared me. They pushed me. They cussed me out when they had to. They yelled at me when they had to. They praised me when they had to. They just did everything right. So grateful because not just as a basketball player they have changed me, but they changed who I am as a person. They made me a better person and they make me want to be even better. I'm grateful for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I think my emotions have been so up and down over the last six weeks. I had different expectations in February than I did at the end of March. I think I've been dealt with what I've been dealt with, and the only way to really move on is to have a positive outlook. Honestly, I'm so excited for the fit. I'm really excited for Vegas. I think that's really promising. To be able to learn from the people at Vegas for the next year, what more could you ask for? If I'm not able to play on the court, I know that I'll be able to benefit mentally and emotionally just by observing what they have there. I'm really excited, and that's my No. 1 emotion right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Well, they're always there for me, first of all, no matter if I go out and have 25 in a game or if I can't play. I know they're going to be at the game. They're going to be the first ones hugging me afterward. That support has meant the world to me over the last 15 years that I've been playing basketball or sports at all. For them to be able to be here with me on draft night, my family, my sister, my parents, it means everything to me. It's not just a testament to what I've been able to do but how they've been able to help me get here."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I didn't start playing basketball super seriously until probably middle of high school, so I wasn't exposed to it super early. But I also think the media didn't push it as much. Even though I played basketball in high school, it wasn't necessarily something that was super popular in the media. But I'm super excited for it to be taking that trajectory. The class that I'm in right now has done an incredible job to bringing attention to women's sports, women's basketball, and now taking it into this league I think is super exciting. I think we're already seeing the impact of that on little girls. I think they're way more aware of it than I was at that age, and that's super exciting. I think with expansion coming up and all that stuff, it's headed toward a really good place. I'm really excited to be a part of it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, honestly I'm thrilled. I can't think of a better situation to be in with the situation that my leg is in, because it's just an incredible fit. I think their resources are amazing, their facilities are awesome. To be able to look up to the players there, to be able to watch A'ja Wilson, even though I can't play, I know I'll be able to learn so much and get better just by watching and being around the culture that's there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"That means everything. Those five years at Virginia Tech were so, so special. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The people I had around there, the teammates, the coaches, they were just incredible. They made me who I was. For me to bring that attention to Virginia Tech, to take it to a Final Four, win ACC championships, was just so fun. For them to recognize me I think is really, really cool, but it's also just making me really proud of the program that we were able to create there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I was just able to talk to Coach Becky Hammon a little bit. Obviously there's a little bit more to be figured out, but she spoke about the medical staff there and just working on getting me out there, so we can see where I am and start taking those steps to get me back on the court again because obviously that's the ultimate goal. But I'm super excited. I think seriously it's a great fit for all of those things. I know that they'll support me, and we'll all have the same goal of getting me healthy and helping to contribute. We'll take it day by day but with that in mind for next year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah. I mean, he's taught me everything I know. I didn't come into college expected to be anything really. I really didn't take basketball super, super seriously. I thought I wanted to play softball when I was little in college. He completely changed my perspective on that. He made me fall in love with the game to the point where you couldn't get the two of us out of the gym together. We just love spending time with each other in there. I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm looking into them pouring into me, and I'm doing the same on and off the court. I'm so excited to play with Cam. We're both competitive. We're young. We're feisty but we're still going to bring that game offensively and defensively. I know if I get beat off the dribble, Cam is swatting into the second row. So I'm ready for that, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm excited to bring my versatility, play at any position, taking advantage of whether it's a small guard on me or bigger or slower player. I'm excited about that. Then I just want to work on getting in tip-top shape after the injury. My conditioning was in the game trying to get back. I feel like when I'm in tip-top shape, world-class shape, that's when I'm playing my best both ends of the floor."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm definitely excited. I'm just grateful that L.A. believed in me. They see something in me, and I see something in them, too. I had great talks with them prior to the draft, so I'm just grateful for it all. Playing at Tennessee and Mississippi State, it's prepared me for this moment because life is just trials and tribulations, but how you get through those, and I feel like I've overcome a lot of adversity. I've continued to stay strong, and that's what got me to where I am today."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, it's crazy to say, but I didn't even think about how the draft process goes. I thought you just show up to draft day and you kind of get drafted. I didn't know if they even speak to you prior to the draft. Really crazy of me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'll answer your second question first. Definitely. This is generational class. I feel like this class is just so different. I know this class is different. I feel like the viewership is peaking. Women's basketball is on an uproar. Everybody is tuning in. We averaged better than the men this year. Not to say we're in competition, but that just says a lot. I'm grateful to be a part of this draft class. I feel like we're just trending in the right direction."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Probably the pace of the game. I feel like high school to college, it was a different pace, so I feel like it's probably going to be that same thing in the league, going up against the world's best players. I feel like that's going to be pretty tough. But I'm excited for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, to be in the conversation with those greats is so crazy and mind blowing to me. I'm just grateful to have Candace come to our games sometimes, have Tamika Catchings, have Jordan Horston in my ear, and they continue to support me. Jordan texted me how much she was proud of me, texted me a little bit about the process. Tamika and I speak every now and then. She's just always pouring into me. I just call her my big sister. Just to have that contact with a Tamika Catchings, it's like, whoa. She doesn't even know it, but when she came to our practice and she was acting like she knew me, you don't even know but I was over here like, girl, you're Tamika Catchings. That was pretty cool to experience, though."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"I would give her advice of just be true to who you are. Problems are going to come, challenges are going to come, but the way that you handle it is what builds character. I feel like there's always a light at the end of the tunnel and just continue to just push, push, push. If she plays basketball, I would say repetition is everything. Get the fundamentals down, just work on the little things before -- this generation is a little more flashy, but the fundamentals are everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, growing up I didn't like basketball at all. I just wanted to do girly stuff. I just wanted to be a ballerina and cheerleader. I didn't watch basketball growing up. But once I picked up a ball and I started to see how serious this could go, I really started tuning in a lot. I watched every WNBA basketball game. Even if I can't, I record it and then I'd go back and watch it. I don't look at the score because I like to feel like it's still live. I like that excitement. Just L.A. as a whole, I know they weren't where they wanted to be. Championships, everyone wants a championship. I feel like I'm just excited to be a part of this journey. I feel like we're going to be really good, just looking at the roster itself. I'm just excited. I've watched them play, so I'm kind of familiar of how they like to play, their style of play. So that's pretty cool, and I feel like I'm going to fit in really well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yes, I'm so excited to play with Zia. It's so full circle. We grew up knowing each other. We played AAU together. We live like an hour away from each other, but that's my best friend, so we're still really close. But I feel like basketball is just always bringing us back together in the craziest ways. We took our four visits together coming out of high school. I'm so excited to play with my girl. I feel like this is just going to reconnect us on that deep level again."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm honored, honestly, that she said something like that about Cam and I. I truly believe that, as well. I feel like what Cam and I bring is just foundational, like you said. I feel like we're willing to put in the work. We're willing to do whatever as rookies. So I feel like that's pretty, pretty good, and I'm just excited to get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"It played a big role, knowing that we have a few athletes that have already came out of there, and to be one of them means a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"To know that I'm going to such a special team with quite a few veterans means a lot. It's something like a perfect situation, I'm coming in to learn, and there's a lot to learn from, and like I said, there are a few vets on this squad. So to be able to walk into this situation is kind of perfect for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"The first thing I would say to them is don't allow anyone to dim your light, no matter your size. I've dealt with that all the way up until today, tonight. Other than that, I would say that no matter what happens, if you want to achieve something, you can do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"I want to learn from the vets as much as possible. I want to add a little bit of everything to my game. I want it to expand. I also want my IQ for the game to expand, as well. Yes, I can score the ball, but what else are you able to do? I think that with those guards over there, they're going to do a wonderful job of helping me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"I'm very excited. I think that it's a full-circle moment for me. I was nominated for that Becky Hammon point guard award, I believe, three seasons in a row when I was at Buffalo. For me to have not received it and to be drafted by her when the time was right has been a full-circle moment, so I'm ready, and I'm ready to go."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Good evening, everyone. It's great to see you all here. Welcome to the 2024 WNBA Draft presented by State Farm. This honestly is one of, I think, my favorite days of the year. We're thrilled to be at the famed Brooklyn Academy of Music for the first time. BAM is actually America's oldest performing arts center, hosting some of the brightest talents across a wide range of concentrations since 1861. Tonight, BAM hosts some of the brightest talents in basketball. You all may have noticed the fans coming in tonight, and I know some of you got held up. We apologize. But this is the first time the draft has had fans in attendance since 2016. Tickets sold out in under 30 minutes, and that was before the players declared for this draft. Just another illustration of the passion and excitement surrounding the WNBA right now. The next chapter in each player's basketball journey starts tonight. I have the ultimate honor of calling their names and seeing the excitement from them, their families, their friends and team representatives as they take the first step of their professional careers. This is just one ""Welcome to the W"" moment for this class. I spent time with them last night and earlier today at the Empire State Building, which will once again brighten up the skyline with WNBA orange tonight. This is a great group of young women. I also spent some time with their parents last night and today and with their families. I'm so excited to see what they will all bring to this league. Speaking of the 2024 draft class, I would be remiss not to mention the incredible excitement and energy for women's basketball that this group has helped build. Just last week, many of those here with us played in front of the largest broadcast audience in history The national championship peaked at 24 million viewers and was ESPN platforms most-viewed college basketball game, men's or women's, on record. Incredible. It's so clear that this draft class is entering the WNBA at an incredible time. We are witnessing a transformational moment in sports that we may not experience for generations. The business transformation -- I know you guys love when I talk about it -- that we've been working so hard at is showing results. Support for the WNBA is continuing to grow. Look at this room. Our sport has never been stronger on the court. I for one feel incredibly blessed to be part of it and to lead the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the United States that is leading the charge for women's sports. This is a league where -- you all know that cover us year-round -- the talent is exceptional, the rivalries are intense and where you tune in to watch a lot of games of consequence. We are ready for this moment. We're coming off a record-breaking season that saw the WNBA reach milestones in viewership, fan engagement, attendance, social media and digital engagement on the WNBA app and website. For the second year in a row, we'll be hosting a preseason game in Canada. This year, the L.A. Sparks and the Seattle Storm will face off at Rogers Place in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, on May 5. We air games in over 200 countries and territories. Games like our Canada game show how the league is continuing to expand its global footprint. The fourth annual Commissioner's Cup will return this time with a new format that we are very excited about. Just remember, this is our fourth annual. Each team will play five Commissioner's Cup games, one against each of its in-conference rivals, all during a two-week period at the beginning of June. The players will compete for a half-million-dollar prize pool, and the league will once again be donating to all of the teams' designated not-for-profit community organizations. This season in July we'll return to Phoenix for the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game, with the three-time WNBA champion Mercury hosting it for the third time. An even bigger and better WNBA Live fan experience will be back for a third straight year. We're excited for you all to see what we have in store at this year's All-Star Game festivities. Each year we are seeing more and more brands eager to partner with us. Our partners have shown that they have stepped up for the WNBA, and we are extremely thankful and fortunate to work with brands that are so excited to be a part of moving the league forward. We were just on stage with the State Farm executives who are here in full force as our presenting partner tonight. Over the past few weeks and months we've announced several partnerships, including with Opill, SKIMS, Peloton, La Crema, Tissot. I've got my Tissot watch on here. We've also renewed partnerships with brands, including Glossier and Amazon, and CBS as media partners. WNBA tip-off 2024 will again be presented by CarMax, which became a WNBA Changemaker, our elite category of our corporate partners, and our others are ATT, Deloitte, Google, Nike and U.S. Bank. They continue to help us change the game for these players. Our Changemaker partners are a significant driver of our growth, and we are very appreciative of all their support. We look forward to adding more, including another one to be announced as we tip off this season. Our partners are committed to supporting women's sports. We're seeing the work of our broadcast and streaming partners, especially ESPN and ABC. If you build it, they will come. We just proved that in March Madness, and we'll bring that into the WNBA season. We're bringing games to fans where they are, whether they're on national networks, ESPN, ABC, ION, which was our over-the-air partner that we signed last year, streaming on Amazon Prime, ESPN or on our own WNBA League Pass, which last year saw milestone growth for the league. And we're hoping to repeat that this year. The growth and demand for the WNBA had led us to expansion, something that I know you all want to hear about. I've been very excited, as you all know. We announced a team in the Bay Area, with the Golden State Warriors coming in the '25 season. So one year from today, they will be here making a pick. With more news to come in the coming weeks and months on other potential markets to join in 2026 and beyond. That brings me to women's basketball is not a fad. We've been steadily building this momentum for years, and we are ready for what's next. Lastly, I have been very reflective over the past couple weeks with all the hype and talk about this draft class and the WNBA. Surviving the existential time of the WNBA wubble, raising that 75 million in capital in February of 2022 as the first women's sports league to do so at that scale, deploying it against our key priorities. Almost as if we knew we had to be ready for this moment, and we are. With that, thank you again for all your support. To those that have covered us over time, we thank you for your coverage. And for those of you that are new, to quote from our ad campaign, welcome to the W. We hope you stay. The WNBA Draft will get started soon, and I'm happy to answer any questions. I really, again, appreciate the coverage. This is what helps grow our sport, and I know many of you have been with us a long time, through our 27th and soon to be 28th season, and we really do appreciate that. With that, we'll start our QA portion."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"I'll answer the latter first. As many of you know, we already announced that we are providing charter to our players through our full Playoffs, Commissioner's Cup and also the back-to-backs requiring air travel. Why that's important is this year there are a lot more back-to-backs requiring air travel because it's an Olympic year and we have an Olympic break. So we funded out of the league a 4 million fund to fund charter for this year. Again, as we build the momentum and build the economic model to fund that longer term, there's nobody that wants that more than I do for these players, but we have to be in the right financial position. We're not going to jeopardize the financial viability of this league. It was just a few years ago we were surviving, and now we're going from survive to thrive. So we'll do it at the appropriate time, and we've been chipping away at it every year and adding additional charter flights for the players. Media deal. So speaking of better travel, better pay and all that, sports, especially at league levels, you have two main revenue streams. One is your media rights, and the other is corporate partnerships. We've been really making great progress with the corporate partnership side. On the media side, I think women's media rights have been undervalued for so many years, just a microcosm by the way of the broader world that I came from before I came here. So I think it's really important that we're doing everything we can. This is an important year for us around viewership, around attendance, around all the qualitative and quantitative factors that go into the valuation of media rights, because as I've said to my team, there's not a day that we're not -- if we're not working on things that feed into the valuation of our next media rights, we're not focused on the right things. This is a really important focus for us. Our current deals go through the '25 season. So through October of '25. We do have some time, but we're gearing up for a combination of what that media rights package would look like. As you know, the media landscape continues to be enormously disrupted, with household and people using TV levels down, with obviously cord cutting, with streaming, with over-the-air. Obviously, there's a lot going on subscription-wise, cable. So we're looking at all of that disruption and determining what is the best deals with partners for the WNBA, including, again, traditional linear, streaming and over-the-air."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"So first, our plan and goal is to get to 16 teams in the next few years. We're at 13 with the Golden State team. Our plan is to get three more in the next few years. We're talking to a lot of different cities. I think I've thrown out names before. It's complex because you need arena and practice facility and player housing and all the things, you need committed long-term ownership groups. The nice thing is we're getting a lot of calls. We continue to engage with cities. I'll throw some of those out there because I've already thrown them out there. We continue to engage with cities like Philadelphia and Toronto, and Portland and Denver and Nashville and South Florida and probably forgetting one, but those are the cities we're talking to. But just last week we got calls from two other cities. These can either take a very long time to negotiate or can happen pretty quickly if you find the right ownership group with the right arena situation. We're on our way to 16. That will add 48 roster spots in just a couple of years. That, in a league of 144, is a lot. That's 30 percent. I think it'll be great when we get those done over the next couple years. '26 is definitely our goal for certainly the next one, and then shortly thereafter, if not then, or a year or two after. So by '28, I'd say I'd feel pretty confident we'll be at 16 teams. Expansion draft, again, we're not going to share exact details on the expansion draft today. But it'll happen this year, this calendar year, so probably in December because it has to happen before the college draft. That expansion draft, we'll share more details as we get closer to that. We've been talking with our general managers and head coaches and the teams and the owners, so more to come on that. But there will be an expansion draft this year, and it'll probably be in December."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think what's important is there's a reason the WNBA is the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the country, and it's because the NBA has been such a great partner in launching this league, building this league and investing in this league. So to the extent it makes sense, I think what I heard Adam say, but to the extent it made sense to go to market together, that's what we'll do. I think as you look at streamers who have a subscription model, the WNBA gives the NBA longer programming across the year. I think Adam uses the quote of 320 I actually think it's more days. And there's no other set of two sports leagues that can offer that live programming and sports to a streamer like that. I would say probably in that case we need the NBA because we have a smaller footprint with only 40 games, and it's nice to go to market together. So where it makes sense to go together, we will. Where it makes sense -- so we have our own deals today that the NBA doesn't have, with Amazon, with CBS and with ION. So where it makes sense not to, we'll evaluate that and work with Adam and his team on that. We're just excited that we have a lot of interest from a lot of media partners in the W. We've got to deliver an amazing season this year in order to get, I think, the right-sized valuation."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think everybody is watching those teams that are investing in the player experience. I'll call it more -- because it is more broad than just practice facility. There's a variety of things in player experience that can attract a player in free agency. And quite frankly, off of our 2020 very progressive and historic collective bargaining agreement, free agency opened up, as you've seen, some really interesting years of free agency that we didn't used to have. I think you see that investment. You'll see it pay off. I think there are other owners looking at the exact same thing. We have situations where, again, we have NBA-affiliated teams who already have great practice facilities. I think everybody is looking for an advantage to bring in free agents, because the one thing I know these long-term committed owners in the W are, they want to win a championship. I think practice facilities and other player experience have become very important as you seek free agents in the marketplace."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"See, we're a pretty good vault here at the WNBA. I'm not going to comment on any specific ownership group. We've had several ownership groups in several cities reach out to us. Sometimes in a city, two different ownership groups reach out. Again, we evaluate them through our process. We also evaluate the city, the demographic, the psychographic. That is my hometown, so I happen to know more about that. But we've done a big data exercise in research. No specific comment on that specific city other than it's certainly on the list. I think it's a great basketball city. We'll continue to discuss it with ownership groups there that are interested in committing long term to the W."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, the one thing in sports, at the league level we love to bring in these corporate partners because then they can support our players across all of our teams. We've been able to establish that with our current WNBA Changemakers and other partners that aren't Changemakers. We upsell to Changemakers, like we did with CarMax. They were a partner, not a Changemaker, and they came to us and said we want to support the W in a bigger way. So we were able to upsell them, too. There are some open categories we have in a variety of categories. That's how we target who we want to be partners. But we also look at a values match. We also look at -- relationships matter, too. If we have relationships with the CEO or the CMO or someone in the C-suite, that's an important part because then you can turn that into a corporate partnership. One of the things that's great about being in the WNBA right now is everybody is paying attention. I ran into someone who ran an ad buy during the final of the women's Final Four. They said -- it was a CEO they got thousands of messages, not only about how great they thought the ad was but that they ran it during women's basketball, and how much that lifted their brand with not just their female employees but their female customers and everybody."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, I think with eyes on the game increasing at historic levels, obviously betting is not legal in every state. Integrity is No. 1 for us, so obviously we do a lot in that area. But certainly from a perspective of bringing in a fan base that might not have been in the WNBA before. We've had plenty of betting on WNBA in past years, but obviously I think FanDuel or one of the betting companies released a statistic about that LSU-Iowa game in the Elite Eight, and it was one of the highest bet games they had seen. I hadn't seen the data post that for the Final Four and the final game, but I'm sure a lot of people are paying attention, transcending age, race, gender from that perspective. That's what these WNBA players coming into this Draft tonight are going to do for us, and I think the attention and the views and bringing in another part of a fan base that might not have watched women's basketball before and now are following these household names. The one thing I know about sports, you need household names, rivalries and games of consequence. Those are the three things we've had over the past couple weeks, and hopefully will continue into the WNBA season. Certainly sports betting is something that attracts fans in. I think we need to work on this idea of watch and bet versus bet and watch because if you bet, maybe you don't watch, but if you watch and then bet, yeah, then you're probably bringing in a fan base we haven't had before. Integrity first. Obviously, it's not legal in every state in the U.S.. But as we start to see that -- and betting partners are supporting our teams, as well, in corporate sponsorships. So I think again, it's an important way to grow our viewership."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that -- that's why I started to answer this question with the integrity of the game is No. 1. It will remain No. 1 no matter how the handles grow and things like that. But people are going to bet on our sport, and we do a ton of training from the league, the team perspective. The Players Association I know has a rules of the road around this. I think it is really important. I was actually talking to the players last night, and I said I learned one thing when I was the CEO of Deloitte about juggling four things in life your work, your health, your family and your integrity. I said, when you juggle those balls, three of those balls are glass and if you drop them, they break, and those are family, health and integrity. The work ball is rubber. You can mess up and recover. But those three balls, so the integrity I think it's really important that the players understand they're big brands with big followership, more than any players have had coming into the league because of the popularity of the women's game at the NCAA level, and how important is integrity. It's accomplished by training. Do I worry about things like that? Sure, and everybody should in sports. But I do think it's happening around us, and if we're not cognizant of what's going on and how that can benefit the viewership of the league and things like that, so we don't want to leave that on the table, but we want to do it in the right way with the right guardrails around integrity. We have not, to my knowledge, had issues on that, but we'll continue to monitor it for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, so obviously one of our focuses this year of our social justice council is reproductive rights, as well as civic engagement, given that we're in a general election year. So the one thing I like about our players, our players want to be engaged. They don't run away from things. They want to be engaged and they want to force change in the communities in which they live and work, and they do it very, very effectively. I think on this issue they'll continue to do that effectively. Obviously we have a team there, as well, and in other states, but they'll continue to make their impact on this particular issue, maternal health, reproductive rights. Actually, the charities that we'll be donating to as part of the Commissioner's Cup will be charities in that space, and the players, again, will use their voice because they know if they use their voice, change will happen for them. I think we'll just continue to obviously monitor. You're right, we decide on All-Stars now a year in advance. We're getting better at that. Therefore, we made this decision a year ago. We'll continue to monitor the situation there, but our players won't run away from it. They'll want to help change and effect change, and we'll use our platform and their platform to do just that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so it is great to actually inherit, I'll call it. Quite frankly, again, we didn't do what we did in the bubble in 2020 to have a season, which is existential for us, I'm not sure we're at this moment with these household names coming into our league, because there might have been nowhere to play had we been out of the sports landscape for 20 months. We certainly wouldn't have the momentum we all have in women's basketball and are enjoying. So I'm thrilled that we have household names coming in. We need to market around that. In fact, one of the things we did for the first time ever was we did a media ad buy from the Sweet 16 into the final for the WNBA. You might have seen them. I have a prop with me today. Rookie-O's. Arike was in one of the commercials and Stewie was in another, and we had another one predicting when the rookies come in. I thought it was clever, and Arike and Stewie did an amazing job. But this was an investment in bringing that NCAA viewer into the WNBA, and we hadn't done it before. I know just from my circles in life, hearing people who are all talking about the WNBA, that we're going to be successful in that. But it is about marketing, so deployment of that capital in the marketing area. We've increased our marketing budget significantly for this year to capture just that, and I think we're already seeing the returns on that. We had 98 percent positive sentiment on this ad campaign. I mean, that's the W. Ninety-eight percent positive. We're really excited about that. So those are the types of things, but we have a variety of other things. You might have seen some that were at the NBA All-Star Game, how we stood up activations there, and Sabrina-Steph in the three-point competition obviously was a highlight of that weekend. Just continuing to have our player marketing agreement players that we're paying in the offseason to market on behalf of the W. We've got Aliyah Boston here today doing a lot of -- she obviously did an amazing job, I thought, on broadcast during the NCAA Tournament, as well. We're trying a lot of different things now that we have some of that financial capital and human capital, because you need human capital, too, to grow. So we've been able to hire a lot of people in our marketing group, and we had very few when I came in. We have a Chief Marketing Officer now and we have the power of the NBA brand, too, helping us market. It's all shaping up to continue to take these household names and build new household names. I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, we continue to look at the data that comes through and where there's anomalies or unusual -- again, this year is going to be an unusual year overall because of our footprint with an Olympic break, about a three-week Olympic break. But I think next year we'll have a great footprint. We've continued to look at the data around injuries and the hardship system and things like that. We also continue to look at where the 10, 11, 12 players on our rosters fall as far as playing time and things like that. We'll continue to take a look at it. I think for now, the roster spots are going to remain at 12. But again, as I said, we're going to add 48 roster spots in probably a three-year period or so, and that's a lot. So we'll give a lot more -- I thought you were going to ask me because my goal is we have -- we need to give these players a lot more opportunities to play at the professional level, and that's what growth is. That's what's going to fund the growth, whether you talk about revenue, media deals, corporate partners, the more cities you're in. Again, longest-tenured league, 330 million people in this country, not enough to be in 12, so now we have 13, on our way to 16, and I think we can do even more after that. I think that's the way to add these roster spots for purposes of the game, as we've looked at the data. But we continue to monitor that for sure and talk with our players quite frankly about it, as well. Again, I just want to thank you all. Again, for those that are new to this league, watch, rep, buy, attend. It's an amazing game on the court, and I probably wouldn't have taken this job if it wasn't. I really appreciate all your support. Thank you. Enjoy tonight."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"For the first question, the moment, man, it was the moment for me. Right before the Commissioner said my name, I just looked down and thought to myself and said a little prayer, like it's your time, it's God's timing. She said my name, and that's when the water works started happening. Just super grateful for this moment and this opportunity. Your second question with Shakira, great player. Followed her from D-I all the way to the W. I think I'm just happy to really get the opportunity to play alongside her. Such a great player. I think that she's going to elevate me. I can elevate her, too. But whatever impact I can take for this team and to this organization."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Very rewarding, and I think one of the things going into this league that I want to do is just expand my game. Might be asked to play a different role, but I'm open to it. I see myself as a versatile player and impacting in any position that I'm asked to play in. Yeah, it's going to be a tough league, tough first year, but I'm pumped and I'm ready for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's been a lot. Long days, a lot of long days. But once I hit the weekend, once I was with my fellow draftees, that's when I started really sinking in the moment and just being appreciative for being a part of this. The W is the W, and it's a great league. I'm just super excited to be a part of it, but the process is no joke, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, just to have a dream like this and to actually walk through it, I said this out there, it's just amazing. A lot of people have dreams, but a lot of people aren't able to achieve it. For me to be fortunate enough to say that and to keep going and to keep pushing my dreams, it's just amazing. I would say my message for the younger girls is just be confident, be who you are, but know your worth. I mean, coming from Canada, wasn't given as many opportunities as, say, my fellow draftees, but I made the best out of it, and I earned everything that I was given. Stay humble but let them know."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's great. The Bleed Blue bleeds all the way into the league. I'm just very fortunate to be given the opportunity to go to UConn and spend my four years there, but especially spend my four years there with Nika. We had a hug when my name was called. It's just a lot because the people and the relationships you build over this beautiful game that we play, it's amazing, and to share this moment with her and Coach and CD Chris Dailey and J Jamelle Elliott and Mo Morgan Valley, and Paige and Azzi were in the audience, too, it's a family. I'm hoping to make a new family in D.C."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"It feels great. I feel like the platform that I was given, even though at first I wasn't really sure that I was able to step into it, but I've had to step into it. I've had to kind of live in my truth because I know that a lot of young girls are looking up to me and a lot of people who are inspired to be like me are watching. You're not only playing for yourself, you're playing for those following behind you, and you're also playing for those who laid the groundwork in front of you. Coming into the W, I respect that. I appreciate, I'm not going to say elders because I don't want them getting on me, but I appreciate our vets, and I'm going to soak up all the experience, but also knowing that I have a huge impact across the border in Canada and across the border in Asia, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say what excites me the most is coming into this Liberty team and learning from the vets that are there, and just going in and continuing to grow. I would say something that stood out to me is them looking basically for a two-way player and me being just that. So knowing that I can come in and be a two-way player and make an impact that way is something that I look forward to."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I approach being on a team like that, just coming in each and every day, just getting in the gym and putting in that work to be able to do what those expectations are and just coming in and being ready."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say that makes it a little bit easier. Just coming in and having a certain role and knowing what's expected of you and knowing that you don't have to be the superhero or anything like that. So I would say that that would definitely make it a lot better or -- well, yeah, coming in, learning from those vets."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I'm very excited to work with her and just learn from her and take whatever I can take from her and take it to my game. I would say just being able to score in different ways, that's a way that I can come in and help the Liberty."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is definitely my passing. I think that's at times what gets overlooked in my game. I think the scoring and the long shots is what everybody falls in love with. Then obviously going to an organization that has, in my eyes, one of the best post players in the entire world. My point guard eyes just light up at that. And obviously, Aliyah has been one of my teammates before. I'm excited. I can't wait."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, I don't really feel like I have a rival. I think the biggest thing is the WNBA is so competitive right now. Every single time you step on the floor, it's going to be a rivalry. I think so many teams are loaded with so much talent. This is the most competitive league in the entire world. Less than 144 spots. So you'd better bring it every single night, and I think that's exactly what I'm going to do. But I think that's exactly how I lived my college career, too, is every single game, no matter what the opponent was I prepped the exact same way, I prepared the same way, I brought the same fire, I brought the same energy. I think that's the biggest thing going into my WNBA career."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is I vividly remember Coach Bluder during my home visit in my recruiting. It was at the end of my junior year, I believe, or maybe the beginning of my junior year. Sometime during my junior year. I think the biggest thing is we talked about this moment, we dreamed of this moment, but she also believed I would be here and she coached me really hard to get to this moment. There was a lot of ups and downs. Something I really appreciated about Coach Bluder is no matter what awards or success or wins we ever had or I had, it's like she never stopped coaching me, she never stopped holding me accountable. She always thought there was ways for me to get better. She still thinks that, and I still think that. That's one of the things I just love about her. First of all, she believed I would be here from the day I committed to her, even before that when I was in eighth grade, but also she pushed me really hard to make me as good as I am."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Definitely Aliyah Boston. Come on now. I think also Erica Wheeler. A vet, somebody that has been in the league a long time, somebody that is in the organization, has been in the league, understands what it's about, somebody that I can lean on. I'm 22 years old, and I don't have all the answers in the world. This is something new to me. This is a new challenge. That's something I'm excited for. But having those type of people around me to lean on and ask questions, or when things get hard, to be there for me. I think those two, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think obviously the course of the last few weeks has been pretty insane in my life, the last two months playing basketball as long as I possibly could in my college career, and then went home for a couple days. I got off the plane when we landed in Iowa City, drove directly home, had cook my mom cook me a meal, and then I drove back to Iowa City the next day. We had our celebration, and then I flew to L.A., flew to New York and now I'm here sitting at this stage. I think the biggest thing is I'm just very lucky to be in this moment, and all these opportunities and these things, they're once in a lifetime. When things might get tiring or you have to do stuff, I think the biggest thing is look at it just as an opportunity. This isn't something everybody gets to do. It's once in a lifetime, and just trying to soak in every single experience because I know how quick of a turnaround it is, and I have a lot of people helping me. Then obviously Aliyah Boston, there's so much you can say about her. Rookie of the Year. In my eyes, one of the best players in the league. Like I said, as a point guard, my biggest job is I'm just feeding Aliyah the ball every single day. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be in there and be like, go make a layup. She's going to make my life easy. She's incredible. But the thing I love about her is she's a great person. She loves the game, she knows the game, she supports the game and she has a smile that affects a lot of people and brings a lot of joy to people when they watch her. I can't wait to be her teammate again."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, if I'm being completely honest, I feel like it doesn't change a ton from how I lived my life over the course of the last year. Sponsorships stay the same. The people around me, agents and whatnot, have been able to help me and guide me through the course of the last year. I don't know if I would be in this moment if it wasn't for a lot of them. My mom has done a lot, my dad has done a lot. I think that's just the biggest thing. The advice I would say is just lean on the people around you. I don't have to do every single thing. I think at the same time, in college I always said my main focus is on basketball. That's why I've had every other opportunity in my life is because of the way I carry myself, the way I play the game. Going into my professional career, I plan to do the exact same thing. My focus is solely on basketball, being the best I can. I don't have to do school anymore. That's pretty exciting. I do have to get my degree. I graduate on May 14th. Other than that, my 110 percent focus is on basketball, and when I do that really well and carry myself really well, everything just kind of takes care of itself."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely. I'm actually an executive producer on the show, which has been kind of fun for myself. When Peyton Manning reached out, obviously it's his production company, I was a little skeptical at first, but I was like, I don't know if I really want to let people into my life like that. I've never really done it. But the way this year has unfolded, the way obviously Kamilla and Kiki, the seasons that they had, you can't script it any better. It's been absolutely incredible for women's basketball. If you're a women's basketball fan or you're not a women's basketball fan, I encourage you to watch the show when it comes out. I've seen bits and pieces. It's absolutely amazing. It really allows you to understand the student-athlete for way more than just a basketball player, and I think that's really important. I think that's going to allow fans of the W, fans of college to really understand what they go through, but love them even more for who they are and what they do and what they're about. I'm excited for everybody to see it, and it's been a special project."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely, and that's definitely our goal is to get back to championship habits. I think it's so cool for me. I vividly remember my freshman year during the bubble, we played Kentucky in the round of 32 and Tamika was calling the game and I was like tweaking out. I couldn't believe she was calling one of my games. Somebody I idolized, somebody that I loved and somebody that is not only a great basketball player and everything that she did but she's a tremendous person. I think that speaks to the organization as a whole, and everything that they do is so first class. I'm very lucky to be going there to an organization that really loves women's basketball. You see it today, I think they had 17,000 tickets claimed to just watch the draft. I think that shows the excitement in Indianapolis. It's a great basketball city. Obviously, what the Pacers have been able to do this year is special, in the Playoffs. I think I'm just excited. Like you said, there's a lot of young talent on the team, and just getting back to the Playoffs and doing everything we can to win a lot of basketball games is certainly the goal."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, honestly, I feel like this was definitely a little bit more emotional for me. I think that's because when you're in the heat of competition, you don't have time to really feel your emotions. You're so competitive and you're so fiery, you're not really worried about all that. I think that was the biggest thing through my career is, first of all, I was able to have a lot of closure in the way my career ended and everything I was able to do. Obviously, I played the maximum number of games I could play my senior year. Obviously, we didn't win, but you feel like you did everything you can to be in that moment and compete as hard as you can. But when you're kind of just sitting at a table waiting for your name to be called, I think that really allows the emotions to feed you and you're with your family. Obviously, playing a basketball game, I'm not out there with my family. So sharing that moment with them and enjoying it, and people that have really had my back and believed in me more than anyone, is super special."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Well, I know the Indiana Hoosiers didn't love me too much during my career, but hopefully we can turn a lot of them into Fever fans, if they're not already. I think going to a state that supports not only basketball but women's basketball, going and playing in front of -- at Indiana, the place is sold out. Doing the same for the Fever is certainly our goal, and having a lot of fans there every single night. For myself, I can't imagine a more perfect fit, a better place for me to start my professional career, an organization that really just believes in women's basketball and wants to do everything the right way. So I couldn't be more excited to get there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It means the most to me. Just tells me that I'm going to be in good hands, and I'm just excited to get there and get to work with her."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It's been an amazing day. It was my first time over there. Just a nice view. Getting my hair done and my makeup done was also amazing. Getting here, getting drafted was amazing. It's just been a really special moment for me, and everything is going just like I dreamt of."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I would say just getting in the league and bringing my winning leadership, my winning mentality. We won two national championships, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Just getting better, being more physical, more competition. I'm just excited to get out there and play with some of the big names of women's basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that was the dream, but honestly, no, I didn't really expect this. I'm just so proud that I am here right now. I know little Kamilla, when I was 13 years old, is also proud. I'm just excited to be here and happy."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It's been a crazy couple of days. I'm just so proud of my teammates for winning the national championship. I'm just so happy to be here. I got really emotional because the main goal was to get here and being able to give my family a better life, and just by looking at them and seeing them at my table was amazing. I obviously get emotional when I talk about my family because I'm so proud of everything I was able to accomplish and do for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,I think it's going to be great. She's a great player. I'm a great player. So two great players together. Nobody is going to get no rebounds on us.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I would like to go play overseas somewhere. I think that gets you better. Every time I played for my national team, it got me better somehow. So I'm excited to go to the WNBA and be able to play overseas somewhere."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that tells you a lot about Coach Staley. She gets you ready for this level. She gets you prepared for whenever you step to the next level, and like I said, that just tells you everything about her. She gets you super prepared for the league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I don't know, I'm just excited to get there, get to work, learn from the best and just step up my game. Step my game up."

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"I love that I get to stay on the West Coast, and I love that they took a chance on me, and I feel like I'm just going to show that I can work really hard and help them a lot. But also, I'll be close to family, which is really important for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"That's a good question. I would say I just want to continue the legacy of growing the sport, and I feel like I've said this a lot today, but we really have to look back at the women before us, and I know people keep saying this is a historic draft class but there were many, many talented draft classes before us. I just want to give my props to the Dawn Staleys, Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslies because they are why I'm here, because I watched them growing up. I just hope that I can continue that legacy for younger girls."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"So growing up, I said this earlier before, as well, but growing up, I was kind of first introduced to the league because my mom was a product line manager at Nike and worked on Dawn Staley's signature shoe and worked with Tamika Catchings and Jen Rizzotti, who I've played 3-on-3 basketball for. Growing up I had so much admiration for these women. It was really upsetting to not see that reciprocated by the public, what you see on social media, and I always do think the negative stands out more than the positive unfortunately, but it was really upsetting for me, and there were a lot of times where I was just kind of dumbfounded by the negativity. But I think now there's a positive switch, and hopefully we can just keep that momentum going."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"Yeah, so I studied communications at Stanford, and my parents both worked for Nike for 20-plus years, grew up in Beaverton. That's where the world headquarters are, so I'm definitely a Nike kid born and raised. But New Balance came to me with -- I see you're wearing New Balances, by the way. I love it. But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"Yes, to answer your first question, I think in these situations it's a business now, and you never know. I had great conversations with the Sparks and Raegan Pebley and Curt, and they're amazing, but you just never know, and I didn't want to assume anything. It's just such a high-stress environment, as well, so when they called my name, just a huge wave of emotions hit me. When I saw my mom tearing up and my dad, that definitely hit home. Just was super thankful. Actually, I actually FaceTimed Steph like five minutes before the show started. He just said to just have fun with it. I think he can just share so much great advice because obviously he's been through this, and he just said to make stuff like this fun because it can be stressful. So to make it fun. He answered my mom's FaceTime call. I called Seth Curry, as well. He hung up immediately because that's Seth. But then he called back right after. Yeah, they're both just great sounding boards for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU. But I specifically remember playing against Australia I think U-16 or U-17 it was, and honestly they're some of the strongest people I've ever played against. When they hit you with a screen, it takes you a while to recover. And Lauren Jackson is one of my favorite players ever. I just really admire her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Do you want to ask Cheryl or me? They turned up the pressure. It's the end of the game. Of course we are both trying to win. They turned up the pressure and we got a couple turnovers. We didn't execute our offensive plays at the end, so that's what their defense was doing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I saw a very physical and aggressive New York team. We know this from being a part of the game for so long that sometimes you get away with this stuff when you're physical and aggressive, and they certainly did. It's a shame that officiating had such a hand in a series like this. Obviously there's always going to be a team that's going to be a little more disappointed than the other. I thought today was incredibly disappointing. The challenge -- we have got to change our challenge rules. The officials doing the game should have a third party, because that was not a foul. That call should have been reversed on that challenge. If we sent that clip in -- well, first of all, Napheesa Collier, the number of times she was held, et cetera, there was nothing down on that end. For whatever reason in this series, that's kind of the way it was. At the other end, when we challenged it, if we would have turned that clip in, they would have told us that it was marginal contact, no foul. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. So when you review, those should be the same parameters that you're reviewing with. But the three people on the game need a third party to let them know. Because that decided the game. That decided the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"You watched the whole series, right? What makes her difficult is you're spending a lot of time guarding Sabrina and Stewie. In some of those schemes, it created mismatches. But we were going to live with some of that. We knew that JJ was going to score. These guys shot 30 percent. Shot 30 percent. The difference was in the foul line. Obviously we needed to execute better on offense I think one of these guys said that. We had opportunities not to fuel them. But we knew they were coming. We just needed -- our lead guard spot was obviously rough for us tonight. We get a little bit decent play out of there, we win the game. But with all that happened, we still almost put ourselves in position to do this. I hurt for our players. I really, really hurt. They are an incredibly special group."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think that was kind of the end-of-quarter situation. We were up 12. It was 32-20. We allowed them to come back to get it to within seven or something like that going into the half. That's where we have to be better. That's been throughout the series, too, that end of quarters and things like that. It's hard when you're playing a team at home, a team that knows each other well and things like that. It's hard to just pick one thing, you know what I'm saying, when you still have a chance to win the game. I think, yeah, we could have executed better, but there were so many things that went on throughout the game that we still gave ourselves a chance to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"It's been the same. Game 5, everybody is making their adjustments, mid-game, mid-possession. We are flying around. Everybody knows each other so well at this point. Everybody is trying to make a play and stop them from making a play. They made some plays in the second half."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,We talked about handling their pressure.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Handling the pressure, executing our offense, not turning the ball over to let them get energy in transition and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, probably because I was getting held a little bit. It was a little hard to make shots. No, I think, you know, of course, like they said, everyone is trying to make adjustments in the second half. I got a lot of shots up in the first. I was making a lot, so they tightened up their defense, brought people in rotation, were doubling, things like that. They were upping the pressure and it got harder."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I shared with them exactly what you said. Incredibly proud that since the day we got together in training camp all the way through to the end, we were the same team. We never got the disease of ""me."" Not one single player on the team got the disease of ""me,"" not one. Those that were maybe in the rotation, fell out of the rotation, some that never got to play, no one ever put themselves first, no one. That is incredibly difficult to find in this day and age. I'm really, really proud, incredibly proud of the number of people that were impacted by Lynx basketball and how excited they are to watch their team play. I told them, it's who they are as people and how they did it. So those are things we talked about. I wouldn't trade them for anyone. Anyone. Any team. Do things the right way. Built the team within the rules. Those sort of things that maybe right now aren't happening in our league. And did it the hard way. You know what, we gave hope to those teams that aren't willing to circumvent the cap or fly illegally or all the stuff that's happened over the last five years. Do it the right way gives hope for those other teams that you can build a team just like ours. You don't have to have a super team. You don't have to have that. There's a different way to do it. So I'm incredibly proud of them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, it's really rare. Saying that this is my 11th season, and I get to go out to fight with women that I consider sisters, that's why it feels the way it does. Every single day we came to work, we enjoyed being with each other, competing with each other, fighting for each other, and that's why we're here. That's why we gave ourselves a chance to compete for a championship, because we showed up every day and did it the right way and did it for each other. That's really rare in this league. The way that it's happening and all this other bulls--- that people make seem like it's important, it's not."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Obviously the exclamation point to the incredible season that she had. You know, Napheesa showed up big time for this team. Put us in a position to be within seconds of a championship. Phee was phenomenal."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"I'm always so in awe of Phee because she carries it with such grace. She carries it her own way. As a superstar in this league, it can become about something else. But she always keeps it about the team and always keeps it about winning and continuing to get better and better. I'm always in awe of her. Every time she steps on the court and the way she carries herself and no matter what's going on, she's so consistent. That comes from her. That's her internal -- amazing. We just have so much confidence in who she is on and off the court. I'm lucky to be alongside of her. I'm just in awe. She's had an amazing season and amazing postseason obviously. Can't wait to see what she does in the future."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"That's what's coming. I think greater recognition, that's what's coming. Phee has earned every bit of it. Like you said, still, the season she's had, it's not Phee that you're hearing about. It's other players. But I think Phee has earned it. We'll see going into next season if maybe she'll be a little bit more a face of the league."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Well, that's really loaded. It's a lot for me to think about right now, forgive me. I really don't have an answer for that. That's just pretty deep for me. And plus, there's proprietary secrets."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"No, she was tremendous in the playoffs. Really gave them a lift every single time she got minutes. Not surprised. They went big. It's crazy how the series ended. For four games, it was about the three ball, three ball, three ball. Certainly offensive rebounds throughout the whole thing. But then tonight came down to points in the paint. We don't even score in the paint and we had 44, was it, right. So it was really interesting how the series ended with them playing bigger. They won the game with their defense, no doubt about it, with their defense. Anyway, to your question, her minutes were really good, really helped them. I know all the headlines will be ""Reeve Cries Foul."" Bring it on. Bring it on. Because this s--- was stolen from us. Bring it on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We talked about it. We know we could have done some things, but you shouldn't have to overcome to that extent. This s--- ain't that hard. Officiating, it's not that hard. When someone is being held, be consistent. If you don't want to call it a hold at one end, don't call it at the other. Be consistent. Every team asks for that. Sandy asked for that last game. Three of the games in this series, we're talking about the same damn thing. So I tell these guys, for whatever reason, it didn't work out. It just doesn't feel right that you lose a series with that level of discrepancy. We don't have a team that whines and complains and all that stuff. Sometimes it probably hurts us. Maybe being a little more, I don't know, something. But you have a star player like Phee, that just, I don't get it. I don't get how she can be held and go to the basket and get hit, and then a marginal, at best, at best, sends their best player to the free throw line. I mean, that's tough. It's tough to swallow. Just like our 2016 championship that was lost -- officiating, missing a shot clock violation. This sucks. This is for a championship for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams. This isn't that hard. So it's disappointing. I mean, congratulations to the Liberty on their first championship. Been around, I don't know, how long has the league been around? 28 years? It took them 28 years. Congrats to them. We were that close to our fifth. Just didn't happen. It's disappointing. It's incredibly disappointing. But these guys, I mean, they've got to try to pick themselves up and go, ""We were that damn close."" It hurts. It hurts."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I've been like manifesting this moment for a while. And there's no feeling like it. You know, this game, and credit to Minnesota, because they gave us a tough series. The fans have been amazing everywhere we've gone. But to be able to bring a championship to New York, first ever in franchise history, it's an incredible feeling. I literally can't wait to continue to celebrate with the city because I know it's going to like, be bonkers. Bonkers. Fact, right."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I came in with a game plan of like, it doesn't matter. I want to play defense. I want to rebound. I want to do the little things, and I'll continue to be aggressive and shoot my shots. But if they are not falling, they are not falling. I'm not going to let that affect the way I do things. So continuing to be there for my team. I didn't talk about this, but before I made the free throws, I missed two free throws. I was like, no, I can't do this again, I can't. I have to be here. Olaf Lange, him and I have talked about being a python, where it's like you know your moment when to strike. At that moment, I was just thinking about being a python."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Good job. You were. Like it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Be a python.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"JJ can come sit up here, JJ. Let's go, MVP."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I thought they were pretty fair laughter. I mean, the last game, that's where you get give and take. Game No. 1, we should have won that game. I have so much respect for Cheryl, and I have so much respect for that Minnesota Lynx team, because man, that was ugly. But we found a way to win. I'm really proud of our team, how resilient we were, how we stuck together and how we continue to trust each other. That was our word today, just trust the process. We found a way to win. Then going back to Stewie, she did miss two free throws, which is rare for her. But in that five seconds to go, she said, ""I'm going to make 'em."" I'm like, good. I was praying laughter, but it worked."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'll start here. It's been 10 years, so a decade. I was due one. The last three or four, been runners-up, bridesmaid. It feels good. Now, it's a little bit different, because back then we were so dominant in Phoenix. We got through Minnesota Lynx in the semifinals and then it was 3-0 against Chicago and only the last game was tight when BG was out. This has been a grind every single game. There's things we could have done better, too. But we never strayed away from who we are as a team. I never strayed away from who I am as a coach. I think I just love these ladies here. They are amazing humans. They are fun to coach. But it's the same feeling. That was a great team, a very connected team, and so is this team. That's what I've said in the media a lot, haven't I. I said this feels like the 2014 team that I have coached. I'm just so happy, for everyone, this organization, but particularly these players, that we win today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"I don't know if they are bragging rights. It's for my whole family, basically, specifically Satou. She's been with me every step of the way and has been in my corner through my ups and downs, and I've had a lot of downs in my career. This ring is for her as much as it is for me."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"For me, I'm happy. Just really happy and trying to take in the moment and enjoy every aspect of it. I'm just up here smiling and thanking Jesus and thanking my teammates. Yeah, just enjoying the moment."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"No, I prepared her at halftime. I just felt, going with a bigger lineup, I said, okay, be ready, we may go for a big lineup. So Nyara, you're coming in. I just thought what she brings, she has that X-factor. Her ability to make one-on-one plays, to rebound the ball, to play great defense. I mean, all of it. And then to finish plays. Finish plays. So I prepared her. Really, really proud of her. I know she's had a lot of adversity over here career, but the biggest game of her career, and she really rose to the occasion. For a young player, that says a lot about her. I mean, the future is pretty bright."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Can I say something? Thank you. I think what's incredible about Ny is if you look back at the semifinal series, she didn't really play. Then she stayed ready and knew that in the Finals, her time will come and she continued to stick with it. When we needed her most, because you were the X-factor tonight, Ny. Listen, we were tired. We were trying to do whatever we could. We needed, like a spark and she was that. She continued to trust the process and we are so proud of Ny. So proud."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"When I hugged Stewie, I was sobbing in her ear. I didn't say one word. I was just crying the whole time. I'm so happy to win and do it with her. We talked about it so much, about coming together and what we envisioned of what we wanted to do in New York, and what we could do, to be able to pull it off and accomplish a dream. It's so freaking hard to do. It just means a lot. It means a lot. I told her this before, but I've watched Stewie be great for so long, in high school and then in college and then in the WNBA. For a long time, she was that person that I was kind of like chasing in college I want my game to be at her level and play against her in the WNBA and to ultimately be teammates. It really just means a lot to be able to win with her and to watch the way that she approaches the game every day. The way that she leads our team, because she is our leader and we look to her in tough moments. So it just really means a lot to have everything come together and to be able to win together."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation. But then I think it was picture perfect to be able to embrace JJ. Really what I was saying was like, she led us. Her dominance in the paint, on the boards, help-side defense. Everything that we needed, she was there. She had to wait awhile to get to this point, to get to the Finals to win a championship. But the wait was worth it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,Definitely was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"The wait was so, so, so worth it. We talked about it two years ago when it was free agency, and we wanted to come together. You look back and me, JJ, Sloot, we all came together to win a championship. Last year we lost in the Finals. But look at us, now we're here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"There's no practice tomorrow, so...."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,No practice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was like, let's go. You know, I've won one championship. I've been in many Finals and competed for so long. It's hard to win because this league is so good. You need a little bit of luck on your side, but you also need talent. You also need talent, the right talent to put together. I think Jonathan Kolb did a really great job of getting these players to come to New York and sell the vision that we had here. We wanted to win. New York has never won before. Now we are going to go in the history books as the first ever. That makes me very proud. Because it's hard. People think it's easy. Look, I was excited just to coach great talent. I didn't really know them that well. I knew Stewie probably a little bit more than JJ because I coached her wife, Marta, in Phoenix. Hopefully that helped a little bit to get her here. It's a journey. So it's getting to know each other. I think it's been fun. Hey, let's not stop at one, though. Let's go for two."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"I'm not really sure exactly when we flipped the switch. I just remember just like weathering the storm and us really talking about making sure we kept our emotions in check and that we just kept executing and that it was going to be a grind. I think obviously we came out with the win, but I don't really remember an exact moment where the switch was flipped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,How big was Leo's three in the corner? I'm going to tell you this as a fact Whoever scores first in overtime usually wins. I was confident after that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Am I really the only New Yorker on this team? That is incredible. Honestly, winning in Seattle was amazing and nothing takes away from that. But to be able to bring the first ever to the Liberty and the first in 51 years -- like you guys know, my first WNBA game I ever went to was at MSG, was the Liberty. And to have that be full circle was amazing. Today throughout my whole day, everybody was texting me, like, ""How are you? Are you ready?"" All these things. ""Do your thing."" And I was calm. I was ready because I knew that no matter what, the city was going to have our back. They showed up and they showed out, and they continued to be there for us when we needed. I'm so proud of this team but so happy to be able to bring the first championship here because the city deserves it. Listen, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen this next week, but I'm sure s--- is going to be crazy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,Parade in the Bahamas.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Definitely. I think we need to have a parade in the Bahamas. Let's go! Really, really proud of JJ. I love coaching her. I just love her personality, how she brings it every single day. She was big for us. It wasn't a pretty game today. But we were trying to establish her early. At both ends, she worked her butt off. Usually I don't like to play her 42 minutes, but she just stayed competing because that's how important it was. She knew how she needed to help us. She's been big for us. She's been big for us all season long but particularly these playoffs. She's amazing. We love you, JJ. So proud of you, mate. You deserve this. Your first one, baby."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,We want to have an exhibition game in the Bahamas next year. SANDY BRONDELLO Parade.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Parade, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"Parade, too. For me, just trying to get the infrastructure of the Bahamas to be a little bit better for sports and especially girls sports in the Bahamas to be a little bit better. I think you need more investment in sports in the Bahamas, to give the kids more games and to allow them to be able to have more developmental camps and different things going on. Just to have more people invested in it. I want to make it my mission to help just grow the game in the Bahamas because we have so much natural talent. So many people that come out of the Bahamas go to the U.S. and go to school, end and up be being really successful. I would like the kids to be able to stay home in the Bahamas and stay with their families and then still be able to come to the U.S. to play professionally. That's the next step we have to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"I'm really proud of my journey. I was talking to Rebecca Lobo earlier after shootaround and just basically telling her, I was doing this thing where we are about to run out after our theme or whatever and they would have the theme music playing. I would look up and be just taking everything in and just really being appreciative of the moment and just having a moment of gratitude without -- with all the chaos that was going on in the Finals, just a moment to just exhale, to breathe and just look around at all the things that we've been able to do, and all the people that are in the gym watching women's sports and the city, like Stewie said, really supporting us. That really helped keep things in perspective. I went out there to play to win and not to lose. The experience that I had, even though it wasn't the best experience and we lost in the past, it allowed me to be a little bit more relaxed in the situation and just understand that these moments aren't guarantees. It's not a given. You have to kind of just take advantage of it but also live in the moment and really appreciate what it took to get here, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"That's a big lineup right there. But I mean, it means a lot, obviously. She did say something at halftime. But I feel like throughout the whole season, it's been unwavering support, whether from Sandy or my teammates and in general, everybody in this organization has always kind of believed in me, which means so much. They drafted me knowing I had to sit out a year. That just shows how much trust they have in me. I feel like this whole season, every time I'm on the floor, my teammates have my back and tell me just to keep going, work hard. It means the world to be able to have players like Stewie and JJ, who I've looked up to my whole career, be my teammates, and now win a championship with them. That's something that I will remember forever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"It's really hard to compare the Olympics to this moment. Especially with Team USA, because at the Olympics, we were going for eight straight gold medals. The pressure is insane, but also the pressure bringing a championship to a city that has never had one, especially in the WNBA, has been a lot. I don't know, this is something that I think I'll be remembering forever, and each Olympics I also remember forever. But the time together is so short. Like, it's three weeks. But like, this is my team. This is my squad. We continue to go to battles together. With the Olympics, you come together for a few days. You have practice and then you go and you play exhibition games against Germany in London, and it's hard to build that chemistry and stuff. But you just know you're Team USA and here now, we're New York Liberty. I don't think I answered your question, but each one is really special, and they are not comparable."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, this one? This is more personal. This is more personal because I'm from New York. I'm from upstate. I came here for a reason, and that's to win a championship."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,Thank you for that shaking Breanna's hand.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Yeah, I mean, it's really just the -- thinking in German, sorry."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,You speak German? Go for it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Really it's just the mental preparation of staying ready and being locked in, knowing that whenever you have -- like whatever minutes you get, that's what you get and you need to be ready to go on the floor. Because our team has such a high standard, and really, to be able to live up to that, you have to be mentally ready. Otherwise, you'll just kind of hurt the team in the long run. But with great teammates like that, it's kind of easy to just get on the floor and leave it all out there. Because my role is pretty simple Run the floor, get rebounds and maybe shoot some buckets. But they make it really easy. They make it really easy for me. It's just like I always said, there's so much talent on the floor, and just being able to bring something to that is just something everybody dreams of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Pepper, we got you. We got you. But it's not tomorrow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just went in and told them what I saw and what we needed to do, the adjustments. Obviously I didn't think we were playing with the right amount of urgency. Things were a little too easy for them, and so I just encouraged them. Hey, let's go, 20 more minutes. Then I talked about the big lineup. Be ready for the big lineup. I just thought, I was thinking that all day today, and if things are going hard, we're fatigued. It's been a grueling schedule, five games, and that's a tough team, just the way that they make us work really hard. So I kind of prepared Nyara in that regard and I'm very thankful that it worked well for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,I'll talk for the players.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Yes, please."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think what we said was Minnesota, they had 34 points at halftime. Our offense wasn't coming easy, but eventually it was going to come through. Continue to shoot your shots with confidence. But if it's going to be an ugly game, we will win ugly. We've talked about first five minutes, first five minutes, whatever. No. Third quarter. Third quarter is going to be our quarter, especially with the city behind us and the fans behind us. We came out and continued to execute. I think throughout the entire game, we talked about coming together. Huddling, talking about schemes, making sure everybody is calm and confident. And we did that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yes, we did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,Seven games next year.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Seven, nice. Hopefully we have more time. Basically we knew we had more in the tank to give and 20 more minutes for the end of the season. I felt like, because I was just thinking about today, and it's like whether we win or lose, we want to put it all on the line. Because last year when we lost, there was more in the tank. And this year, that wasn't happening."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure. All season long, Lan has been in those positions for us. Just appreciate her ability to turn around and buck up and do what her team needed her to do. She's important. Important for her to be on the floor for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I thought it was obvious what we were trying to do. We went four flat and said, Court, make a play. The last thing we said was, we've got to get the last shot. Didn't want to shoot too early. Make sure we get the last shot. We said, BC Bridget Carleton, if you have a chance, follow it up and see if you can tip one in and get fouled laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments. I think the players, the players deserve all the credit for the show that we are being treated to. I thought both teams played well. It was a good game. Obviously both teams, things you can point to -- you wish you made a layup or you wish you didn't do this or that. That's the way a game always is. But no, I'm looking forward to seeing what the ratings are for this one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"The same defense as always. Try to make it as hard as possible for them to get the shots they want. They are good players. They are going to get shots off. But they can't get easy ones. So that's my goal, to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I think it's an epitome of the year she's had and how important she's been to the team. Shot making, big three. She's a hustle-play player, so that was on display. Go give yourself a chance to maybe either put it in or get fouled. That's just what she does every day we are around her. She's the same. You can always count on her to be there for you. We're obviously super proud of Bridget."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Same. I completely agree. I feel like Bridget is just so reliable every time. Like Coach said, we can bank on her to make those hustle plays and to be cool and collected at the end to make those free throws. That's the hardest shot, honestly, in basketball, is to make free throws at the end of the game. To make those at the down at the big moment is who BC is. They were saying Naz Reid free tattoos. I think BC free tattoos is next."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I think you hit the nail on the head. It's unfortunate those teams were a joy to watch. But it's a sign of the times where we are now. I don't know about these guys, but I know when I'm out and I'm in different places and I'm going to one, everyone is talking about it. Everyone is talking to me about it, talking about, I go to this bar, and this is a bar that maybe wouldn't have a women's game on five years ago. All the TVs have the game on and the volume on, and the place is going crazy. I heard that so many times in different establishments. And obviously I appreciate the opportunity that A Bar of Their Own has given women in making that front and center. I'm happy to support a woman-owned business like that. I just think that what this team has done, obviously the Wolves energized the city in their playoff run, and I'm thrilled to see the same energy came for this team because they deserve it. Obviously the crowd was there tonight, but even more than that, everywhere you go around the city, people are talking about the Lynx."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"It's really tough. I think we are both great players. It was Game 4 and we played each other, what, four times in the regular season. It's going to get harder and harder each time to get the shots that you normally get. Everyone is out there to do the same thing make shots hard. That's my goal every time. She's a great player, one of the best players in the world. But you have to make it as hard as you can for her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to answer the second part, the Game 5. I don't really think about the other ones. I do feel very blessed in my career to have a chance to have been a part of so many. Haven't won them all. You know, when I was in Detroit, we suffered a heartbreak at home. So it runs the gamut. I think that what I'm just thrilled about is that this group gets to experience the Game 5. It's beyond words how we feel about this team, and we just so wanted them to be in the Finals, No. 1 and two, put themselves in a position to win a championship, and we've done just that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I didn't get a response from the league. I have a text to prove it. I think that -- I think Phee has some things to prove that the fouls weren't called. That's unfortunate. You know, I guess I don't really have much more than that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,Wish I knew. I'd either not eat or not sleep or I'd sleep really good if I knew the difference. It's two great teams. Who knows? Who knows.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"I wanted to come out and enjoy the moment and be as aggressive as possible. When you're playing for your season, after the last game you sit with everything, and you erase it and you want to leave all those internal feelings and put it out there and embrace the crowd. I just wanted to be out there with my teammates and give it everything we had. Shots go in, they don't go in, whatever. There are always things you can fix. But I was just excited to be out there and compete again after the last game. Shots were falling. That's always a good thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,We were celebrating together and she was saying how proud she is of us and the team. I was telling her that she has to get her butt to New York.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Anybody that has been following along knows this team, from the beginning of the season all the way through to Game 4, has this unique ability to believe in themselves and believe in each other. What we said before the game, can we do it in the toughest of times, right. Because this will be the most that we are tested. We talked about it in shootaround. This will be the most this group has been tested in that way. I was sure how we would connect and compete. Not sure whether you're going to win the game or not. But I was sure that we were going to be the Minnesota Lynx and how we have done things all season long. You know, the ups and downs and all of that, this group is just equipped to handle it. It's special."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"It was expected. Going into the game, we talked about it in the pregame that we were going into the game as if that didn't happen. Whatever was going to show itself was going to show itself and we were going to react. But we didn't have any minute restrictions and anything else we were doing to modify. Just competed. We did try to get some players off the floor a little bit more. This one Collier -- we thought about it. But I think overall I was concerned about leaving Lan too long on the bench, sitting too long. But other than that, we weren't concerned."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, Ceci is tough. You know, goes through a stretch of games where maybe she's not contributing like she wants to contribute, and then all of a sudden we had a Ceci sighting at shootaround the other day and these last two games really helping us. I'm just happy for her. We've always stayed in touch through the years. We've always tried to get her back here. Timing was good for this one, and she's been a great fit for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,Sounds like he's rooting for them. He didn't text that to me.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,I love it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,Huskies drama.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,Looks like I'm going to have to text him about some things now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Bench was really important. We knew they were going to be. They were ready. They were ready. There was a lot of conversations, the teammates, getting them going and getting them ready to be able to make contributions when they got in the game. Give Dorka credit as she remained patient, and when she got the opportunity, I thought her minutes were good. We'll look at the video. But it was nice to be able to have players able to sub in and stay out there for extended time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,Is that why we missed layups so we can get down to the nitty-gritty? Is that what she's saying? Laughter.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. Laughter. My heart is still racing. I think we gain energy and confidence from one another. I feel like internally we are strong, strong-minded mentally and physically. We have a lot of belief within our group. We problem solve with each other. It's just a belief, like, internally. I don't know how else to explain it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"I think we're excited. I don't even know if I'm thinking about that. I'm thinking that it's a Game 5 of the Finals, that we need to go out and execute. That's really all I'm thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, last 40 minutes of the season. It could be anywhere, really. It doesn't matter. We are going to be out there together going to war, and I'm pumped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Elite players play no matter the environment, home, road. Elite players play and they love the environment and they are not affected by the environment. That's why you see the series has been what it has, winning on each other's court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to say probably information gathered in the three games. Everything is getting harder. So the edge that maybe other games that provided each team, there's no secrets at this point."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I actually was trying to call a timeout, but they didn't hear me. So that's on me. But yeah, you know, it wasn't our best possession. It was loud in here. I don't know, maybe I just have to sprint out in the middle of the court next time. So I've got to be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think that I was going a little bit too fast. I just needed to slow down. They are sending multiple people when I'm slipping on a screen, stuff like that. A little bit better awareness on my part. But quick turnaround and be ready for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"With the two seconds? Yeah, it was like a little screen to get JJ to the block. If not, Sabrina had to come out. So with two seconds, we tried to establish the big girl down low. They defended it well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, obviously they are great players. I think Stewie said it, we took some shots, we probably could have moved it a little bit more. But look, I will say this, and I look at the thing here and I know Cheryl talked about it last time, but we got no calls today. So do I need to talk up in a press conference? Because they were getting ticky-tacks. And we went down there and got hit and get nothing. It was like 12-6 at halftime and they tried to even it up near the end. It was 14-9. No. All we want is fair, okay. So if we are getting hit, that's a foul. You know, I'm one of the nicest bloody coaches in this league, but this pisses me off. Just be fair. You know, if they are getting hit, it's a bloody foul. But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that expletive timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,It's a close-out game. Their backs are against the wall and we are trying to win. It was going to be that type of game tonight where we are both trying to claw and both teams are trying to figure out whatever to do to get over the hump.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, that's what we said we worked for all season long. Minnesota did what they needed to do here to tie it up, and now we go back home. We love playing in front of our home crowd. So it will definitely be another sellout, and it will definitely be loud. And we have to bring our ""A"" game. I have a lot of respect for Minnesota, don't get me wrong. This is a really tough team, really tough team. They play well. They compete. So we've got one more game, and we're going to win on our home court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Short-term memory. Just the fact that all that happened tonight is the series is even, and there's a Game 5, winner-take-all. We are going back to New York, and we're going to get it done. You know, getting it done there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, of course. We wanted to get it done tonight. But like Sandy said, our fans are like no other, and to be able to go into our environment on Sunday, know they have our backs. So whenever there are tough situations, whenever we're fighting through all of this adversity, we know we have the crowd behind us. That's just going to continue to motivate us. Yeah, can't wait for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think that, you know, for our team, we bounce back after a loss really, really well, and making sure that everybody is on the same page going forward. In the playoffs, in a series, there's going to be momentum shifts. There were momentum shifts in the game tonight. But mentally, understanding what's our ultimate goal, how are things going right here. Like Sandy said in the locker room, we haven't won anything yet we haven't lost anything yet. And we have the opportunity to do that Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"You know, I thought as you said, we had the appropriate effort and focus on what we were doing. As the game wore on, the offense got harder and harder for us. I just think that one of the things, and you know, like I was saying after Game 1, you feel like the ball isn't moving enough, and I think we got easy stuff when we were able to do that. We were taking hard shots. We had good shots. Didn't make shots, right, and that's what it comes down to. Stewie was making shots. JJ's big three when we were up four, that was a big three. Then obviously Ionescu's shot at the end. It's a battle. We talked about that, players making plays. Unfortunately, we didn't make enough of them to put the ball in the hole."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I mean, I'll let these guys talk about that. Go ahead, you guys. Jump in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I feel like they were making plays at the end of shot clocks and like Coach said, we were getting really good looks. We just weren't executing on the offensive end. It's just hard when you get that and then obviously they are a great offensive team and like Coach said in the locker room, it just puts a lot of pressure on our defense. I think we just need to make more shots, honestly."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I don't have an update, game finished what, 15 minutes ago? I haven't talked to the trainer."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,Great player made a good shot. I guarded her for 40 minutes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, obviously give credit to Lan. She did what should he could do. We were plus 20 when she was on the floor. So it obviously hurt. Our starting five is a really good starting five, and you know, not having Lan, foul trouble, and then just not feeling like she could go put us in a bit of a bind. You know, tried different things. You know, just a little bit of a small lineup. See if we could spread the floor and get some easier shots but that didn't produce itself either. We need our starters, just like they need their starters."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I don't necessarily know that it was -- obviously got fouled. She was, you know, asserting herself in that way. The game is called differently for Phee than it is for Stewie for sure. You look at the same level of activity, and around-the-rim contact. For whatever reason, we have a hard time getting to the foul line in this series. I think they were getting some switches that they were picking on. You know, as Lan was switching on her. She made some great plays. She attacked, she made threes, she got it going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Our defense gave us a chance to win the game. Our defense gave us a chance to win the game, period, and our offense is going to help our defense. If you told me that we would have got the amount of stops that we did and we were playing off that, and we wouldn't have scored 80, that would be surprising to me. This team scored 80, its 77-all with the remaining seconds left. I'll have to look at the film. I know when I was watching it live, I liked some of the shots that we were getting. I've seen our players make those shots. You know, it's not to sit here and say, you know, that New York doesn't get credit for, you know, their defense. Just they are a good defensive team. I'll have to watch it but I felt like we got some good opportunities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, yeah. We just need to score the ball a couple times. Just a couple times. We were up four. Like I said, that JJ three sort of changed things for them, right. If we get that stop and we just score one or two more times, that's our game. It's a hard-fought game, right. Really great game. That's one that, you know, we convert just a couple and it's our game. So, our defense, and like the things that you mentioned, we did those things. We played well enough at that end. Obviously, it seems crazy to say when Stewie has 30 but you know, she had 38, 39 on us and they only scored 78, 79 points. We were right there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure. For sure. That's what we just talked about. This is Phee's first Finals. So she's feeling these things for the first time. K-Mac has been there. The hardest thing to do, I imagine you guys feel it when you are watching, there's so many ups and downs and swings and all around, and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to sort of weather those swings, and here we are. We're disappointed. We're home. We played well and just couldn't come up with the win. It's important that you don't get too high when you win and too low when you lose, and it's really hard. It's really, really hard but we've got to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home with our tremendous fans. And you know, we'll see what we can do on Friday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it feels great. I mean, that's something that -- obviously it's the ultimate goal is to be here and to get a win. Doesn't feel great right now, obviously, with a loss. But I am excited to look at film and see what we can do better. I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end. But it feels amazing. The crowd was awesome. To play at home in the Finals is such a rush. So definitely looking forward to the next game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Her contributions today, she was back to being BC for us. So we were glad to see that, and we'll continue that into game four."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,That was just a great All WNBA Second-Team performance laughter. That's it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was. But I mean, you know, in the time-out, Sandy kind of was just like, you're going to shoot this shot. You know, I feel like I was able to get a little separation in range and get a really good shot to go. Obviously wanting to let the shot clock wind down. And got the space that I needed to get my feet under me and felt comfortable taking that shot. Sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn't. I've practiced that shot a thousand times in my head, on the court, and I feel like that's just something that as athletes, you put yourself in that position to want to be able to make a shot. And obviously like we don't win this game without Stewie. What she was able to do, just continued to chip away. Obviously she'll speak, but I mean, yeah, there's nothing I could say. Like that shot's nice but that doesn't go against what she's been able to do for us tonight and how she was able to just will us back into that game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we were all kind of just waiting for our moment. You know, waiting for the script to flip a little bit. You know, they talked about it. They talked about first five minutes, going to come out punching. They punched us in the face in the first quarter and we continued to wear them down. We knew that our pace was something that made them tired and for me, it was just kind of like I was motivated. I was mad. And I liked my matchups that I had, and really kind of attacking them to make sure that we could get this back into where we needed to be for it to be a ballgame."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Just continuing to kind of be in help side and know that we did some different schemes. We sometimes were sending two to the ball and then leaving somebody open and making sure that, you know, between JJ and I, like we are going to protect the rim at all costs and make sure that nothing is easy, because this is the Finals and everything is going to be tough and we're going to make everybody work for it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,That's why I can't be miked up.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I'm not sure exactly what the situation was. Might have been when it was 71-69, because I feel like we were at that score for a long time. But just I could feel it. You know, you could feel the momentum was shifting to our side. They were up and their shots weren't falling. We were getting good looks, and it's like, if we are going to be this close, we are not leaving here without this win. It's tough to play in this arena, but the way that we continued to stay together is something that I'm not shocked at but I am really proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,I was mad we were losing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"We know we're one game away from winning the championship, and I think that they are going to give us their best shot. They are going to give everything they have got, and you know what, so are we. The turnaround is quick but we are going to continue to be ready. There's a lot of things that we didn't do right tonight and have a kind of quick memory. I think that we're happy we got this win but we're -- the job's not done."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I just went up and gave him a big shot. Him and Jodie Berry, our assistant coach came down and he kind of told me the same thing, like there was never a doubt. Obviously him, Sandy, all the coaches that I've had, just their continued belief and pouring into me means the world to me whether I make or miss that shot. Like the fact that they kind of trusted me to go out there and make big shots, that's why I love playing for this team and continue to pour my all."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's pretty special. It was never in doubt. Obviously Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there, but I thought the right time, this is Sabrina. She just made a big shot. She's a great shooter and she just needed a little bit of separation."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not. Yeah, definitely the biggest shot of my career and hopefully not the last."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,It did. Pretty nice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Not for us. I think that, you know, this feels like we're playing on their home court, and I feel like each game is so different. You know, you go from 1 to 2 to 3. But the way that we continue to fight and be resilient. I don't want to speak for you guys. Doesn't feel like Game 1 to me. Feels like Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"At this point, I don't know."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think -- well, I think the way that we fought back in the second, knowing that our offense didn't really click yet but we were able to limit them defensively. But then in the third, when we had a strong push, a strong punch. You guys know the first two games, our third quarters have been a struggle to score offensively. We were getting downhill. We were attacking and we were being confident. If a mistake happened, like a turnover or a missed shot or like something just doesn't go our way, we didn't panic. We continued to play and continued to fight through it because we know how big this moment is. We have the experience of the good, bad, ugly, and different."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, we didn't come out how we wanted to start the game. We knew they'd threw the first punch. I thought we weren't playing how we wanted to play physically, mentally with the pace and everything. But credit to them. They were taking us out of stuff that we wanted to do and they were making big shots. I trust this team. I feel like we've grown so much. We've handled adversity even from Game 1, you know what I mean? It's like, okay, this is a totally different game here and we just had to chip away. But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game. I did. I felt confident. Even with that last shot I felt confident, okay, because we worked hard and we found a way to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think that what the big three means is between Sab, JJ and myself, we know when it's our time to step up and to make an impact. And over the course of the game, it's like sometimes things are hard. Sometimes things are frustrating. I pick up two fouls in the first quarter. But knowing that our team trusts and believes in us to be in this position to take these shots, to help get the game in the right place, but at the same time we wouldn't be here without our teammates, and having that trust and belief just gives us confidence. I don't know. Like, you guys talk about the run, Sab's shot. There was so many players that came in that were like such an important piece of what we were able to do tonight just because they made Minny tired and that's what makes this team really special. It's a collective win even though some of us are shining a little bit brighter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I think it's important to just read the game, and being able to get downhill and find JJ on a really important basket that, helped us late in the game. Because you're just not really one-dimensional. The defense doesn't know what you're going to do Are you going to shoot it are you going to pass it? Are you going to be a screener, a decoy? There's just so many opportunities that when you have the gravity we have to be able to make it tough on the defense. JJ was huge for us. The way that she protected the rim, hit a huge three, hit that layup, like just continue to go chip away, and it was a total team effort. Like Stewie said, we're not here without every single person on this team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Just in the locker room waiting on Stewie. I would say I really didn't realize how far out I was. Yeah, like I kind of, you know, wasn't sure if I was dribbling with my right or left hand and then I was like, oh, yeah, I did hit that step-back. But I just didn't really realize how far I was, but like I said, it's a shot that I take often and I take in practice and that I take before the game. It's not like a Hail Mary, hope this goes in. It's like, once I got it off, I was like, yeah, this is in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I was really, really happy with Nyara. It was the plan to give her a few more extra minutes tonight. Stewie came in a little sooner because Stewie got two fouls early. She played so hard. She was winded by the end of those seven minutes. We played her seven minutes in a row but she was so effective. Just the ability, they were being so aggressive, and what Nyara brings is she's always on her front foot getting downhill. She's always going to run the floor, just a hundred miles an hour, which is what we needed. So it's been great to see her growth, and yeah, it was never in doubt there. But obviously I went to Slooty early, too, and I thought that changed the pace of the game. We struggled a little bit. Not often do I sit both of these at the same time, very rarely. But I felt like we needed to at that moment, and I think they gave us really good energy. We got it back to ten after that first quarter, and I think that was the thing. We've got to keep grinding, keep grinding, and as the game went on, we got back to playing Liberty Basketball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Our offense was bad at a time when we really needed it. Our pace was slow. Taking too long to get into things, and you know, I don't think we were terribly hard to play against from that standpoint. And that was obviously a difficult time to be doing that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm disappointed that we let it get to 17. I'm more disappointed in that. I'm more than disappointed, I'm pissed that that happened again."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Sure, did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,It's hard. You have to adjust to the refs. Definitely it's not an excuse. We played really bad. I'm definitely not using that as an excuse. But it's hard to adjust because you are playing one way and you are getting used to the refs and then they change it up. But that's not why we lost. It wasn't them. It was us. Can't blame that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"It's been talked about a lot. This is a group that problem solves well together. They never think they are out of it. Their belief in themselves and their belief in each other is top-notch. And we know it's a long game. They are very experienced. We just knew what we had to clean up, get some things cleaned up and we did that then. Put ourselves in position, right where we wanted to be and just couldn't get over the hump."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I don't think it affected the game. I don't know if it affected her play. Phee can answer that. It was a chance to get her three minutes of rest and at the end of the quarter, that was fine, and then she went back in. So it didn't affect us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Huge difference. So both games they have gotten help from part of their -- they have a big five, right, their starters are all very capable, just like our starters are all very capable and you need players beyond your stars, and for two games, they have done that. We're having trouble getting that consistently and we've got to have that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I mean, yeah, obviously you want to steal one on the road. We're really disappointed I think in how we played today but excited to go home and play in front of our crowd, and we have to respond. We have to come out playing better than we did in these two games. It's hard. Like we are both competing for a championship. You have to play with a level of desperation from the very beginning, and so that's what we're going to need to do to come out in Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,I honestly don't feel like I changed my mindset. I feel like I stayed aggressive on defense. I was frustrated that I had those four fouls but I don't think it affected me in the way that I was playing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"No, I happen to agree with you. I had a chance to talk to Joe Ingles, I don't know if I told Lan this when we were in Minnesota, and he asked me how I liked my Australian. And we talked about all the ways that we love the way that Lan plays and her level of compete, and that's what Joe said. He's like, one thing you're darned sure an Australian is going to do is compete their tails off. And Lan is the very definition of that. Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how difficult it is. Lan is always there for us in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We were trying to get another ball handler out there, somebody they had to pay attention to, try to get downhill a little bit, try to create some easier opportunities playing with flow. Setups weren't necessarily producing anything for us, so we just thought, spread the floor and play with two ball handlers."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Well, I mean, what did she have at half, 12? Ten of them were in fast break. Ten of them were fast break. So what changed is she wasn't able to get it in the fast break and we had her in the halfcourt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I think Stewie is the same. I don't think making her missing a shot or free throw. We do this long enough that those things happen. She's resilient. She played exactly like we thought she would. I thought she played great in Game 1. And so you know, I think her impact defensively was something that we felt. You know, what did she have, seven steals? And so you know, she's been doing that in these playoffs. More than that, in my mind -- you have to ask Stewie, but I don't think that's what was on her mind. I think what was on their collective minds is it's a must-win game for them and they came out and played like it was, and they took the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, but I think the opponent has a fair amount to do with it. We have to come up with better opportunities and better things that we can do offensively so that we can get back to a little bit more of a balanced scoring. So I think that's most important to say is New York has had a lot to do with this."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"You've got players that are playing a lot of minutes, a lot of heavy minutes, and any time you can get your bench to come in and be productive and you can keep them out there longer, that's an advantage. But I don't think either bench has been necessarily a separator. We talked about Hiedeman in the last game. She scored it. I think she had ten, right. So that was impactful. But you know, both teams are looking for anywhere else you can go so that you don't have all this pressure on your top players."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"What we continued to keep saying to one another was like stay together, keep playing. Every rebound matters. And even if our offense gets a little bit stagnant and funky, we are not going to let that dictate what we do defensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, massive. They have been going under on screens so we encouraged her to shoot the three. She's a great three-point shooter. She was stroking it yesterday in practice before the game. Yeah, she was digging deep and that's what we needed. We knew we needed to bounce back and it was a big bounce-back game. They contained Leonie a little bit after what she did in Game 1 but B helped us get this margin to win the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. Just like not letting history repeat itself and knowing that Game 1 happened but now, you know, how can we control Game 2 and I think that honestly the thought process was, we were trying to be up a little bit more. Like not letting them get to the three-point line to set up their offense. And then in to out, whether I'm helping, I know that Sab or whoever else is helping on my backside, and making them have to move just a little bit quicker than they want to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"No. Honestly -- sorry, I'll just rant laughter. I kind of texted him and I was like, you know what it's about time that you come to my game. I've been here for two years and he hasn't come down. What are you doing? Yeah, CD Dailey came and she got that same message, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a long drive.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Two hours.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B brings is this grit, this toughness, knowing that -- and all of us know, she's giving us whatever she's got, and the way that she continued to be aggressive, they were going under on her and she knocked that thing down with confidence, got into the paint, drive and kicks. But that's what we're used to. We know she can do this and happy to see her get into a good rhythm with everything that's been up and down this season and know that she's a big factor in everything we do."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think that the first thing was higher pick-up points, knowing that if Leo was going to be up, really trying to limit Courtney Williams, then I need to be there, too. So when Phee is dribbling up it's without any pressure. Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"That's really what my goal was, was just take what the defense gives me and not forcing anything but understanding I'm going to be able to drive and kick. And players hit, multiple players hit really big shots. But obviously I think coming out like that was great for us to get going. And then in the second half, they made some adjustments and I think it was understanding being able to drive passing lanes and find the open man, if they are going to bring a few on the ball. So I just did that. I don't always need to be looking to score every single time I have the ball. Just continue to make the right read and understanding what it is that provides our best offense as a team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think everyone has seen her. She's been struggling but she's been feeling good these last few days, can tell you that much. She has been. We just knew it was a bit of time. We've given her so much rest here and she was ready to go. She puts the work in. Like I said, she's tough. We talked about the grittiness that she gives us. But it's great that you put the ball in her hand and be more of a playmaker, because it takes a little bit more pressure off these two in particular. I thought that was very effective for us. But her defense, she was everywhere. She was guarding everyone. I'm really happy for her. We just have to freshen up and get ready for the next game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B and I were continuing to say in the huddles was defensively, you know, the schemes because they went small. So it means our matchups are a little bit different. And making sure that we have each other's help. If we are weak side, who is high, who is low. Just those type of things, and knowing that like scores and stops, we're playing the long game in the last two minutes, and making sure that we are all are on the same page."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I mean, I think we missed her grittiness and just she's the ultimate competitor. She takes pride -- she used to always guard the best player and obviously now we have Leo, too, that makes us really a versatile defensive team. But you also miss her play-making. That's something we talked about this year. We wanted to make sure she could play-make more and it was hard for to play-make when she was hobbling around with the knee. We need her to get confidence first, and then to go out and play. She's just impactful because she plays at both ends of the floor, and plays hard, and she's a winner. So happy that she got the success tonight and keep building on it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Well, I'm not from here. Geno. Vivian, has been here for B. It's great. It's a full house tonight. It was really loud."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Largest crowd ever. SANDY BRONDELLO Loudest. BREANNA STEWART Largest. SANDY BRONDELLO Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,She's not from here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'm not from here. Loudest? Largest. I'm not from here. It's great. We talked about the winner is women's basketball, WNBA. So many fans coming out to watch these amazing players play, but yeah, they are all welcome. All coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,My coach is coming to Minnesota.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Okay. Kelly is coming. SABRINA IONESCU Go Ducks.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think the moment the game ended Thursday night, I was looking forward to Sunday, just to be able to kind of change things, change the narrative a little bit, and know that I'm going to come out and be the same that I was and be obviously better. But throughout this entire process, my team has my back every step of the way and was just excited to have another opportunity to go to battle with them. Because we have a lot of fun in everything that we do, and you know, it's not always like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"It was the difference in this last game. I think that especially after watching the film of Game 1, we slowed down to a pace that is a little bit awkward for us. We want to play fast and we want to move the ball and we want to get downhill and we want to score, obviously. So making sure that no matter what, we continue to play fast, we get good shots and we get that defense moving."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Understanding how teams are playing me and being able to make that adjustment in real time. Possession by possession, quarter by quarter, teams have kind of changed the way they have guarded, whether they are switching, hedging, trapping. And I think being able to just be poised and understanding what it is that I need to do in order to create an advantage for the team that we have out there on the floor is what I've always wanted to do, and I feel like I've been able to do that in a really good spot. Obviously my teammates set really good screens and are able to get me open in order for me open to create for them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"I'd say it worked pretty well for us, understanding that we use our big lineup and knowing that, you know, we can get the ball inside. We can switch. We're able to apply pressure defensively with our length and being able to get steals and just disrupt their flow. But obviously it's a series and it's a chess match and they are going to throw different adjustments, and I think our ability to stay poised and being able to kind of see what it is that they are doing in real time is going to be crucial. Now we have seen their small ball lineup and we're going to go back and find ways that we can execute while they have that group on the floor."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we weren't happy the way we played we and we talked about our principles of play. We have it on our wall, there's a way that we want to play when we are at out best, when we are at pace and moving it, setting good screens and getting second and third side when we need it, but with a good inside-outside attack. We came out, and I think that was very effective for us. We always want to try to get the ball to JJ. They bring a lot of congestion and we probably would have liked to put it in more cleaner in some areas but she demands so much attention down there. I thought the are best thing was obviously just getting on the boards. I think she was fantastic for us. And that's what we need. You know, some games you are going to get more touches than other games and shoot but it's more about playing in the right way and sharing the ball and good to great. I think shot selection wasn't great last game. So it's about making those adjustments and continue to play the way that we want to play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was thinking no, no, she's up -- no, no, she's going to shoot it. But a three-point shot is a layup for her. We encourage her to shoot all those threes. I know she missed one just before it. But I love the confidence that she brings. We talk about her being a rookie. She's not really a rookie. She has this experience in really big moments and the mindset to handle this atmosphere extremely well, and to make a play like that, I mean, I love it. She's an amazing player and an amazing human being."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, you know, I think kind of piggybacking off of the question that I answered from Pepper, it's understanding when I'm getting into the paint, the defense has to make a decision. They are either going to come and take me or they are going to play, you know two on one on the back side, and there's Leo and B in the corner, and as a defender, you just have to take your pick between the two. I was able to just drive in, look her off, and obviously B -- a corner three for B is a layup as well. She shoots that at a really high clip and really well. So I kind of baited Alanna Smith into thinking I was going to pass it high. And B hit a huge shot for us that changed the momentum of the game and continued to extended the lead. I think they called a time-out a little bit after that. It was huge for us. We believe in her. She knows that. This was a huge game. She played a huge role in the game ending up the way that it did and she's going to continue to do it for these next two games, we know that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I think we've been in these moments before on opposing court when it gets really, really loud, and it's more about making sure we stay true to who we are. We kind of know how we want to play. We know that they are going to make runs. We know the crowd is going to get into it. But we've just got to continue to play -- stay true to who the New York Liberty are, and if we can do that, we can overcome any obstacle."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"We have had great starts in both games, but I thought our -- how much they were talking in the huddle, you know, it wasn't just me talking all the time. They're going ""We have got to rebound. The possession game."" I just thought, when we play like that, with the pace that we went out and just the effort and the energy we put into the defensive side with the scramble and the help, good things happen. It was just more about staying persistent. We kept Minnesota to 27 points in that second half, that's pretty good. And some of our scramble defense, we were down 1-0. So you know, we should be playing like that. And now we can tidy up some things and they can tidy up some things as well, too. We'll look forward to playing another tough game on Wednesday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I mean, I think we embrace it. We like it when it's loud. We like it when it's difficult. You know, as we did tonight when it's so loud that you can't hear, you know, just expecting that when we go to Minnesota, hopefully it's going to be an incredible atmosphere for both of those games. But just continuing to stick together, and I think also, the biggest thing behind it is like not getting too high or too low, you know. Things are going to seem bigger than what they are because they are playing at home, and I'm sure Minnesota said the same thing when they are playing here. But yeah, we like to go on the road."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, obviously I stayed up watching the game, not too late laughter. But it was a nail-biter. But I mean, after they won the way that they did, today I was like, yeah, I'm going to wear my Oregon shoes because I wanted to embody that tough, gritty win that they pulled off, which is probably one of the biggest wins that our program has had there. A lot of things didn't go right for them and they just continued to fight and stay together and grind out a really big win. I was like, all right, I want to bring that energy with me today on the court and kind of do the same thing. So I think I'm going to wear the same shoes again on Wednesday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Lucky shoes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We are the first team in WNBA playoff history to be down 15 and come back and win the game. So that ranks really high. I think it defines our team in terms of being able to get through difficult times. That's what we say, we've been talking about, all these interviews we've been given, that's what we are talking about You have to be mentally tough and resilient. You have to look inward and not blame other people, and give each other confidence. And we were that team. You know, thrilled that we could hang in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I mean, he believes in us like we believe in ourselves. I think we have such a tight-knit circle with our families involved as well, and we all know what we can do in that. We never give up. He embodies all of our families. They all believe that we can come back and we can win and we can stay composed and hopefully win. The basketball gods were on our side tonight."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"Honestly, whatever the folks want to call me, I'm with whatever. As long as they're showing love. If you show me love, you can call me whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"That's just a testament to how we believe in each other. We have so many great three-point shooters, and the fact that these girls are out here trying to get me the ball, I mean, I could cry. This is amazing. I love it. I say that all the time, and I don't say that for fun. These people I'm around, we believe in each other so much. It's crazy, man. I'm happy to be here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"From a basketball standpoint, Courtney recognized that she had to get more aggressive. Not pick up her dribble. Her team needed her to be aggressive to go score the basketball. We needed some help. Phee got going as well. But Courtney has been around for a while. She has been in Finals games, and she knows her team needed her to get aggressive."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I think just taking it one possession at a time. We've been in situations where we've been down before, and that's when we really lean on our defense. That's something we were talking about, getting three stops in a row, chipping at it a little bit at a time. Not thinking about the point difference, but thinking about the possession that we need to get a stop and a score. That's just what we were talking about at halftime. Just every game, I try to go out and impact defensively. Especially when they are going on a run like that, they have amazing offensive players, and so trying to be as disruptive as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It just goes in preparation. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us and playing tendencies and just playing defense. Again, they are great offensive players. They are going to make plays. I just have to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I don't know where it ranks. It's 1 right now because we are here. I like to be where my feet are planted. So it's 1 right now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy she made a clutch free throw, if you go and look --"
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,Laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"That helped her a little bit, clutch free throws, that was good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I messed that up laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,I didn't feel that way. Those are your words.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We know it's a long series. Nothing is won in the first quarter. It was not the first quarter that we were hoping for. What our narrative was in the timeouts was just we had to find our footing. Find our footing defensively, and we did the second quarter. We held them to 12 after giving up 32. We went into halftime in good shape. No question about it, the second-chance points are really, really disappointing. That could have really cost us, and we were very, very fortunate that we overcame that. But defensively, we knew what we had to get done. Once our offense improved a little bit and we stopped turning the ball over. But they played terrific. I thought New York played terrific. Their pace was terrific. They run so many great things. They are unique in what they do. They found JJ repeatedly. She had a tremendous game. We had to overcome a lot. And then you look up at the end, and you know, we held them below 40 percent, which is monumental. A lot of that was obviously late. We got big stops when we needed them. Repeatedly, whether ball is going out of bounds or 5050 balls, referees, whatever happens, jump balls, fouls, all that stuff, we just had to be gritty at the end. We had to get stops to win and that's what I'm proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Well said. Alanna is one of our highest WARP players, if you're into analytics. She's one of our highest. You know, like you said, she's not going to wow you. She's not going to fly around, scoring the ball, making post moves. It's not her. But what she does for our team, both offensively and defensively, it's not underappreciated, I can tell you that. It's a little bit understated. People have to really watch to recognize what she does for us. Fighting through. Every night, she's playing against the opposing team's big, and she's not big. And so if you look at the success that she has in doing that, it's the reason why we're sitting here today in the Finals. She's Second Team All-Defense, along with Collier as Defensive Player of the Year. Those two are the heart and soul of our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"No, it is the margin. It is the margin. But I hear what you're saying, in that when it mattered, we got some hustle plays. And we always say, you never know which one is going to be the difference between winning and losing. That last possession, I think we learned from an earlier playoff game when we were down how we wanted to play that last possession. And so being aggressive and getting the three ball and do what we had to do, if one didn't go in, you know, get as many chances as we could get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"If the bigs weren't rebounding, might as well go small. Couldn't get any worse, right? What we wanted was a couple ball handlers, get downhill, try to get some easier stuff and pace, etc. That was actually, I don't know if it was Katie Smith or Rebekkah Brunson, but it was something that they asked for and it was a really good call."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it felt like we got a second chance. Obviously you don't want to be put in that position. Wish I wouldn't have fouled. Wish it wouldn't have been called, whatever it was. But yeah, you're not thinking about that in the second. You're just thinking making sure they didn't get the rebound, making sure we're boxing out and going to our next play. So yeah, that's what I was thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,I didn't know she was here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"She was texting to the bench. A lot of the good stuff we did, she was sending laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"The games that we were talking about, we were up. We were managing leads. We weren't finishing well. The fundamental difference is we were down. So obviously we finish games better when we're down, based on the playoffs. But that was what I was referring to, was managing leads better, playing all the way through to the end of the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Welcome to Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. I'm excited to be here in New York City as the Liberty take on the Minnesota Lynx. As you all know, the Liberty and Lynx were the two best teams in the WNBA all year, with both at the top of the standings for much of the season. The Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, are making their second straight Finals appearance and looking to win their first WNBA championship. Obviously, they won the Commissioner's Cup the other year 2023. The Lynx, one of the most decorated franchises in WNBA history, are looking to win a league-record fifth title and are appearing in a record seventh Finals. They're looking to become the second team to sweep both the Commissioner's Cup and the WNBA Finals trophy. With Napheesa having such a career year, along with the play in New York with Sabrina and Stewie and the storylines about Leonie Fiebich, her first year in the league, All-Rookie Team, and free-agency signings in Minnesota with Courtney Williams and Alanna Smith and so many more storylines, I'm just excited to get this tipped off. The Finals mark the culmination of what I think is the most transformational year in the WNBA's history. You saw all the statistics we put out viewership, attendance, merch sales, digital engagement at or near record levels. To put it in perspective with a few stats that bring insight into what has happened, the WNBA has significantly outpaced the industry in average consumption of live games in 2024. Fans watched 30 percent more minutes on average of each WNBA game in the 2024 regular season. Our games reached a record 54 million viewers in the 2024 regular season. Younger, more diverse audiences are imperative to the growth of the sports industry, and they flocked to the WNBA this season. Viewership by fans under 35 increased 211 percent, led by a 259 percent increase in viewership from Gen Z and millennial women. Our focus on our direct-to-consumer platforms led to record-breaking content consumption and repeated fan engagement. WNBA App downloads surpassed 1 million this year, and monthly active users skyrocketed 252 percent. Social engagement increased nearly 300 percent across all of our league channels. There was an astounding 872 percent increase in WNBA App story views, which I know I watch my kids watching all the little stories that we put out there. Last time we gathered for the Finals, in 2023, we had just announced the Golden State expansion franchise. Since then, we have announced two more expansion teams to begin play in 2026, Toronto and Portland, with one more team to begin play by no later than the 2028 season, to get us to 16 teams. This summer we signed a groundbreaking media rights deal that will grow the economics of our league and expand the reach and accessibility of our game for our fans, with additional WNBA media deals to come. As you know, early in the season, after seeing the growth trajectory we were on and with a challenging game footprint given the Olympics, we implemented full charter flights for the entire season plus playoffs. This growth has not come without growing pains. The hateful speech and threats directed at our players are troubling. That type of conduct is not representative of the WNBA's character or fan base. As a league, we stand united in condemning racism and all forms of hate. The WNBA is one of the most inclusive and diverse professional sports leagues in the world, and we will continue to champion those values. We'll meet with the Players Association, the players, teams. We'll work together to expand and enhance our efforts and are going to approach this multidimensionally, utilizing technology, prioritizing mental health, reinforcing physical security and increasing monitoring. We know there's more work to be done, and as a league, we are fully committed to listening to the players and other stakeholders on this and other important issues. Finally, before we get to your questions, we have some news to announce Starting next year with the 2025 WNBA season, the WNBA Finals presented by YouTube TV will be a best-of-seven format, replacing the current best-of-five format. The Finals will take on a 2-2-1-1-1 structure, in which the team with the higher seed will host Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, and its opponent will host Games 3, 4 and 6. This will give our fans a championship series format that they are accustomed to seeing in other sports. We will also be changing our first round to a 1-1-1 setup for the best-of-three series. We have contemplated both these changes since the pandemic. We would have done it in the current year, but with the Olympic break this year, it wasn't possible. But now that we have charters throughout the season and playoffs, it's feasible. So to summarize, in 2025 we will have a best-of-three first round, five in the semifinals and seven in the WNBA Finals. In addition, the 2025 regular season will increase from 40 to 44 games per team. Honestly, the league's growth and increased demand for WNBA basketball made this the ideal time to expand the schedule, lengthen the Finals and provide fans more opportunities to see the best players in the world compete at the highest level. I also want to take the opportunity to let you know that the WNBA Draft Lottery 2025 presented by State Farm will be broadcast on Sunday, November 17, at 5 p.m. Eastern on ESPN. With that, I want to thank you for your coverage this year. It really has made a difference. I really am very grateful to be standing here as the commissioner of a league that has been through so much. To have you all in this room and reporting on this league as you have all year, very grateful for that. With that, happy to answer any questions."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, first of all, there's no place in sports for this. Just continue to condemn it, continue to be a voice on this. Also, I think we have been already meeting with some technology providers. I think there are some technology solutions out there that we could deploy and employ. Of course, we want to meet with the players and see what they want to do around that. But there are some technology companies we've been meeting with to see what we can do. It just is something where we have to continue to be a voice for this, a voice against it, condemning it, and making sure that we find every opportunity to support our players, who have been dealing with this for much longer than this year, by the way. I think Sue Bird said that the other day very eloquently. We need to continue to see how we can support the mental health resources, physical security, cybersecurity. We're going to attack it, as I said, multidimensionally. We're going to try to figure out how we can best work with the players as to how they want us to help solve this issue."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, well, next year we do not have any international competition. No FIBA World Cup and no Olympic break, so we should have a nice footprint. It's hard to start much earlier because we obviously have the college season. The college draft is such a great feeder system into the WNBA and creates a lot of excitement, as you've seen over the past few years and probably since the league started. I think probably not starting much earlier. Certainly we're well into October by the time we finish the Finals, especially if we go to five games this year, next year seven. So we'll probably go a little bit later in October. But again, we'll have a decent footprint next year to fit in the 44. Remember, we have an additional team joining next year, in Golden State Valkyries. So I think it'll be great. We'll have obviously the condensed Commissioner's Cup a few weeks, culminating in that championship, as well. I think next year will be a good footprint. We'll have to look at the following year because that is the FIBA World Cup year. Obviously, we'll be good in 2027, and then it'll be LA '28. It's a constant balancing of the schedule. I think we feel very good about where we'll be next year, for sure, on the footprint."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"So that date in November was draft lottery, not the draft. Yes. The Golden State Valkyries will pick fifth in each round. The lottery picks will be the four teams that you probably have already done the calculations on, but we'll obviously put a release out after this press conference on exactly that, and then the Golden State Valkyries will have the fifth pick in each round."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's a good question on what's next as it relates to our globalization platform. Obviously, we played Toronto, we played in Edmonton. That was kind of our Canada series. Now we'll have a team in Toronto starting in '26. Sure, we'd like to play in more places -- EMEA, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America, I know Mexico City has shown interest, as well as a variety of other cities across the world. Obviously, I was in Paris for the Olympics this year. Thought it was amazing, the support for women's basketball there. I'll never forget on the Friday night when Belgium played France in the women's game. I'd say that was the best crowd that I saw watch a game there. Obviously, a lot of Belgians could drive there to Paris. It was great to see the growth of the game globally. I think our players represent such great role models to those communities in lifting women. I've admired what the NBA has done with their Global Games platform, playing around the world. I think we'll be on a path there as we get into 2025 and beyond."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"That will be something I'm sure in collective bargaining that we'll sit down with the players and Players Association. I think one thing that you noticed in the last year or two, particularly this year, a lot of our veterans were in camp, training camp. Obviously, they have to show up by May 1, and I think it was important. I think you saw the quality of the game in the first few weeks because of that. I also think you saw the quality of the Commissioner's Cup play, which is toward the front half of the season to give that some more relevance. Again, I'm sure it'll be something we continue to discuss and talk about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so again, we work with FIBA. We're working with all the constituents on how we can make this all work, where they can have vibrant, competitive seasons. We can have our vibrant, competitive season. Obviously, some have moved their dates to end earlier to make sure that those vets -- remember, our prioritization rule does not apply to rookies in their first couple years, but for those vets to come over and play in the best league in the world. But we have a good relationship with FIBA. Working through with them. And again, I think in 2025 -- that's another impediment to starting earlier, to the question about starting earlier, not only the college draft and college season going into the beginning of April, we need to have a training camp, but also the Euro leagues, as well, play into April now, into May. I think on balance, I think we all want to grow the game globally. I think it's going to come down to footprints and seasons and how we can do it, which is why most of what we're doing in expanding our season will be on the back end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, absolutely. We're always scenario planning around a variety of different outcomes. Certainly, I engage with Nneka and Terri throughout the year, every month, every other week during the season. I really respect the player leadership. I think this is going to be an opportunity to listen to one another and take this league to the next level for generations to come. I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players. We actually look forward to engaging in that now that we've kind of gotten the media deal we discussed, corporate partners, just everything. There's virtually not a sporting event you can turn on where one of our players is not in an ad spot. That was not happening five years ago. Look at Aliyah Boston and Sabrina and A'ja and so many of our players in these ad spots. I think that's a good sign, too, as we think about the future of this game and the future of the agreement between the Players Association and the owners."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, one thing that as a very long-term sports fan I know is that officiating and refereeing is always at the top of the fan's list, of the media's list. Obviously, we work hard on training. We work hard on consistency. Obviously, not every -- they're humans. Looking at technology, basketball is a little more complex than tennis, for instance, around technology, of officiating. We're looking at a variety of different dimensions, but we'll continue training. We have a lot of veteran officials. You'll see them out here working the Finals. But we always know there's always work to do, always get better. We review in our Competition Committee meetings, officiating and points of emphasis and things like that. We'll caucus with Bethany Donaphin, our head of league operations, and our referee operations, as well. We'll caucus to make sure we're putting out the best officiating we can. But I know it's a passionate issue. Every fan group -- I love when I go into market and every fan group I meet with, they usually wait and ask it as the last question of the night. But they do ask about officiating, which I appreciate the passion for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"So on your first question, we do hear from NBA players who are very interested in investing in WNBA teams. There's a lot of capital inflow coming into women's sports, as many of you are hearing and reading, and obviously we were one of the first and only to raise at the scale we did, 75 million back in 2022. We brought in former NBA players into that capital raise and former WNBA players into that capital raise. So yes, we do get interest from time to time. Now, the NBA investments by those players is in independent teams, not in NBA-affiliated teams. So if you're still playing for an NBA team, you probably want to invest in the WNBA team with your affiliate, and you can't do that until you graduate, I'll call it, or retire from basketball. So we have a lot of interest from that perspective. Then again, we want to listen to the players as to how they want to think about anything that we go to the bargaining table on, whether that's equity stakes or other issues that they might be interested in. We're certainly willing to listen. I think it is complicated when you have a Players Association versus the league versus the owners who are all small businesses, right. Well, 13, now we'll have 15 to 16, and they're each individual businesses. I think it's a little more complicated because there's no one equity stake. Like Unrivaled, it is one league with equity stake in, and it's not teams. We've got 12, soon to be 16, teams in a league. So it's a little more complicated, I think."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that we look at for all of our teams every year, as well as you mentioned the expansion teams. I think my comments on the expansion teams were you want to make sure the expansion owners know, when you come into the league, it's a competitive league. Free agency is competitive now, and all of our owners are investing. You see investing in practice facilities and other player experiences. I think we want those expansion teams to come in and be the most successful they can. I think, you may have a different view, but I think our current owners are all growing in the same direction as far as how they know they need to get free agents to build a championship squad. Obviously great rookies, too, become veterans later on. I don't have a bias against any one team. Obviously, we have teams playing in different size arenas. You saw some teams upgrade those arenas for certain games this year, and I thought that was a sign and signal that as has attendance had a grown across the league that we can play in bigger arenas. I think when I came into this league, someone said you should all be playing in 5,000-seat arenas. Can you imagine what you're going to see out here tonight if that was in a 5,000-seat arena? No, there's going 17,000-plus people here. And we had our highest-attended game ever, over 20,000, in Washington this year. I think we do have standards, by the way, across the board for facilities, practice facilities and things like that. The owners now know that there's an edge to showing a player investment in the things like facilities, et cetera, especially practice facilities. I was in Phoenix for the All-Star Game this year taking a tour of their new practice facilities that they opened. Vegas has done it, Seattle has done it, Dallas is going to do it. I think Phoenix I mentioned, and Chicago is looking at upgrading. I think all of our -- we already had some great practice facilities already in the league in Indy, Minnesota, et cetera, and here in New York. I think, again, there's no -- we do have standards, but there's nothing where we're saying any one owner is not up to their standards today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so just in general for the 16th spot, as I've mentioned, the good news is we have a lot of demand from many cities. I'd say 10 or so, maybe even plus at this point, because I think the more people are watching the WNBA and seeing what we're growing here and seeing these players and the product on the court, more people are interested in having it in their cities. They see the economic impact of having a WNBA team in their city, the role model in the community these players represent. So I've said Philly is on the list, and Philly is on the list. Now that we have the three teams, two in '26, one next year, we're not in a huge rush. We'd like to bring it in in '27 or no later than '28, as I mentioned. So I'd say there's 10 to 12 cities that are very viable that we're evaluating, and we have a process. I'd say I don't have a deadline by which we have to name it because it'll be out to '27 or '28, but I would think in the next couple months or so we'll start -- now as we get into the offseason, we'll start taking a look at those that will go to the top of the list through our process. Again, it's all the same types of things I've been talking about for the other three around arena, practice facility, player experience, committed long-term ownership group, city, demographics, psychographics, Fortune 500 companies based there. All the things we've been looking at in all of our cities and our data analysis. And then we've built some good relationships with some of the potential cities as they've started to engage with the league on an expansion team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think if you look at the diversity of when we did our capital raise, you'll see a fair amount of diversity in the ownership group we brought in there, investor group. Obviously, we talk with our owners all the time about diversity in the coaching ranks, in their front office, back office, et cetera. You see every year we score very well in our report on that. We have a lot of assistant coaches that have been previous WNBA players and represent a very diverse group, as well. We have all of our owners partnering with minority-owned businesses. We partner at the league with Mielle, who is one of our newer partners. Playa Society. I think one of our teams just got a Partake Foods jersey patch that's a minority-owned business. We're looking at it from all these angles, partnerships, ranks of our employee base and certainly the coaching diversity and coaching, as well. So it is important to us. There's not a Board of Governors meeting that we don't talk about this. As you know, we've made enormous progress especially in the assistant coaching ranks with former WNBA players by essentially focusing on this over the last couple years. Made enormous progress, which is why our report card is really good. But it's something that you can never rest on, so I appreciate the question. We've had a couple coaches exit, so I think we have three open coaching spots. Obviously, the Golden State Valkyries announced their first head coach in their franchise history today. We have three open coaching spots. So we'll certainly be looking for our owners to have a diverse pool of candidates, and ultimately they'll make the decision on their head coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"We just take it on the chin, you know. We were up a lot and then we had a wild kind of sequence to end the fourth. Didn't start overtime great. I had a great look at the end and I didn't make it. But I think that this is a series. We wanted to really win, obviously, for home court. But the beauty is, we have another game on Sunday and we'll be ready."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, it's probably a lot of things. I could probably give you a better answer tomorrow. I just thought we went away from our principles of play. I think we had a great first quarter, and then they lifted up the energy and they outhustled us. I think we forced some of the action. We weren't moving it good enough. We couldn't get downhill as much. You know, we missed a lot of shots. We missed a lot of shots. Just the principles of play for us. How we want to play, get to the next action. But look, defensively, I think they executed better than us. That's what it came down to. They executed better than us. They found a way to win. They made some big shots, timely shots when they needed to. We're disappointed. We have to be better. We're a better team than what we showed today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think it's pretty clear, JJ had an amazing game, and the way that she was aggressive from start to finish is exactly what we need. I think that we got a lot of looks. Like, 90 shots is a lot, and we missed them. I think just coming out and understanding the game plan a little bit better, and always being on our front foot. I felt like there was just a few situations, time and score toward the end of the game, that really hurt us. But collectively there's a lot of things that you could kind of look at and be like, well, this is one of the reasons why we lost."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they took us out of what we wanted to run. They were really aggressive. They were blowing up stuff. We couldn't get clear passes. We tried to go downhill and they would stunt and get back, and we just got a little bit stagnant. Then we had obviously -- I thought we were slow. We were up so you're trying to move the ball, but then we are slow in our speed, execution speed, and then it was making it easy for them. And they made plays. They made plays down the other end. Obviously we contested it -- we give them a three, a four-point play. Those things, they can break your back, and they did. We had our opportunities to win and we didn't finish it. We're disappointed. We have to go back to work. We have to freshen up. We have to look at how we can be better, and it's really just principles of play. Things that we have been great at all season long, we have to just refocus on them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think the missed free throw because we had an opportunity to go up one. But even still, at the end of overtime, I had probably one of my cleanest looks. Didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"I mean, they switched with us a little bit more to stop us from going downhill. I don't know, I think the weight of the game was more about us, like Sandy said, getting away from our principles versus what they did to kind of get us out of rhythm."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they were throwing different coverages at her, with the switching and she was trying to go probably a little bit too much one-on-one early. We've just got to move the ball and trust that the ball will come back to her in that regard and exploit it. We had a tough night. We had a tough shooting night. We all did. But what I know, Sabrina is a competitor. She'll get ready for Game 2 and come back strong."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I want to be taking these shots. I feel like knowing my teammates and that everyone has confidence in me is important. It's kind of like on to the next and still making sure I'm aggressive any time on the court. Obviously as a player, it's very frustrating. But bounce back for Game 2."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"It was a point of emphasis for us coming into the game, just to control the rebounding and really get on the boards and try to exploit them in that way. It's something that we're going to have to continue to do to be successful. But like Stewie and Coach said, we had a lot of opportunities to close the game out. A few things that we have to change and kind of be aware of moving forward, but still some things to build upon and things to learn from."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, a hundred percent. It's principles of plays at both ends. Being at the point of the screen, Kayla McBride is coming off and shooting it, and then letting them go downhill, pressuring and letting Hiedeman dribble by us and giving them too many easy looks where we should have been just a little bit smarter in our defense there. Sometimes when we didn't rebound or we kind of -- we went to offensive rebound but we are out of position and they got easy layups in transition. So those really break your back. Principles of play in the half court. Pace is there, but I think we got a little stagnant and a little tired. But credit to them. They were blowing us up and they were being really physical. They were very active. They were switching it, and then that took us out of it a little bit. We've got to be better and we will be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think it's, specifically to that play because they were reviewing the time, you're just focusing on making the shot. Making the first one. Making the first one. Making the first one. And then the second one, the same. It's when you want to be thinking about nothing else. It definitely sucks to miss."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,I think just the start we did have. We put up 32 points. We were very intentional playing defense. We were making it really hard for them to score. Some easy baskets. We were making shots and moving the ball really quick. But they went to another level. So they kind of took us out of a rhythm. Not surprised us. We knew what they are capable of doing. But we've got to get back and just play Liberty basketball.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely a little bit anxious. A little bit nervousness in there, just because I had no idea where I was going. I kind of told my agent to keep it a secret from me. I just want to be surprised. For me, I just wanted to land somewhere that would develop me and kind of make me into the best basketball that I can be. I'm happy that I landed with Utah. Definitely excited. Felt relief when I heard my name called, so that's probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I think the biggest way I fit in is just my versatility. When you come in at such a young age, and being able to play multiple positions and guard multiple positions, I really feel like that allows you to fit in with the dynamic of the team just because you can do so much and fit in with different needs. That's the biggest part. There's a lot of talented guys on that team. I could go down the list and do their whole lineup that I can fit in with. But the biggest thing is they are young and I could develop and learn with them and kind of build that young core. That's probably the part I'm most excited about with this team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Just being himself really. I feel like that's how he differentiates himself on and off the court and really made a name for himself. Being himself includes not only his personality but also his work ethic and how hard he worked to get to where he is and where he is going to continue to go to. I feel like just taking those aspects of his game and his mentality, how he approached every workout, every rep, every charity event, every media coverage, I feel like I can use that and take that with me and use it throughout my career. That's how I'm going to grow and develop."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now. It's something we dreamed about. As kids, obviously we never really got to play against or with each other on the same team just because of the age difference. So I think being able to do that now is definitely a dream come true. I'm going to make sure I'm matched up on him when we're playing them. Make sure, tell Will, put me on Jalen Williams. That's the game plan."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I think it just goes to show the type of parents I have and the type of people I have in my life and my family members, just the values they installed in both of us. That's why we ended up this way. So I know they are extremely proud watching us reach our dreams. That's the biggest thing for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"We practiced it a lot, I'm not going to lie. Two years ago, we messed it up. We were practicing for a few days, maybe even a week up until this point, to make sure we nailed it. Add a little flair to it. So we made up for it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I've just got baby steps into the fashion industry, I'm not going to lie to you. This is the first time I stepped out and wore something expensive. I think for me it might be something a little hobby I'll pick up, but I'm just starting to get into fashion and just starting to figure it out. I'll probably learn from him as I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, it's hard to say just because we play two different styles of basketball. I don't know what your definition of better is. I hope to become an elite two-way player, playing offense and defense and doing that at the highest level and being one of those elite two-way players in the NBA, as I go throughout my career. Yeah, I strive to be better than him. Obviously a little sibling rivalry, but we also play like completely different just with the way our bodies are built. So you know, that's the answer you're looking for."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely gaming. I would say gaming, for sure, is one of the biggest ones. Fashion, stepping into it a little bit. I'm a huge movie guy. That's something I always been into. Just pick up a movie and watch it. I love cinematography, so that's definitely probably the biggest one. I like bowling and starting to pick up golf too. Have a lot more free time, so I can start getting good at golf and getting a routine for it. But definitely bowling is another activity I'm heavy on."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, probably. And a lot of family time. That's probably going to be a heavy dose of it, spend as much time as I can with friends and family, while also obviously staying locked in on basketball. But enjoying the moments with them before the season gets hectic and I'm going to be traveling all over the place."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, go to this afterparty. That's probably the biggest thing. I'm looking forward to enjoying that. Got all my closest friends and family there. I guess that's on my bucket list to enjoy."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"It was a surreal feeling. I mean, especially just sitting in that chair waiting, just to figure out which team was going to get me. For them to pick me, a lot of emotions were just going through me. I'm definitely blessed."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"All of them are hardworking. They push their players past their limits. I feel like that's the best place for me. Especially with me going there, I know they are going to push me past my limits, push me past that wall to be the best player that I can be and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"Well, like you said, they have their trust in Bam. So I feel like once they have trust with me, it comes with me showing them that in practice. I feel like that's something that would elevate my game, just having that trust in me that I go out and make the right plays."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"A lot of people go into the transfer portal for money. I went in there for the right fit and I found the right fit. That definitely helped my career.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, I think the more I develop, I'll definitely be able to initiate offense at the one. Played two and three before. I think playing in the NBA, playing around in practice, I think I'll start to get used to it more, and then I think I can really take that role to the next level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JA'KOBE WALTER,"I've never been to Toronto. I've never even been to Canada. But I know that it's a nice city in Canada, and all I really know is the building."

I'm just super grateful to be in this position and I hope that I'm going to represent Baylor well."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, it was great. But I had injuries, so sadly, I didn't play more. But I tried to take my time and to be with them, to talk with them, even with the injury. So yeah, I really enjoyed it there. I made some really good friends and friendships forever.

And of course, Durisic, Nikola and I got really close this year. I really enjoyed playing with him. It was easy, as I can say. I hope he will get drafted as high as possible. It meant a lot that I had him here. We were together in Miami. We shared some good memories at times. We visit some places. It's great to have him here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",NIKOLA TOPIC,"Not yet. I've been coming back slowly. But we'll talk tomorrow with the team and the team doctor and see what's the best for me, and we'll do that."

Having my family with me at the table, my coach, my agent, having my family in the crowd, I couldn't ask for anything else. It was my mom's birthday today, so that's an awesome thing to celebrate as well. I'm at a loss for words. I'm super happy to be here and super thankful."

I was saying that I wanted to contribute to -- I want to be a part of a winning team and contribute to winning and compete. For that, I say that I was ready to do whatever it takes to do it.

Trying to understand what Victor, Rudy or other French players really help me to develop myself as a player, first of all, in France, and hopefully now in the NBA."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I'm not shocked. I'm not shocked. I've known Tidjane and Alex for a long time. We grew up playing against each other. So I know them really well. Like I said, that's amazing for our country. That's amazing for us, first of all. Just to be able to realize our dream together is special. I feel like French players are going to take some inspiration, and that's going to be better and better for us. I really feel lucky because there's so many young players that are good. That's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I'm a versatile player. I feel like I can fit easily into this team. I can't wait to figure out what is going to be my role or my goals, or, you know, just to make sure we win games. So I don't know yet, but I know that I can do a lot of things. Defend multiple positions, grabbing some rebounds, finishing strong, being aggressive, shooting threes obviously. I think that's going to be -- that's a part of my game. That's something that I need to keep it up for helping the team to win the next season, because I know that we are going to have to shoot the ball. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"For now, I just want -- I just know the facilities of the Hawks. I can't wait to get in there and to just work in those conditions. I think that's a style of life that I'm not used to. I talk about the gym, the cold baths, locker room, whatever. I feel like if I could basically sleep in the gym. In Bourg-en-Bresse, which is a great gym, too, but not as good as the Hawks have. I can really sleep in the gym."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",YVES MISSI,"The workout went well. It was probably one of my favorite ones, actually. I just really liked the coaching staff and the organization in general. I had an opportunity to spend time with them, and just being able to talk with them and interact with them. They just talked about the plan and what they are thinking about next year, and then what they are looking for in a big. And then obviously the workout, they gave me some advice on how to get better. I just love the organization, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",YVES MISSI,"I haven't been playing basketball that long. I'm still learning each and every day, every time I step on the court. Obviously, I wasn't ranked and it wasn't something I was paying attention to. To be honest, I was trying to have fun on the court. Obviously, brought me from Cameroon all the way to here. You never know where the basketball can take you. Just being here is amazing. It's a blessing and I have to thank God to be able to put me in this position."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",YVES MISSI,"Oh, for sure. According to everyone, they have the best food in the U.S. I remember going on my visit, I really liked it. I can't wait to get to know them a little bit more and just spend time with them on the team and just get to work, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Not really. I feel like my game is dissected very much so, whether it's being non-athletic, non-defender. So it's something I take as a challenge. I'm used to it by now, going to the biggest platform at Duke. You get used to it. I'm just excited to embrace the challenge and embrace the process and have fun with it. It's a blessing to even be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm just excited to learn from him, learn from both Maxey and him. Obviously they are elite scorers, so I think I can space the floor and create space for them. I'm excited to get to know them and learn as much as possible from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm excited. Obviously Maxey, I've heard great things about him. Watching him on the court, he's an elite player. Being able to play alongside him and learn from him. On draft night, there's surprises everywhere. So I didn't know where I was going. I tried not to get attached to any teams. So yeah, I guess it is a surprise, but I'm happy to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Not yet. I sent Maxey my number, and I got to talk to the GM, the coach. Not too much. But I'm excited to get to know them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I think it's my natural emotion, is just to be happy, be joyful. So there's no reason to change that when I'm on the court. I'm always going to embrace the challenge, obviously, but I'm going to have fun with it. Whether I make a three, make a good play, the team is excited, the crowd is excited. I'm going to be smiling probably no matter what. So it's something I bring everywhere I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"I'd say my why is I feel like I've been underrated my whole entire life ever since I was coming out of high school. I've always had a chip on my shoulder, and to this day I'll always have that chip on my shoulder to go out there and prove people wrong."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, I would say to all the kids out there that don't have offers, you don't have to be the highest-rated kid in your class or whatever. You could always go junior college or whatever type of route and be different. You can make your own path and find your way."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"It feels great, to play with one of the greats to ever touch a basketball. It's going to be exciting to go put on a show for L.A."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, like you said, AD is there. I get to learn from one of the greatest in LeBron and AD to help me each step of the way on both sides of the floor. I'm excited just to go out there and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"Learning how to take care of my body constantly. I would say that's the biggest thing I was focusing on, and just kind of being around those type of NBA guys that have been there and done that. So just kind of learning from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"I would say it's a mixture. I was just trying to be the best version of myself, and try to always push myself to be better and be better than yesterday."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, I remember that clip. I woke up and rolled out of bed and I thought it was fake because tons of people were texting me. I was just like, there's no way."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, that's really exciting. At Tennessee, I watched a lot of JJ Redick with Coach Barnes. Just the way he moves and paces himself, and was able to create space. So hearing that, it's going to be really exciting and really special."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"I would just say playing with a chip on my shoulder. Every single time I touch a basketball or walk into a gym, I always feel like I've got something to prove. It doesn't matter where I'm at. It's always going to be there, having that chip on my shoulder, feeling like I've been underrated for my whole life. It's something I'm going to carry with me the rest of my career."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,"A hundred percent. I feel like there's no feeling like it. Just having all the people that have been a part of your journey since the beginning and seeing you grow. I feel like there's nothing like having them here with me and experiencing this with me and supporting me. There's no feeling like it, honestly."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,"No, a hundred percent. I'm super proud of myself just sticking through that Australian season, knowing things were not going my way but continue to believe in myself every single day, and keep taking steps and getting better and looking at the bigger picture of my career. I feel like it's a great experience of being out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like Milwaukee was one of my best workouts I had. Even in the interviews at the combine and stuff like that, the interviews went really well. They just seemed like they had my best interests and they really liked me. So yeah, I kind of felt a little bit like Milwaukee would be the team that would want me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,"I would say that you just got to sometimes really just pop out and just show people, for real. You've just got to not want to duck or be scared. Believe in yourself more than anything and show people all the hard work that you've been putting in and the vision that you see and just put it out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like him coming in the tenth game of the season for us as a team and giving us a lot of freedom and a lot of trust, I feel like it really helped our team as a whole just play better in general with the players we had. He was a big part of our team's success, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,There's no feeling like it. It's surreal to me. Trying to soak it in. But it's truly a blessing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,"Like I said before, it's just really truly a blessing to have players that you're really close with that are at the level that you want to be at and are doing the things that you want to do on the court. Just to have them to pick their brains and receive advice that they are giving me, I feel like it's truly a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DaRON HOLMES II,"Yeah, it's all in the process there. The coaches there, the people are just amazing. Dayton does a great job of giving you the right pathway. It's all up to you if you choose to believe in that or not. So they did that with me, Toumani Camara, Obi Toppin and all the guys before that. I decided to choose and I believe in it, and I'm here where I am now because of that. Very grateful for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DaRON HOLMES II,"It was pretty cool. Great to see those players and a lot of great talent in there. I'm just happy to be where I'm at. Perfect fit. I'm very excited. I was excited the whole time. A little nervous. Great to see all my boys there watching me, but it's just great to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DaRON HOLMES II,"Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Great fit. I saw something that I get free nuggets from Wendy's. That's pretty cool. Other than that, I'm excited to get out there and play. It's a great team and a great organization for a reason. I'm going to get better and keep going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DaRON HOLMES II,"Probably an inhaler because I heard that -- what's it called, the altitude? I'm playing. I'll be all right. Honestly, I don't know. I'm just going to embrace it all and just be ready for it. I'm excited."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"It means a lot coming from that program. Knowing that program just got shut down and I was the last bunch of that. Definitely taught me a lot on and off the court, really a lot of the things about life and being mentally healthy and just learning how the NBA operates. On the court, this might be surprising to say, but all the losing that we did, I definitely learned a lot more than if we would have won a lot. I think that definitely prepared me a lot for the NBA because you're going to go through a lot of things with the NBA. It's going to be a lot of things that you need to be able to talk about or just have an outlet to and just being able to figure things out quickly just to move on to the next."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"I'm looking forward to changing things around. I know they have a stigma on them when it comes to a lot of losing, and I feel like I'm a huge part to be able to start to change that around. I have a willingness to win and I feel like me going into this franchise, being able to help them out with this good group of guys, good group of young guys that they have, I'm definitely super excited to get down there and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"I appreciate all the love and support you've given me throughout the whole season, and I'm finally here and I wouldn't be here without y'all. Like I said, I really appreciate all the love and support and all the competitive people in the G League. I appreciate y'all. It was a huge honor being able to play, going straight out of high school. I'm definitely blessed and honored to be in the situation I'm in."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"What excites me is really the basketball portion of it, for sure. I heard you have a huge fan base when it comes to basketball, so that's definitely something I'm looking forward to getting into. I'm a huge community guy, so I definitely see myself getting into that community as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"I would say just talk to everybody that has been with me throughout this whole process and really sit down and tell them how thankful I am for that. I've been through so much. Just being able to be here, blessed with this opportunity God has put me in. I'm super thankful for everyone who has been part of my journey. Once I tell them that, everything will be said and done and I'll be on my way to Detroit, and get settled in and have a good one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well. That's going to go a long way. That's going to be super exciting matchups here in the future soon. Like I said, I'm just super proud of him and I'm super excited for him."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KYSHAWN GEORGE,Just enjoying the moment with my family and grateful and very happy that my name got called.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KYSHAWN GEORGE,"They are expecting hard work. Obviously, I can provide that. Just overall, like I said before, my versatility, shooting ability, spacing the floor and how smart I am with the ball."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"Everything that I thought of came to life. Flashbacks from when I was young. Just dreaming of being in this position, walking across that stage in my mind. Hearing my name be called and walk across the stage today, it all came true. It was just God gave me this to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"It helped me a lot. That program at Lu High was probably the best decision I made, to go for my two years' program. I'm forever grateful to Coach John Buck and Coach Josh Corbin to give me an opportunity to play there. Their practices are like college practices. So I was prepared to go into that. Just having the competitive mindset helped me a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"I think it was Coach Bennett. I wasn't really known as a good defender coming out of high school. Once I got to UVA and had my growth spurt, I think I got some God-given talents. Coach Bennett drilled that mindset in me, and I was able to take off at Virginia."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"I'm excited. I'm excited. Great program. They want to win a championship and they have got great players to do it. I'm going to try to get down there, go to work and see what I've got to do to get there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"Yeah, I think I can. It's just getting a lot of reps in practice and everything like that. Just getting the confidence and just let it go. That's what I'm going to try to do in Phoenix, is be in the gym a lot. Just do what I've got to do as a team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,I am. Born and raised.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"It's crazy because he lives in Arizona as well. We are both going to be in the same state again living together. It's going to be good. Being from New York representing not only as two athletes but as brothers in different sports, it's amazing and I'm grateful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,He's actually in Arizona. That's where he's staying. He's rehabbing on that.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"He's not with a team, but he's going to start throwing for a team soon."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's just a blessing, for real, to even be here because you work your whole life and you never know if you're going to make it. So when you finally get there, it's just a blessing. Yeah, playing with Anthony Edwards and the whole Timberwolves. They were in the Western Conference Finals. So it's really just a blessing because I get to learn from a lot of players and veterans and players that are real good. Them helping me is just a plus for me. I didn't really get to work out with them, but I used to see Ant at Overtime Elite a lot, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them. I'd say it's a blessing to even be here in this situation. I thank the Timberwolves, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"I would say the open space on the floor. There's so much open floor, and I feel like I'm quick so I can get past dudes. It's really the fact of me getting past dudes and making decisions. You're playing with a bunch of NBA players, so players can't really help off super a lot because these are NBA players and they knock down shots. I feel like, for me, getting past my defender and making plays for my teammates will be way easier, and then if they don't help, then it's just a bucket."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like it would be easier. Once I know the assignment and what my coach wants me to do, it's not really me adjusting. It's just me doing what he says. I feel like anything Coach tells me to do, I can adjust to and I can make it happen. So I feel like it's a good feel, for real."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball. Me seeing Reed, my roommate, he's a great dude. He always pushed me and he always helped me. Me seeing him and we going together, it's just crazy to even see, and I'm thankful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,"Honestly, the workout went pretty well. I knew they were interested, but until the last minute, I didn't know where I was going. I'm very excited to start working. I can't wait."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,No. I'm planning on playing here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,"Obviously, I talked to the people over there. I got to learn more about the team. I was in the facility, everything. They showed me around. It was nice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,"I think it's beautiful. I took a lot of risk. I left France when I was 17. So I did the last two years in Germany. I felt like it was a risk, and I believed in myself. I worked a lot and stayed confident."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,"Yeah, it's kind of crazy. I played with everybody. It's nice seeing your country being one of the most represented in the NBA. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of everybody. The French people that went to the NBA, it's big. It's coming from a different continent. We have to really work to get there. Yeah, I'm really proud of everybody."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,"First, I would definitely say my brother, six years older. He was already playing basketball. But my first favorite player was probably KD."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,"I think I'm really versatile, but I can also bring what a rookie needs to bring in a team. Bring some energy. Being able to grab a rebound, push the ball but also knock down shots. I think it's very important for a rookie to bring these things."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",PACOME DADIET,"I don't know anybody personally on the team. But I talked with the coach, yeah. And yeah, it was nice to see him. I'm used to seeing him on TV. It was a little different, but I enjoyed it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I feel like I fit in great. I'm going to make sure that I get myself adjusted to whatever the team needs, whatever the players on that team need for us to be successful. With my high IQ and my versatility, I feel like there's a lot of different spots that I can fill and a lot of different needs I can address."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Basketball IQ, for sure. Making the right reads. Making smart plays. Being in the right position. I feel like that's very underrated, being in the right position and reading your defender. That's a lot of my game where I get my advantages from. I'm going to continue it do that, and I feel like that's going to help everybody else on the floor as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Right, to the efficiency point. I feel like that's huge for me, just because I like to play the right way. I feel like me playing the right way is me getting good shots, whether that's open shots or good layups at the rim. I feel like I'm just reading the game and adjusting to whatever the defense does. When I get a good look, it's more prone to go in than not. And then to your other point, hopefully we'll make it three. That would be really historic. Yeah, Colorado is not looked at as a draft pick-producing university like these other programs are. But if you look at the history, there's a lot of really, really solid players that have stuck around a long time in the league. It's just a testament to what Coach Boyle and his coaching staff have done at Colorado."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I'm excited to get to know them even more. We've got mutual friends. I've met them for the first time this past summer when my brother was playing on the national team and I went up there to Berlin to watch one of the games. But great people. They know my brother more than they know me, but they have already reached out to me through mutual friends. They make it very comforting to come to Orlando."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I talked with him earlier today, or tonight. I'm super excited, just learning from one of the great coaches. I feel like there's a lot that I can expand my game in, and I can't wait to learn even more. I feel like talking basketball and talking basketball IQ is one of my passions, as well, in the game. I'm just super excited to soak up all that knowledge and kind of grow."

As a freshman, for him to come in and do what he did, help lead that team to another national title, is something very hard to do as a freshman. I love that kid to death. I'm extremely happy for him, and I'll be his biggest fan this year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it's been a crazy two years, from winning one national title to winning the Big East regular season to the Big East Tournament and then winning another national title. A lot of winning, a lot of succeeding the past two years. I feel like I'm going to keep that chip on my shoulder and go into Portland with just a lot of confidence, with a willingness to learn and get better every single day. I just want to have an impact and try to help this organization win and get to the top and try to win championships."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm really excited. I feel the connection with some of these young guys I've watched since I was in high school. Scoot Henderson, in particular. I feel like we have a chance to do something really special. I'm young. Having a young team, just growing up around the same age, everyone learning and getting better every day, I'm really excited. I feel like I'm at a loss for words right now. I don't even know what else to say. I'm just excited and extremely blessed for this opportunity, and I'm really ready to get to Portland and get to work."

I feel like I can handle the ball at the top of the key, pass the ball at a high level and I can shoot the ball at a high level. One thing about me is I want to be a great teammate. I want to be the best teammate. I want to be the best player that Coach wants to coach every day. Coach is happy about coaching him because he gives his all. I want to be that guy.

Like I said, I'm extremely blessed and grateful for everyone that has helped me to get to this point. I'm ready to get to work and ready to learn and ready to try to impact winning."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it just shows that we were the best program in college basketball and they still are right now. Coach Hurley is the best coach in college basketball, and he's producing players at a high level every single year. I'm not sure the exact number of draft picks he's had these past five years, but Coach Hurley has been the top of the top in college for a couple years now. I love that man to death."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,No. Just spend some time with some family. Soak everything in. Realize my life is going to change forever.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"They always told me that they were super high on me. But of course it's the NBA Draft, so you can't make any promises to anybody. I just can't wait to get out there and show my versatility, especially with the kind of talent that we already have on that team. It being the youngest team in the league right now, I feel like our future is pretty bright. I just can't wait to get out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"It's really hard to prepare for that moment. I mean, it's just a lot of emotions running through your head, especially when you hear your name being called. But on the basketball side of things, just always keep your head down, always working. Just staying humble and just having all that self-confidence in myself that everything is going to work out."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"I was just playing for the best coach in college basketball and now flipping to the NBA and going to play for a legendary coach like Coach Pop. It's a blessing. On the culture side of things, it's not really a big culture change from UConn to San Antonio. Just being out there in the pre-draft process, you can tell it's a hardworking program and super hard-nosed. I just can't wait to go out there and just show what I got."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Everything is just happening like really, really fast. Just being in the natty, soaking in that moment with my teammates, that's a super big accomplishment. And flip over to a couple months later and you another one of your teammates are top-10 picks. It really means the world to me and I wouldn't trade this for anything."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"I just talked to him on the phone not too long ago. We were just talking about coming down to San Antonio and just can't wait to get to work, and just excited for our future and excited for this upcoming season."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"It means a lot. Me and D.C. have been through so much together. I was friends with him before I got to UConn, before I committed to UConn. I've known him forever now. I mean, I know how much he's been through. For that to happen, it's such a great reflection on our program and just it's a reflection on all the hard work that we've put in. It's really a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Nah, he didn't tell me that as soon as I got drafted. That's probably a conversations we'll have a little later."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,It's all good.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,That's a castle for my last name. This is a castle.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,And that's my initials right on the bottom.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,The last thing I'll do in probably just celebrate with my family. I was born here in New York. So I have a lot of family here at the draft. Just doing whatever I can to show how much appreciation I have toward them for all their support right before I go out to San Antonio and start my next journey.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Well, I mean, what I picked for the draft, it wasn't intentional. But I guess it all really worked out. I guess I kind of manifested it to happen for me. But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"Oh, man, just want to thank God first, first and foremost, just for putting me in this position. I was ready to get ready to work. Coming in day one, do all the dirty work we need to do to win. I think I'm a winning player. I'm a win-now type of player, being one of the older guys in the draft. Just having that experience from college, and like I said, just doing all the dirty work, rebounding, diving on the floor for loose balls and just anything we need to do to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"I would love to play alongside Malik Monk, De'Aaron Fox, I think we have a great big in Sabonis, probably one of best passers in the NBA from a big standpoint. I'm just ready to be a two-way, versatile player. Get stops on one end, and I can also create some offense not only for myself but my teammates on the other end."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, I did work out for the Kings. Honestly, one of my better workouts, I believe. I think we had a very fantastic meeting with everybody who made the decision to draft me. Just very thankful for that. Me and Coach Brown talked, how we see myself fitting in on the team, and just coachplayer talk. I think I got a good feel for Coach and he got a good feel for me. Just ready to start in journey."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"It means everything. Just seeing his face whenever I got drafted, how happy he was, he didn't get a chance to get drafted. So just seeing his face and how excited he was for everything that we've been through, working out, countless hours throughout the night, morning. It's just a very special moment. Came up with handshake today and almost messed it up, but it's all right. We got it done."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, just me being confident, like I said, I know the type of player I am. I know what I bring to the court. I know I just wanted to give Kim the same promise he gave me when he first came to Providence, that he'll make me one of the better players in the conference. Just want to give him the same promise I got a seat for you at the green room table."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"Just a mature, win-now, do-it-all type of player. Like I said, rebounding, dive on the floor, take charges, anything that is needed to do to win. Just very excited to play with some great players, and hopefully we can win a championship."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"I'm feeling about as good as you think I'd be feeling. It's a special feeling to finally be here and have my name called, and especially being so close to home. You know, that means a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"It means a lot. Definitely because I would say when I was younger, I wasn't really like that in my area, and to now be sort of that guy that people want to see, especially being from the area and now back in the area. It means a lot to finally see all the stuff that I've done come to light."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,I haven't even touched my phone yet.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"Definitely. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he has texted me already."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"Probably say he'll be at the first game, and ""Don't suck."" Something he would probably say to me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"For sure, yeah, he ain't got no choice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"I would say the biggest adjustment would be how they game plan. It's real strategic for the league. I'm starting to see that working out for all these different teams. They have a real game plan and strategy going into every single game, and if you don't execute it, you can't play. I feel like that's something I'm going to have to get adjusted to."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,Feeling good. Super blessed. I'm ready to work. I'm going to give the Bulls organization everything I've got.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,"The program did an amazing job, even when they had the shutdown. Look at all the picks that they had. Everyone is good. All the coaches are amazing.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Dove for the ball. Lively landed on me. I knew right away. I've chipped it in the past, so it's not new. But, like, I mean, this tooth is loose. The other two teeth are wiggling. They were trying stuff in the locker room. I was like, I don't care. Just play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"This is unreal. I don't think it really has hit and settled in. This is a special group of guys, a special coaching staff that I'm just thankful to be a part of. Yeah, it's unreal. I'm just trying to enjoy the moment and not get too lit laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"At the moment I got traded, I was -- I wouldn't say disappointed. But you're in San Antonio. That's all I knew. Such a blessing to be a part of this roster. They just drive me in so many different ways, from top to bottom. I'm just so thankful and grateful for each and every one of them. They made me a better player and made me a better person. The city of Boston, everything, has just been amazing for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything. I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Man, I love Joe Mazzulla so much. Coming off the year I had, and he gets the job, and he's like, You know what? I'm going to start you. Which I wasn't expecting. He was like, I believe in you and I trust in you. This is going to give you the confidence. And from that moment on, I think it's changed my whole career. I'd do anything for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a great teammate, a great competitor. I was happy for him that he was able to go out there. The crowd cheering him on like that just got him going. He's still 7-4 and can do so many different things here. He's special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It's a surreal feeling. Still has not really kicked in yet. Just trying, I guess, to enjoy the moment. I kept saying, ""Wow."" These last seven years have been a roller coaster, up and down. I had to listen to all the s--- that people said about me, and tonight, it was worth it. Oh, my God."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, maybe getting drafted. That's something that you dream about. But this is at the top of the mountain. To be able to say we did it, that we came together and we won a championship. Banner No. 18 has been hanging over our head for so many years. To know that we're going to be engraved in history, and it still hasn't like registered. I'm just still trying to process it all. But we did it. We won a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"He told me that I was the best in the world. I said, ""You're damn right I am."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Say that again.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Please say that again laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That it was -- it was -- all the sacrifice was worth it. I'm so thankful to have been in the positions that I was growing up. Thankful for my mom. Thankful for my dad introducing me to basketball. My grandmother who helped raise me. All my friends and family that have supported me, every coach, every teammate that I've had. There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, this is going to be a night that I will remember for the rest of my life, from the game, the celebration, these moments. You know, over the last couple years, we had some tough losses at home in the playoffs. We've lost the NBA Championship at home in front of our fans. We had a chance to beat Miami in Game 6 a few years ago and lost that one. So to have a big win, the biggest win that you could have in front of your home crowd, I felt like that was really important to go out there and do everything in my power to make sure we won this game tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It took being relentless. It took being on the other side of this and losing in the Finals and being at literally the lowest point in a basketball career that you could be, to next year, to the following year, thinking that was going to be the time, and come up short again. So, I mean, people have said it before. But coming up short and having failures makes this moment that much better. Because you know what it feels like to lose. You know what it feels like to be on the other side of this and be in the locker room and hearing the other team celebrating, hearing them celebrate on your home floor. That was devastating. And now, to elevate yourself in a space that, you know, all your favorite players are in, everybody that they consider greats or legends have won a championship, and all of the guys I looked up to won a championship, multiple championships. So now I can, like, walk in those rooms and be a part of that. It's a hell of a feeling. This is more -- I dreamed about what it would be like, but this is 10 times better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"First of all, congrats to him. Well-deserved. Extremely happy for him. This is a hell of an accomplishment. The main goal for us was to win a championship. We weren't -- we didn't care who got Finals MVP. I know that I need him through this journey and he needs me. So, you know, it was great to see him have that moment and share that moment with him. I'm extremely happy for him. Well-deserved. That was big-time. He earned that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Man, from day one when I came in, my mindset was I'm going to give everything to this team and this city to try to win a championship here because I knew these guys have already been so close. Yeah, once I got hurt, it was a heartbreaking moment for me. I didn't want to accept the truth. It was like, no way it happened, right. But, yeah, tonight was the night. I was like, listen, I'm going to give it everything I have. And, yeah, I'm just super happy to be a part of this and give something to the team, and I'm super thankful for the support I've gotten from the fans. And tonight the arena was electric. It's been unbelievable playing in front of these fans."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know what, like since last game, I've been thinking about, like, how can I get my body ready for next game. Like, no matter how it is. And today I was like, I'm going to try everything possible to get out there. So from this morning, I was preparing myself that I will go out there. And, yeah, the medical staff was, like, unbelievable support for me and got me back out there somehow. And, man, I'm super thankful for them. And, yeah, I gave everything I could. I gave everything I could. And, man, it feels great to be a champion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, we have like a super-composed team. We don't have any like, loud, like, guys. Like, we're super confident but also, like, down-to-earth people in this organization and in this roster. Everybody had the mindset of, like, we are going to do whatever it takes, each of us individually, to get the job done. Like, we want to win a championship for this city. And everything, you know -- we did everything possible for that, and now we get the fruits from our labor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, finally, finally, man. It was a long road to get here, to be honest. To be the last team standing, it feels amazing. Like, all that work paid off. As I said, when I was still on stage and stuff, like it still felt surreal. Like, I couldn't -- and us as a team, I think we couldn't really, like, settle into that. But then once we got back to the locker room and started celebrating, I think that's when everybody realized we actually did it. We did it. And, yeah, Joe is an animal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I know, great question. Al is an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable person. Everybody loves him. He's a great leader. You know, knowing how he has been chasing this for so long in his career and finally get it done, and playing at a high, high level at his age, man, I don't even know, like, words I could use to describe him. You know, everybody loves him. And he gave everything to this team. He deserves it more than anybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No. Laughter. No, obviously, like, what was put out, it was the truth. It was, like, something torn. And then my tendon is just out of place. And it, like, pretty much hurts on every step. Like, I would take a walk in Dallas, and my leg would swell up. I was like, I don't know how I'm going to play, if I'm going to play. But my mindset was always, I'm going to try to find a way how I can manage this. And, yeah, somehow I got it going for this game. A lot of it was for sure like the adrenaline from just playing at the Garden and playing in front of our fans and having that opportunity to close it out. And, man, I got it going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Good question. I don't know how to answer it yet, to be honest. I think I'm going to need a little bit of time, and then I can kind of reflect. Because right now I'm just so in the moment and enjoying this. Man, this team, like, you know, it's just a special team and, like, everybody gave whatever they could for us to get here. And right now, we are just so in the moment. I think once I'm back home and settled, everything settles, I'll be able to compare better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's available. Expect to see him tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Have faith and execute what's necessary to win Game 5.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it wasn't necessarily Game 4. It was the time after Game 3 leading up to our time together yesterday. So, I think it's just kind of getting the general temperature of the team. Kind of figuring out where we're at. And, you know, regardless of where we are at, the series, you always have small resets like that throughout anything. So thought that was just kind of the temperature of our team and making sure we are in the proper space to be ready to execute."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It feels good. I think the most important thing, something that's really been going through my mind throughout this process, is you can't lose sight of the people that came before us. And I want to make sure every person that's worked for the Celtics, that's played for the Celtics that didn't win, knows that their work and what they have done has not gone unnoticed or it doesn't play a part in where we are at today. It can be so easy when you work for this organization and you don't win that the work that people put in just gets brushed over or gets ignored. And when I first got here, the staff, you know, Brad's coaching, the staff that they had, the foundation that they built with these guys when they were young, the foundation of what we have, is one of the reasons why we're here today. So I think that's one of the first things that came to mind, was just because we won this doesn't mean what the people have done before us isn't just as important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yes. Payton is one of the best competitors and one of my favorite people in the world. Just the way he competes, the professionalism and just for his ability to take pride in stuff like that. He's really grown as a player this year to becoming a well-rounded player on both ends of the floor, and he won us games. I think he won us moments. You know, as the playoffs go on, obviously some patterns change and things change, but those guys have to win moments of games for you, and Payton did that twice for us. That is just as important as any other plays that happened throughout the series and in the playoffs alone. You know, I've got a huge heart for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It really starts with them. You can't have a philosophy or a way of playing if you don't have a group of guys that are willing to buy into it and be disciplined. Quite honestly, this group of guys has been through so much in the league, they know what it takes. It's more about that. When you have a group of guys that have an understanding of what it takes, using the experiences that you've been through. And that, to me, is more than anything. It was a joy watching the guys just grow as a team throughout the year but also like really work at it. Like, there's a group of guys in the locker room that decided they wanted to win day one, and credit to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"That was awesome. It's a huge credit to him. Like I said, I know he's been in and out in the playoffs, but he's worked his ass off to try and get in and play as much as he could. It just says -- about the team, everyone is going to do whatever it takes to win. And even though he wasn't a hundred percent, he said he wanted to play, and he knew he could give us something. And I thought that the minutes he gave us were valuable. It speaks to who he is, and it speaks to the locker room."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, those were actual numbers. We live in an expected world. So we didn't pay much attention to the actual numbers. But to me it was just paying attention more to the process of what we were doing. And there were obviously some things that we had to improve upon from last year analytically to make up for some of the stuff that we lost. The guys bought into that. So to me, it was just more of the process of making sure that we are playing the right way, making sure, you know, we are attacking the game analytically in the right way, but also having the open-mindedness and discipline to do some of the other stuff. So I thought it was a good balance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like it's going to be like that for the rest of my career, as it should be. I think just having an understanding that praise and criticism are both just as dangerous. And if you don't handle them well, and I think we talked about that as a team this year, like winning is just as dangerous as losing if you don't handle it well. I think our guys handled winning the right way by, whether we won or lost, we just moved on to the next game. And it's Boston. Like, we wouldn't want it any other way. I think the ownership and the responsibility to give back to the franchise, give back to the city, that's just part of it. And so I think -- but you need it. Like, you need that. You need criticism. You need praise. You need expectations. All those things go into making who you are as a person, making who you are as people, as an organization. So just having an understanding that they are never going to go away. If someone tells you ""Good job,"" that's just as dangerous as someone telling you you suck. But you need both of them in order to get to where you want to get to, and there's no place else I'd rather be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,They shoot the ball a lot. I mean they are good. They are really good. That number is incredible when you think about it. But it works. And so we're going to need to add to that point total tonight if we want to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's a balance. You know, there's communication. There's always development with one's individual game. And so it's almost going to be a year since we had him in the draft. I think the draft is in nine or 10 days. And so to be able to see where he has improved, not just in his strength but also the other areas, and he can shoot. You know, he has the ability. He has a nice stroke out beyond the arc. And so in due time, he will be one that's going to probably shoot a lot of threes. But right now, his strength is offensive rebounding, the vertical game, and then defense, being able to guard the ball and then also protect the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, those have been games that we've looked at as games that can change a series. And so just understanding swing games, when you look at 3 and 5, are typically the swing games. So we really have had success in Game 5s, and hopefully that will continue tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we expected him back at some point, and he's available tonight. What does it change? Just, you know, his ability to score in Game 1 and 2, and we have to be better. We've got to make him put it on the floor where he just can't catch-and-shoot. Then defensively, we have to be aware of his shot blocking. And so we've got to account for him when we do drive it to the paint that he's one that can change or block shots, and we have to be better at that. In Game 1 and 2, we weren't very good. With him on the floor, we'll see how he moves, but I think that healthy or not healthy -- I mean, healthy, we are going to still check to see how he moves. So nothing changes there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we're going to fight. We put ourselves in a position in Game 4 to get a win to keep the series going, and now we're here in Boston. They have played extremely well at home. But we still feel that the pressure is on them to end the series. For us, it's to go out there and play. Hopefully we can copy some of the things we did in Game 4 to have success and hopefully can put ourselves in a position tonight to win. But, you know, as we've always said in this league, it's hard to close the door. Nothing's given. You've got to earn it. And so for tonight, we've got to find a way to keep this thing going and get it back to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"He's a superstar. He's one of the best players in the world. Most stars love that type of atmosphere, that type of setting. That's what makes them stars is they tend to bring their best game with their back against the wall. He's done it for the Mavs and for his national team, and so we expect nothing any less than that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I knew about the Red Sox and Yankees. You know, when you talk about being down 3-0, that's the truth and those are the facts. But there is another game to be played, and so if you can just stay in the present, that can help, you know, with what you're trying to achieve, and that's to keep the series going, and we did that in Game 4. Here on the road, we have to be in the present. We can't think about Game 6 or Game 4. We have to play Game 5. So we are excited about having this opportunity, and hopefully we can put our best foot forward to keep this thing going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their journey for seven years, there's been ups, there's been learning experiences for them with winning and losing, and so understanding for us, we've been together for five months, some of us, so this is a really positive journey that we've been on here, and we'll look at what we can do as we get to the Finals, just understanding we have to play our best basketball. Unfortunately, Boston was better than us in this series and they won the championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the first step is just to be in it. I think that's a big thing. A lot of us -- when I say a lot of us, excluding the people in the locker room, didn't have us here, and so to be able to start the playoffs in L.A., to start the playoffs in Oklahoma, to start the playoffs in Minnesota, to understand that that's not easy to do. I thought the group did a great job. Yes, we lost 4-1, but I thought the group fought against the Celtics and just, unfortunately, we just couldn't make shots when we had to, or we turned the ball over and they took full advantage of that. So there's a lot of positives in this run that we were on during the playoffs, but also, since March, we've been playing basketball at a high level. So when we go back to look at some of the stuff, what we can continue to build on and what we can get better at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a very good point. First year we lose to Golden State, who becomes the world champs, then we lose this year to the World Champs in the Boston Celtics. So, not a bad run in two out of three years. So, in between those two years, we get D-Live and we get trades that makes the team better, so a lot of positive things. We're a young team, and so this isn't a team when you look at, you know, do we have to replace some of the older players, it's -- you know, we have a core, a young core at that, and so this is an exciting time to be a Mavs fan and to also be a coach for the Mavs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, he's one of the best players in the world, and so I think the biggest thing for him is that we all would like to be healthy, but there's going to be bumps and bruises along the way. So, for him at the age of 25 to get to the Finals, to be playing his basketball at the level that he's playing is, now it's just being consistent, and I think we all would say he led the league in scoring. He also has won, so now it's just a matter of being consistent and, again, always being in the talk for MVP because when you have one of the best players in the world, you should be always fighting for a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's just time, being able to go through it, to get to know each other a little bit better on the court and off the court. So, I think the more time that these guys are around each other the better they're going to be next year. Again, five months without a training camp. This season started in Abu Dhabi and it's been going on for a long time. So for this group to spend time together, to fail, and to understand what it feels like to fail and also to see what failure is and then how do we get better and learn from that. I think I've got a great group of young men who will be hungry this summer and will come back ready to play at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it snowballed quickly. The turnovers led to easy baskets or wide-open threes. So they took advantage of that, and we couldn't keep scoring or keep pace with them. We got good looks that just didn't go down for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Very confident. I mean, that's a positive note that we can take from this series, just how far we made it and how proud I am of the guys. We answered a lot of questions this year on what we were capable of doing and now it's just about being consistent. I think probably in the last week, I said that I wanted to be remembered as one of the best teams of this era and our last few champions have been a new one each and every year. So, I see an opportunity for us to really build our future in a positive manner where this is almost like a regular thing for us, and we're competing for championships. You know, I think from a spiritual standpoint, I think I enjoyed this journey more than any other season, just because of the redemption arc and being able to learn as much as I did about myself and my teammates and the organization and the people that I'm around. It's a lot of good people here so it makes coming to work a lot of fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, it starts in the summertime, it starts early in preseason when you're developing your habits. I think we went 0-4 in preseason to start, which wasn't the best start. But we got off to a pretty decent start to the season and there was some injuries and some uncontrollable things that happened, but I think if you look at the overall big picture, Luka's right, and I've been saying it too, just failure, it can inspire you beyond measure. We started off as a fifth seed and started on the road in every series and we were able to accomplish this and we were able to grow as teammates and a brotherhood here, a sisterhood here, where we can really take that as a positive going into the summer. So, yeah, failing at this stage definitely sucks. It's a bitter feeling because you want to keep playing and you feel like your best game is coming up next and the shots that you shoot next game are coming up, and now we got to wait two and a half months, three and a half months so the new champion gets a chance. So, yeah, I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to grow with these guys in this locker room. Everybody across our organization, we've been able to celebrate our wins, but also learn how to celebrate our losses too and how to grow from that. So that's the difficult part of being human. When you really love something you really want to win and it doesn't happen, how do you respond from that. So I think that's where we are now, but I think I could tell you I'm pretty confident that we'll be back in the gym pretty soon and getting ready for next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it was emotional anyway. I mean, every series was emotional, just because I was just uncertain on how it was going to go and how we were going to respond to a little bit of adversity. We finally ran into a team where they beat us fair and square, and we weren't able to respond to a lot of their runs and we weren't able to execute at a high level. So when I was shaking everybody's hands, that was more of a sign of respect for their journey. They have been through an incredible five-year span of going to Game 7s or losing in the Finals, so they know what this bitter feeling feels like being up here answer answering questions about when this next year holds and I think they used everything as motivation. They were healthy, and they really kept their head down and weren't paying attention to any of the personal accolades or individual accolades. I think they just came together as a team and were okay with each person being great in their role and selflessly putting their best foot forward. So I think we learned more than anything from this series on what it takes to not only get back to this level, but win at this level, and the Celtics are the perfect example for us this season because of how much they have had to deal with in the past few years. So, it's admirable, you know, and to see -- did JB win Finals MVP? Yeah, that was big-time to see that trophy in his hands. I think him and JT should have split it, but those two guys in particular have, you know, almost been like students and as well now becoming teachers in their own right. So to see them accomplish -- see them accomplish that, I'm really proud and also extremely motivated to get back to this position in the next few years with my guys and be able to win this thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, basketball is a game of centimeters, man, sometimes inches, so when a ball is flying off your hands, sometimes it's going to feel good, sometimes it isn't. That's the maturity aspect. You got to move on to the next thing, and I've been talking about that. Whether I'm playing well specifically scoring-wise or I'm not, there is a team aspect here that we're becoming more gelled into or dialed into. I can score 25 points, but if I don't, we got to be able to pick each other up, and I think that's what we're learning about each other now, where they're going to be games where the shooting is not going to go well particularly for me or someone else on the team, and that's where we have to galvanize as a group and other players make plays and opportunities created for one another. I've been at the point of attack through most of my drives going against the Celtics one-on-one or coming off screens. So that's what the summer is for, is just continuing to work on those things that I saw this year, the physicality, being able to adjust to it and by next year be in a better position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would agree with that. Yeah, just time together means a lot, and failing together is not the ideal situation, but from a leadership standpoint, going through situations like that sometimes it will motivate you beyond things that you could imagine. When I was a little bit younger and I was injured in 2015 and we lost, it was a team loss. It wasn't just I was injured and we could have done this or that. So that went on my Finals record. I was 0-1. The next year we came back and won in a 3-1 comeback, and then the following year we lost against the Warriors and I haven't been back since. So, I look at it as, you know, an opportunity for us to observe what we did well this year as a group and how me and Luka can be better as the leaders of the team, one of -- a few of the leaders on the team, and really just enjoy the ups and downs of what's coming because now we know what to expect. So, this past year was a lot of newness. It was a lot of people being in new positions in terms of just the success. Success can be new for a lot of people too, but when you fail at the Finals, it's not something that you want to carry the disappointment forever or on to next season. We worked extremely hard to be one of the final two teams. We didn't achieve our goal, but we achieved most of our goal. So, this is just the last step that we have to get back to, and we know it's not going to be easy. We're going to be going against a lot of young teams that are emerging, but we're going to get better as well, and I think this experience will carry us forth in the following series that we play next year. God willing we make it back to the playoffs and get the chance to play our best basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it's easy to get to that point when you have no other choice but to look at your partner or your teammates and say that we're going to do this and we're going to accomplish it, no matter what anyone says. The hardest thing, I would say one of the most difficult things, not the hardest thing, but one of the most difficult things in this industry is, as I've been here for 12 years, is dealing with a lot of the relationship with, sort of say, social media or fans and media, and then us as players and wanting to achieve a golden legacy, so to say. Everybody looks at MJ as the prototypical guy, he was 6-0. Then you go down the list to Bill Russell and other great guys that have come through this league -- I could name a myriad of names, but for those guys in particular I think they have had the same trajectory or career path as some of the greatest to play the game, where they have lost early in their career and now they're at the top of the mountain because they earned their way there and they have been able to learn. So, again, I'm nothing short of proud of those guys, but I think this was a message to my teammates as well, that when we get this opportunity, God willing we get this opportunity again, we work hard, it's going to be more than just our talent that's going to get us over that edge. It's going to be more than just somebody scoring 30. It's going to take more than just scoring, it's going to take everything from you. That's what makes this thing beautiful too is, when you get to the top of that mountain, how do you stay motivated there. Now that they're there I think those are questions they're going to have to answer for themselves. But for us, we got to the top of the mountain and we failed, so now we have to start at the bottom, and that should be inspiring. So, grateful that I love what I do, grateful that I get to do it with people that love what they do too. So it will be a long summer, but looking forward to the start of next season now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm so grateful. I know I've said it before, but it's glory to the Lord for putting me in this position. It's been a lot of years. I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Wow. It was crazy because during free agency meetings in 2016, my agent and I, Jason Glushon, were both sitting in the meeting, and we just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wycs hand. And after the meeting we were like, Did you notice that? That's the attention. Man, I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, ""You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic."" And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want. The fact that it has come, it has happened, JT, JB, stepping up in a big way and leading us, it's special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, no question. You know, we all know Joe was thrown into the fire last year, and I felt like he did the best he could. But I just think this year, everything was different when we came in for workouts before training camp. He really, I felt like, put a sprint on everything how he wanted it to be and how he wanted us to work, how he wanted us to carry ourselves and how determined he wanted us to be. And it started from there. That energy that he had translated to the assistant coaches, to us, to the training staff, everybody, and we just kind of follow suit. I feel like this type of team is Joe Mazzulla ball. It's defending, being gritty on offense. It's being able to -- everybody be a threat on the court at the same time. And everything that he wanted to do, he was able to accomplish. He always knew when to push the buttons. He's hard. He can be a little whacky sometimes. But that's what we appreciate about him. He truly cares about us, and he cares about what it means to be a Celtic."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, the first thing you have to do when you come here is you have to embrace that pressure. And I was okay with being in that position. I was okay if we were getting criticized and we weren't getting it done because I understood what it means playing here. And to your point, finally overcoming that and winning and putting ourselves with the greats, this is special. Our group, we've had a lot of hardships the last few years. Last year, heartbreaker against Miami, Game 7. Year before, Golden State. It's been building up. But this team has been resilient, and we've continued to work. I'm so proud of Jaylen, and I'm so proud of Jayson. Those two guys continue to take steps forward. People all year criticizing them, all that expectation, all the pressure. They did it. And they've done it at a young age. They led our group. I'm just very proud of those guys and to put everything aside and focus on winning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Man, that was beautiful. That was beautiful. He did that, and you take a glance at the other team, and it's one of those that breaks your spirit, and then it just kind of fueled us. But Payton, man, that just sums it up. It was ups and downs for him, not knowing what to expect, when to play, when not to play. He's the kind of guy that he is a big-time player, and it's hard because we have a lot of guys. But man, him stepping up, cold, ready, not afraid of the moment, taking the shot and man, as soon as he shot it, like I don't know how you guys saw it, but I was like, man, he's about to knock it down. Like this is crazy. So, man, the fact that he knocked it down, like that was huge. That was special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I feel like it was impressive. I feel like what people expected us to do or doubted us to do, we did. So shout out to this team and this organization. We did it together, and that was the only way that we could do it was together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, that we did it together. I hope that when people watch us play, they see the joy that we play with, that we love playing together, and we got it done together. I feel like that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season. Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. It doesn't. Winning's always great. When you do it with people that you love to do it with, it feels great. When you see your teammates celebrating and jumping on each other and throwing champagne, there's nothing like it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's been a journey, you know. I think just being able to, I don't know, maybe reflect on it right now, it's crazy. It seemed like it was yesterday, sitting there with Wyc and him introducing me and just kind of handing me the jersey and everything. And then fast-forward to now, it's like insane. But I'm blessed to be here, and I'm so happy to be here and I'm so happy Brad gave me that call to come through, and JT texting me, hitting me up, talking about ""Come on, Champ."" It's been a hell of a journey."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I think I've spoken on this plenty of times, but they get scrutinized so much and they get so much pressure put on them for not winning or making it to the Eastern Conference Finals eight years in a row, or even making it to the Finals and not getting over that hump. But I feel like people finally see the relationship that they have. They see that from the beginning, they have always done it together. They have never compared against each other. They have always been joyful and happy for each other. So it's been great to experience on this side, and to be on this side and get this win, hopefully it's a burden off of their shoulders. But another burden is doing it again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"He's done a great job. He's definitely elevated my game. Had me look kind of outside of myself and bring something different, you know. On previous teams where maybe I had to score more or handle the ball more, here it was more about being available and knocking down corner threes and rebounding. Doing things that help this team because of the talent that we have. You know, he really opened my eyes to that and from the beginning really just made it known that whatever it takes, as long as it takes, we've got to get it done, and I'm not the only one on this team sacrificing. Everybody on this team sacrificed something."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they just -- they came out aggressive, man. They were good defensively. They're a great defensive team. Respect to them and respect to the coaches for their defensive scheme."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, it's been a hell of a year. I love these guys, man. Like, I mean, we put this team -- you know, with trades and everything was five months ago and to see the growth as a team, and it's different. You know, like -- I don't know. There's a lot of international guys and we don't always have family around and to be able to build a bond like this and to call the team family, it's awesome. To be able to do that in such a short amount of time is -- it's amazing. So obviously, we didn't get what we wanted, but I'm proud and everyone else is very proud of the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, it's fun when everything -- yeah. 1 through 15, man, like I couldn't -- like, best teammates. They're all great guys in all their individual ways. So, I mean, yeah, by far, man, it always makes your job a lot better when you have fun every day and to call those guys my teammates, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"We got here and I think everyone's hungry now. Obviously, we didn't get where we wanted to, but it's not the end of the world. We know that we need to regroup and be back here again next year. That's the goal every single year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, Kyrie does a great job and he's done a great job from the moment he's got here of being a leader and being someone for younger guys, but also for everyone on the team. So, I mean, obviously it is what it is. The crowds can chant whatever they want to chant. When we're away, they're obviously going to go against us. He does a great job of not letting it affect him and I think that goes back to his leadership on and off the court. So we have nothing but respect for Kyrie and we're not expecting the Celtics to be with us. We're opposing them. So whatever they say is whatever they say. But we all got his back, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Just maybe just physicality, coming out a little stronger or whatnot. But, I don't know, I really haven't thought about it too much. I don't know. My head's all over the place right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I don't know. I just wanted to leave it all on the floor tonight. I try to play every game like it's my last. But, I mean, individual, like it doesn't really matter at this stage. I really just want to win. Yeah, I don't know. We just didn't win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Nothing. Sad we lost. No specific.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"It doesn't matter if I was hurt, how much was I hurt. I was out there. I tried to play, but I didn't do enough."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I feel great. We did some great moves. I would say we've been together for five months. I'm proud of every guy that stepped on the floor, all the coaches, all the people behind. Obviously, we didn't win Finals, but we did have a hell of a season and I'm proud of every one of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,They were physical a lot. They have great defenders.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Just everything. They're a great team. That's what they do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't want to talk about what's next, man. I have some decisions to make. I'm just trying to get a little bit healthier. We'll talk -- we have interviews in two days, right? So I'll give you an answer then."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Right now, I don't really know. That's not what I'm thinking. But they're a great team. They have been together for a long time, and they had to go through everything, so we just got to look at them, see how they play, maturity, and they have some great players. We can learn from that. We got to fight next season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just stay together, man. I think just having Ky on my team -- I mean, on our team, he's unbelievable. Just help him. We said, We'll fight together next season, and we just going to believe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"To be honest, I can't even put it into words. Just Bill Russell and what he's meant for me through my Boston journey, and his spirit. You know, everything that he stood for, just for this to be the Bill Russell MVP Award, it just -- I've got nothing, man. I don't even know what to say. It's unreal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we learned. I think we learned from all of our mistakes. All of our adversity has made us stronger, made us tougher. All season you could see it. We started from the jump. We made all the sacrifices. We played both ends of the ball at a high level. We didn't skip any steps. And this was the result. But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment. And it makes it feel even that much better that we had to go through all the journey, the heartbreak, the embarrassment, the loss, to get to the mountaintop. It's great. And shout out to all the supporters and the city of Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't even put into words the emotions. It's just I'm blessed and I'm grateful. This was a full team effort. We had a great team. My teammates were great. They allowed me to lead us on both ends of ball, and we just came out and performed on our home floor. It's just amazing. You know, it could have gone to anybody. It could have gone to Jayson. Jayson, like I can't talk enough about his selflessness. You know, I can't talk enough about his attitude. It's just how he approached not just this series or the Finals but just the playoffs in general. And we did it together as a team, and that was the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just our growth together. We've been through a lot. We've been playing together for seven years now. We've been through a lot, the losses, the expectations. The media have said all different types of things We can't play together, we are never going to win. We heard it all. But we just blocked it out, and we just kept going. I trusted him. He trusted me. And we did it together. To get to this point and share that experience with JT is just awesome, you know what I mean? It's amazing, and it feels great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"If you would have asked me that maybe a year ago, I would probably say yeah. But just at the point I got to right now, it feels great. But any of the personal awards, it is what it is. Yeah, the doubters, they may be quiet now, but they will be back. They will be back next year with something to say. I'll embrace that moment the same and get after it yet again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,Golden Bears.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't. I can't. I absolutely can't, man. Just the story and the journey is awesome. You know, just being drafted here in Boston, like a lot of the people probably didn't watch me play in the Pac-12 at Cal. You know, it led to a lot of people feeling a way about that. And, you know, I just came in and kept my head down and told myself, I'm going to just keep working. And, you know, to be here in this moment now, through all the years, through all the doubt, through all of the ups and downs, through all of the verdicts, through all of the everything, it just makes the story that much sweeter. But I can't even put it into words. Like, it just feels great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, nobody deserved it more than Al. He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us. Like just his performance all season long, like Al is 37, 38 years old, and we leaned on him so much. Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains, you know what I mean. The only thing he does is add to winning. For him, great teammate. It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we have an opportunity. I think we definitely have a window. We take it one day at a time. We definitely have to make sure we stay healthy. But, you know, we'll enjoy the summer, enjoy the moment, and then we get right back to it next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, it still kind of feels unreal. It feels like there's another game or something tomorrow. But, you know, I can't tell you enough about our group and our coaching staff. They were great all season long. They prepared us for these moments. We had an excellent game plan in the Finals, and then all of the guys contributed. Like, for example, like Payton Pritchard, like unreal, right. Unreal. Like just comes in the game and drains one from halfcourt. That dude, he's a f---ing legend, man. Shout out to Payton Pritchard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It means a lot. I wish my grandmother was here with me to see this moment. But I woke up from my pregame nap, and I had a dream, and my grandma was in the dream, and she gave me a hug this afternoon. I just knew everything was going to be all right. But I wish she could be here. But she was so important and pivotal in my life. And it's just awesome. I know she would be proud of me. Grandma, I know she was watching, and I love you so much."

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I don't know about celebrate, but it's been a nice, relaxing day. Spent some time with the kids. My dad is in town and spent time with him. Just try and enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Try to move on. I mean, that's what the playoffs is all about, win or loss, you've got to move on from it. You've got to learn from it. You understand that you've got to play better than obviously Game 4. Every game gets more difficult, so we just have to be locked into our game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We've been lucky enough to have a lot of the past champions here, and just seeing their presence. I just think that when it gets tough, and obviously it's going to get tough. We've just got to stick together. We've got to believe in one another, and we've been doing that all year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"For us? I would say we're a confident group. I just think you've got to stick together. There's going to be ups, and there's going to be downs. And, I mean, if someone is struggling or whatever, you have to pick them up, and that's the type of team we have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Obviously you just look at the rebounding numbers, that tells you a lot about what happened in that game. Just get back to five guys crashing the paint and just trying to get every rebound."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't look at it as pressure. I do notice, especially this time of the season, playoff time and obviously being in the Finals for the second time. When you drive around and go to the gas station, or I wanted to go get some ice cream yesterday, it's Celtics gear everywhere and everybody is super excited about this team and what we have accomplished and what we have the chance to accomplish. You really just feel the love and support from everybody in the city of Boston, and how bad they want us to win, how much they have been cheering for us. So I don't look at it as pressure. Just unconditional support, and that we have an amazing fan base here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It did take some time. For one, normally, when you're a top five draft pick, you go to a lottery team that is rebuilding. I was in a unique situation from the rest of the guys in my draft class in that the Celtics were the No. 1 seed in the East before. We were competing for a championship ever since I've gotten here. It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I would say just throughout that season. I had no idea who Cedric Maxwell was. I thought he was just like a radio guy laughter. I didn't know that he played on the team, and he won Finals MVP. So there were just different instances throughout the season in my rookie year where I would learn about different people that played an intricate part in this organization -- the history throughout the Celtics and what the Celtics mean to the game of basketball. You just grow a level of appreciation through your time here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. When I found out that I was going to be a dad, I was still in college. I had like a week or two left. I wasn't ecstatic. I was a little selfish at that point because I knew that I was about to go chase my dream and be in the NBA. I felt like that was going to affect what people thought of me, affect where I went in the draft. So I'd be the first to say I wasn't like super thrilled to find out I was going to be a dad, and quickly realized that it was like the best thing that ever could have happened to me. There's nothing better than being a dad. I think, especially for me and my first year in the NBA at 19, it taught me a sense of responsibility. Because it's tough, being 19 years old and coming into fame and this newfound fortune. Nobody can, I guess, help you or prepare you for what it's like to be 19 and have millions of dollars. And I think -- not that I think. I know that having Deuce at that age grounded me. Because whatever decision I wanted to make, I had to make sure that he was taken care of. I couldn't just up and go or do everything that some of my peers were doing because I had to go home and put him to bed. Or for Father's Day weekend I was going out of town or -- I had to skip out on this trip with my friends because it was my weekend with him. Not that it's a sacrifice. I willingly would choose those things. But it has taught me a sense of responsibility, as well as just making the right decisions. Knowing that there's a six-year-old mini me essentially watching everything that I do and knowing that I have to be the best version of myself. I have to make the right decisions because he's always watching."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think after Game 4, he just reminded us to have fun. We wanted to go for the kill, essentially, and we wanted to win so bad that maybe we got away from what makes us special and what makes us the Boston Celtics. Today, just reminded each guy why he's important to this team and why we all need each other and what a person brings to the table. I think that was really important for us to go over today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't think we came out and expected that we were going to come out and roll over on it and win. I firmly believe we had the right intentions. We wanted to win. We wanted to play the right way. That moment -- we wanted that moment. But I think we maybe put too much pressure on ourselves at that moment to be perfect or think it was going to go how we wanted it to go. Joe did a great job today of reminding us that it's okay to smile during wars. It's okay to have fun during high-pressure moments. That's what makes our team unique and special. We would love to win tomorrow, more than anything. But if it doesn't happen, it's not the end of the world. We have more opportunities. So just setting that table of don't surrender to that idea that we have to win tomorrow. We would love to, absolutely. But Game 5 is the biggest game of the season because it's the next game on the schedule. So going with that mindset, and just have fun. That's really what we talked about today. Get back to having fun and being a team and how special we are and the team that got us here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Very excited. We're excited to come out here and compete and try to get this W.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"We came back Saturday morning. It was a nice flight. We already moved on from it. There's no reason to dwell on it. Get ready for Game 5 and try to get the W. The flight was good. We got together as a team, enjoyed it and get ready."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It would be huge to win this next game. We really want to win the next game. But if we don't, it's not the end of the world. We have three more rounds to go, at most. But the most important game is the next one, and to do it in front of the home crowd would be special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I'm expecting it to be rowdy. Definitely a crazy, crazy atmosphere. Looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just shows that teams are capable of coming back from that. If you get hot, you can win four games in a row. So understanding that, and knowing that every game we've got to bring everything we've got. It's going to take 48 minutes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player. He's somebody we care for deeply and gives us a great boost. Him as a person, just being there is huge for us. We are lucky to have him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He definitely wants to play. He's a really big competitor, and I know he's going to do everything in his power to get out there and put on that uniform with his teammates."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They just beat us in every category possible 5050 balls, rebounding, shooting, defensively. It's like one of those games, you just scrap and look forward to the next one because they beat us fair and square."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"That will never happen if you don't run back on defense, rebound, execute and get to your spacing. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I haven't talked to him yet. Going to talk about that before we start at 200. So I'm not sure kind of where he's at. But he's trying and doing everything he can to try to put himself in position to be out there. I know that for sure.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"You're just made by all the experiences and things that you have. Regardless of what I am, what I'm made from, first and foremost, my identity, Christ is the most important thing before all that. And after that, it's about winning for the Boston Celtics and the process of winning -- getting back on defense, playing hard, transition, rebounding, spacing, execution. Those things are the most important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It's a good question. Multiple layers to that. Obviously it's game plan, execution, and that can change once the game begins. One side of the ball is heavily dictated by the other. I think one of the things that we've freed our minds to this year is just making reads and having an understanding, having a spatial awareness about who is where, what's the spacing, what's the attack and just being able to make plays on both ends of the floor there. So there's definitely obviously a game plan component. You have to have a plan going into it. But at the end of the day, it's the individual pride, and then it's the instincts from the guy when they are out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, every game, regardless of how it goes, there's always stuff that you can learn from and there's always stuff that you don't learn from. Regardless, I think the most important thing is our process toward getting better has been the same whether we have won or lost, whether we have won big or lost big. We have always tried to find the 10 or 12 possessions we can get better at and find the things we did pretty well and how can we do those more. I just kept a consistent process toward our postgame retrieval, and then how we grow with that heading into the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"When they are at their best, the team that dictates the pace dictates kind of the momentum and the opportunities. So yeah, I think that's definitely part of it, is how can we dictate the pace of the game and how can we dictate the momentum of the game. You can do that in different ways. Transition is obviously one of those, but there's other ways you can do that as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that. Just have to be open-minded. Every game takes on a life of its own. We have the things that we can control and then we have the things that we have to be ready to adjust to kind of depending upon how the game goes over the course of time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just a guy defined by the ability to make plays on both ends. Like you said, mistakes don't weigh him down. Doesn't matter if he misses a shot or makes a mistake on the defensive end. Just has the ability to make plays and he can do them on both ends of the floor. That balance of impacting the game in different ways is crucial for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Thank you.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, definitely. I think some of our defensive struggles came from our offensive struggles, no question, and vice versa. There's definitely some things we need to do better on the offensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We just take it as -- being together, in film and just understanding the flow of the game. But even before the game, Coach Kidd said, I hope you packed your bags because we are going to Boston. Just having that mentality of doing whatever it takes. We've definitely been changing our ID from playing free to playing desperate. Doing whatever we can to get a bucket or get a stop. That energy, that focus is going to propel us into transition buckets, transition steals and trying to get into the game that we play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We definitely need to help them. They have a lot of weight on their shoulders. They're controlling the ball the majority of the time. They have the majority of the points. No matter if it's the offensive or defense side, we're backing them up. They can have their foot on the gas as much as possible knowing that if they have to take their foot off the gas a little bit, we're going to pick it back up. There are going to be times when they get tired or they're not going to bring the ball up the floor. That's where we are their backup as role players, as people on the bench doing what we need to do to take a little weight off their back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We were playing like how we play. We were running and talking and playing free. We were just trusting one another. We were getting back into the mentality of trusting the pass, trusting the next pass and, on the defensive side, just trusting the person behind you, trusting the person who is talking."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Definitely can. We're not going to say that Game 4 was our best game. Game 4 was a good game, but we're not hanging our hats on it. We adjusted, and now it's just taking what we did in Game 4 and adding a little bit more aggression into Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,I wouldn't say it's a new series. Everyone just counted us out after the first three. We are not going to count ourselves out. We are going to double down and put ten toes down and make sure that we are giving it our all on the court. Put our heart and soul on the floor and do whatever it takes to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's going to be loud and nasty. You do your best not to focus on the crowd. There's going to be a lot of people talking to you. Social media, walking down the street, you're in the hotel room, you're in the hotel, you're going to hear people talking to you, you're going to hear people talking to you coming to the arena. It's part of the game. Part of the job. You have to deal with adversity and people always telling you you can't, and you've got to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"That specifically wasn't the conversations, but the vibe was always good because we won, right. I think we also showed that that's how we've got to play and how we should play the game. That was more so the reason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"As a team, when you play professional sports, you never quit. You always fight. You always play. You always compete, and I think we showed that the last game. We had that energy, like a little bit desperation. We have to treat every game like that. There's no relaxing. We've got to play our best because obviously we're playing against the best. But we are going to stay together and compete until the last game. So that has to be the mindset no matter what. There's always been history in sports, in different sports. So I think as an athlete, you should always believe and always keep fighting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Well, we have our schemes and we have a certain way that we play. I think it's more so understanding what we want to be and how we want to create certain mismatches and certain drive-and-shot opportunities. It's not so much changing our playing style right now. We've got to keep playing the basketball that we played all season long that got us here. We've just got to make sure that we create the spot and the spacing for Kyrie and Luka. The first three games, we didn't do it as much. So they had to take all the shots and they had to settle for different shots. Game 4, we played with a different pace. We got it up quick. That creates mismatches and better opportunities for us, and also creates an open floor, for example, and Derrick Jones, attacking and stuff like that. It's more about finding the right spacing, but there's no time to change our style right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Whatever it takes. That's the mindset, it's not going to be perfect, especially against a team like that. There had to be adjustments obviously because they play different than other teams. But I think we have great guys, smart guys, high-IQ guys that can adapt to changes, that's what we showed. Last game, overall, still the energy was the key factor. And one of the guys who got us going early, for example, Dereck Lively, just like having that energy and alertness helps us to be on the same page, communicate better and have the right rotations down. And that's what we've got to keep doing. Challenge every shot, they are a great shooting team, so you can't have moments where you mess up multiple offensive or defensive plays because they are just going to go on a run. For us, the energy kept us being alert and helped us adjust to the defensive rotations, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought they were really good in Game 4. That helped us get to Game 5. But just understand, we can't have three on the ball. They are too good at being able to make that pass. They are the best team at shooting the three. There are some things that we can clean up, and we're going to have to be better here in Game 5 if we want to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think what helps is we were in that situation last game. So not to change or deviate from what we talked about in Game 4. It's just take each possession one possession at a time, and hopefully we can put ourselves up winning each quarter. We ended up doing that. Same thing that we are talking about today and tomorrow is we can only focus on Game 5, and trying to find a way to win here in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, one, it's hard to win in the Finals. And so I think, as you brought up, each game, we have gotten better on both ends, offensively and defensively. So the trend is to continue to get better. Hopefully we can do that in Game 5, where we can get better defensively and offensively. We started to knock down shots here in Game 4, and hopefully we can get those same shots in Game 5 and have the opportunity to knock them down. But looking at Luka and Ky, those two have to set the tone for us and everybody else will follow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think, and I'm not speaking for him, but just from experience, just as an athlete, you want to get another opportunity, and he has that opportunity here tomorrow night. Hopefully he can take full advantage of that. Make some adjustments and look back at Game 1 and 2 and see what they were doing to him defensively and hopefully take advantage in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Our defense didn't really change. I think just the effort. I think Luka participated at a high level, and he was really good on the ball. He came up with some deflections and steals. We believe that he is going to be involved in the pick-and-roll tomorrow. We're going to need that same effort from him, but also for the guys that are there to help protect him, they will be ready to protect him. But he's got to participate at a high level, and we believe he will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he looked like he joined a special company. He looked like Ray and Steph. So we're going to need that here in Game 5. If it's a close game, hopefully he is able to knock down those same shots, get those same shots. But it was great to see Timmy knock down those shots. Hopefully he can build on that, and as a team we can build on that. We are going to need that here in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"They are not a team that changes. They are a team that makes you change. So they are going to probably look to see that they had some good looks from three that didn't go down, and also being able to probably get Tatum and Brown going early. Having those two attack our defense early is probably something that could be an adjustment. But for them, it's shooting the three, creating in the three and then capitalizing on your mistakes. Hopefully for us, our mistakes were low in Game 4, and hopefully they are low in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's probably something to that. If we look at the analytics of our group, they are young, and as the series goes on, they get better. Hopefully that's true tomorrow night. Sometimes when you do play an opponent over and over, you get used to the tendencies and you start to capitalize on that on both ends, defensively and offensively. Hopefully our group has seen enough of Boston to understand what they are good at, and hopefully we can take that away tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I don't want you to mistake us smiling and joking around with each other and being in practice, you know, for a weakness or that we are not taking this any more serious than we were in Game 4. I just think we are here in Boston and just trying to settle ourselves. We had a meeting, just as a squad, at the hotel, where we went over film. So we were pretty locked in from there, and there was carryover into our early minutes in practice. And then when you guys come in, pretty much having fun. It's been this way since we were kids. We want to make sure we relish in this moment, don't take it for granted and just ground ourselves here, too. I think the last two games, we were even more intense when we were here in Boston. Don't think we got as settled as we would have liked. So we just wanted to try some things a little different, a little bit more smiling. And then 24 hours from now, getting ready for all-out battle against this great Celtics team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Well, to answer your first part of your question, I would be being dishonest if I just took the time to say thank you for putting those words together in terms of my interactions with people being majority of the time positive. I'll be honest with you, it's not always positive all the time. I'm human. Sometimes there's some misunderstanding or miscommunications and it takes a little bit of a longer, thorough conversations just to get on the same page. I think I've just figured out in my life, a lot of people just want the time and space to be heard. They want to be listened to. And then if they respect you and you respect them, then they'll listen to you and give you the space to say how you feel as well. I've talked about it over the past few months, just where I was in 2017 or '18, when I first got traded here to Boston. I wasn't in the place to be able to vocalize my feelings or know how to do that. I was learning how to be a man. Learning how to be a father. So part of that evolution came from that, taking the time to go inside and figure out who I wanted to become. But also, I had to accept some of the things, some of the choices I had done in my life. When you look at yourself in the mirror, sometimes you don't like what you see, and that could lead to some depression or lead to some anxiety or lead to other mental health issues. That's a big thing that I think our generation is spearheading, where I hope that the older generation can take a lesson out of our book, that this isn't just some spiritual '70s type of mantras we are trying to put out here. We actually believe in what we talk about in terms of meditation and having the ability to slow your life down and making sure that you keep your priorities straight. Because the world is not going to care about how you feel mentally all the time or whether or not you are healthy when you are at home or taking care of yourself. So you have to figure out that space for yourself and figure out the village and the tribe that you want to have around you that supports those goals that you have personally. I don't want to get too preachy, preachy. I could speak for hours. But, yeah, that's been the growth since 2017. Even before then. Just learning how to be a person in this world, making an impact in a positive way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"When I look back, getting traded here, it wasn't one of my options. It wasn't like No. 1 on my list. So when the trade opportunity got approached to me, instead of going back and appreciating the Celtics' history, I just came in with an open mind and just kind of like, all right, I'm just going to go with the flow into this. But I think that was the wrong approach. Just being young. Now being older with hindsight looking back, I definitely would have taken time to know the people in the community and talked to some of the champions that have come before me and actually extend myself to them instead of the other way around, expecting them to be there giving me advice. Because they have been through this. They have championship pedigree here. They have shown it for years. They are one of the most winningest franchises in all of sports. So you have to show your respect here. I think that's what I struggled with initially, was figuring out how I'm going to be a great player here while winning championships and also leading a team and selflessly joining the Celtics' organization or the cult that they have here. That's what they expect you to do as a player. They expect you to seamlessly buy into the Celtics' pride, buy into everything Celtics. And if you don't, then you'll be outed. I'm one of the people that's on the outs laughing. I'm perfectly fine with that, you know what I mean. I did it to myself. They don't welcome me with a warm embrace, even though I know a lot of people in the organization and I'm friends still with some of them. But, yeah, doing it to myself. And that's what I was talking about in terms of accepting the choices. But looking back, I would have shown my respect and have more of a council around me from some of the Boston Celtics that came before me to explain what the pressure is like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"You just expect to have a magnifying glass on you everywhere you go. I don't think Boston appreciates being kind of second class to New York in terms of the media capital of the world, but this is the media capital of the world as well. There's a lot of history here off the court. The community has integrated into the Celtics' team. That's probably the best way I could say it. The community is what makes the Celtics great here, the Boston pandemonium. That's what makes this space so loud and so special, and they take pride in it. If any player is coming here, getting drafted here, thinking about coming here for free agency, getting traded here, I just think do your homework and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. That's something I could offer."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"He was just playing with a liberation within his game and came out knocking shots. That's what we need from him, is just to stay confident, stay fluid. He's been going a great job with the young guys on the bench as well, keeping them engaged. I think that's the next part of his evolution, including all of ours, is just continue to be a better teammate, regardless if you're shooting the ball or not. I think that helps reward you when you're doing those things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, we just have to wait and see tomorrow, man. You know, change a few things up. Be prepared for what I'm getting myself into. My teammates, most importantly, and not making this about me or getting into the energy with anyone else other than my teammates. That's about it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, let's just call it what it is. When the fans are cheering, ""Kyrie sucks,"" they feel like they have a psychological edge, and that's fair. Of course, if I'm not making shots or turning the ball over, that makes it even more of a pressing issue that they can stay on me for. I think in order to silence even the self-doubt, let alone the crowd doubt, but the self-doubt when you make or miss shots, that's just as important as making sure I'm leading the team the right way and being human through this experience, too, and telling them how I feel. I've had a few teammates be in this building with me for wins and losses, so I know what it feels like for both. I try to pay attention to the positive things that got us wins here earlier in my career, but also thinking about things that I can learn from in performances that I've had here where I didn't play up to par. It's just being honest about it and just breathing through the experience and having fun with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, by just thinking about the goal that we have in front of us as best we can, and try not to get tired of everyone talking about the history that has not been made. I've said it over the past 48 hours, just putting our best foot forward and just simplifying. It's basketball. Win, lose or draw, or win or lose, that's all that can happen. Just want to be as prepared as we can for whatever the environment is going to be like in terms of what's expected from you. But what I'm sharing with my teammates now is just enjoy the moment. We got a chance to accomplish one of our goals, which is to make it back to Boston. We have another goal in front of us, and that's to make it back to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"No, I left home pretty early. My kids, they made the trip to Dallas. They were still sleeping when I left. So I think they felt the trip and everything. When I get home today, I'll get to spend time with them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we acknowledge that they got the best of us. Just trying to quickly shift our focus to this opportunity that we have here, Game 5 here at home. Yeah, we're looking for a good practice today, a good session to get back on track for tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It's going to be special. It's going to be special tomorrow. It's going to be electric. The fans, they've wanted to be a part of an opportunity and game of this magnitude with a chance that we have in front of us. So I know it's going to be electric here from before the game. I've been in these types of games, like where they are big games like that. The fans here, they are all into it. So I don't expect anything less."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"People are going to use different things, and whatever you need to do, that's what will happen. For us, it's understanding the opportunity we have in front of us and making sure to take advantage of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. I think we understand that they are a desperate team and they are playing probably a little freer. We know what that mindset is like. For us, it's really controlling what we can control and making sure that we are solid in the things that we need to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think they were just a tougher team. I think they locked into tendencies and played defense as a team and played very well.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think deep down, however long it takes, whatever it takes. No matter where it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nobody likes to get beat like that at any point in anybody's career in the season. But in the Finals, it also doesn't feel good. So really just want to get back out there and play again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I was actually the first one up today, which is weird. I'm usually sleeping in. But it was cool just to have the kids. Got breakfast and really just enjoyed seeing them. I mean, being lovey and playing around. It's been a great morning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know, a little bit of both. I think that they adjusted and they played very, very hard and very desperate. We have to do the same thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Working on Father's Day kind of sucks. You would think as fathers, we would get the whole day off. But I guess you guys want to talk to us. Father's Day is cool. I think this is maybe the second time that I've been in this type of situation, either on my birthday or Father's Day, where I'm still working. I'm not too mad at it, but I would like the day off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's huge. Made it all the way back to Game 7. Knowing that feeling and remembering that feeling and using that feeling to boost our play and intensity is something that I obviously rely on them for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. Again, I think a loss is a loss. It doesn't matter how it was lost or by how many points. I'm a competitor and I think we're competitors, and we want to win every game. You just have to take it on the chin, just like we did, and come back and try to prepare for Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"We are excited to get back on the court and put our best foot forward in Game 5. After a loss like that, you always feel like there's extra motivation to get back on the court and get going again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"We haven't watched anything yet, but I'm sure we'll watch a little bit, at least, see what went wrong, what we can learn from it and how we can get better from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I wouldn't say it changes from win to loss. It's pretty similar every game, to be honest with you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I would say it's similar. I mean, you're never perfect in a win or a loss, so I feel like there's always room to grow and improve. And I think he does a good job of that, just keeping us grounded, even after we were on a 10-game winning streak before this in the playoffs, which is pretty rare. But also highlighting that that that's a pretty successful accomplishment, but coming off a loss like that, theres a lot to learn."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I think Jayson said it the other night. We expect it to be as loud as it has been all season, and we are excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"You crave that as an athlete, as a player. You dream of it, and, you know, to be a part of it is pretty special as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"You know, it's a weird balance almost. It's hard to, like, take moral victories from that, but also in the same breath, you know, it's nice to see some go through on the offensive end and things like that. But it's kind of a weird, fine line of pulling some good things from it but also understanding that we lost by 40."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"To be honest, like some of my best games I've had as a player are my worst-shooting performances in pregame shooting and shootaround, but some of my worst nights have been where I've felt really good in warmups. I feel like there's no correlation, to be honest with you. It's just the rhythm of the game and feel for the game when you're out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I put Luka up for sure. Luka, Patrick Beverley. I dont know. The third one is up for debate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"My G.O.A.T. is Kobe Bryant. Growing up, that's the reason I play basketball. Thats the person I pretended to be like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think it's definitely a bit of a challenge when you get to be where you feel like you do have spare time, and it's finding out the best ways to be able to use that spare time. For me, I enjoy being around my family and playing video games. I love FIFA. So that's usually what I do in my spare time. I love coffee. So I tend to really just do that type of thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Just drink a lot of water, man. That's my advice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think it's a little bit of everything. I think it's do-or-die, and I think we know that we weren't playing to the level that we should be playing. So I think whenever we play games like that, it's enjoyable. I think we need to continue to ride that momentum and make the adjustments from the game that we won and be ready to go for tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just piggybacking off what we did in Game 4, trying to take it to the next step, taking it one game at a time. Having a lot of patience and staying motivated, staying encouraged. It's a long series. We can make it a long series if we do the right things. We have a small margin of error, and we are going to make sure that that margin stays small."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was a lot of fun being around the home crowd, had a lot of energy in the arena and just doing the things that just kind of like made the game fun. You know, you put a lot of love into the game, you get a lot of love back. Trying to stay consistent in those areas, what we succeeded in, how we were there for each other and how we picked each other up and staying positive. That game, we were playing desperate. We didnt want to go home. Just give us some type of life, and that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just brought me back to life in all honesty. I felt like I had a terrible start and I didn't really get to a point of playing until like the third because of the simple fact of the mistakes that I made out on the floor, which obviously, like at the end of the day, I'm never going to complain whenever they make that change, which is taking me often floor when I'm not out there being at my best. Scored a couple of baskets down the stretch, got the blocks, gave us a lot of energy at the time because I felt like I was actually doing something to impact and help the team win. It was a breath of fresh air, I would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Last game, I felt like we got a lot more comfortable, wasn't worried about the mistakes or anything like that. Maybe I was worried about mine at the beginning but just throughout the game, just seeing how guys were playing and just the energy and the effort that was given out there on the floor it, would have been a big slap to the face to those guys if I would have never came out and did the same thing. Like I said, we got comfortable for sure just playing and having fun with the game, doing the right things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, you know, I don't think he really said anything to the refs as much the last game. Just shows that he's taking that step in the right direction. We have to be able to do the same thing. When it comes to the path to success, there's a lot of failure in that. You have to use those failures as a lesson to really just go down that path and keep going and just find some type of way to be better than the last."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not lately. I would say living in the past when it comes to something like that, I feel that would pull me further away from the game where I am at right now. I dont really worry about how my journey started off, I care about how I finish my journey."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,Obviously we are going to be upbeat. We're focused throughout practice on what we have to do. It's just about being relaxed and making sure we're ready once the game comes.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"We know it's going to be loud and it's going to be an atmosphere the fans want to see them win, but it's our job to stop that as much as possible. We know it's going to be loud and rowdy. We just need to make sure that we stick to our game plan and stick together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think that's the thing is making sure I stay ready and then when I come in, doing what I can, and that's bringing pace, trying to relieve as much as possible for Luka and Ky when Im out there bringing up the ball. But letting the game come to me as well. I think that's the most important thing. Not trying to go out there and score 50 points or whatever. It's just about playing in the game plan and attacking where I can attack."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I do think so. I think it showed a lot about us. But I think the key for us is going to be do that when it gets hard and when it gets tough. We've seen where they hit a couple threes or coming out of a timeout, they will hit two or three threes, and it's just about how do we react to that and get back to our game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's been a lot of reflecting on that. Even just looking at this year and playing in the NBA Finals and going to an Olympic Games, the two biggest stages in the world. So I think I'm forever grateful. It's easy to take it for granted, but I've been through injuries and not being able to play and missed out on events. I'm just making sure I do everything, and grateful that I'm on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Hopefully. Obviously he had a great career. And if I can do something like that, it would be amazing. But it's going to start here, and hopefully we can get this next win and keep building with that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, that's the only way we can look at it. If we lose, we're going home. So we need to make sure that we win every quarter, every possession. I think that's kind of the mindset is make every possession important, and then if we do that, we can win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think it shows a lot of character with us with being able to fight. You know, we could have been on vacation now, but I think it shows how we want it as a team, and we are ready to fight for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I would say Real Madrid is in a league of their own. They are at the top of the Euro. But obviously Boston has been -- I think Boston, Lakers, they are obviously the two major NBA teams in the league and they have been since day one. So it's obviously a little bit of comparison."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's obviously different because it's the Finals. Every team plays the whole season to be here. We are the one to be here in Boston, obviously. So it's a little bit different. But you've got to play basketball. You've got to give everything you have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, we talk about it. I think the most important thing is to show that we believe. I think we showed in Game 4. If not, if we wouldn't believe, we probably wouldn't have won that game. So I think obviously the talk is easy to talk about it, but then showing it is another thing. I think we showed it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,The change is we needed to win the game. I think we didn't play our best the first three games. So we had to change something and play better in Game 4.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"At this point in the season, a lot of things going on. If I'm playing, I'm fine. No worries."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think everyone. Everyone. In the preseason, that was our key discussion, how to talk on defense. When we put it together and we play good defense, everybody is talking. Communication is a big part of our success on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Not really. Just happy being a father. It's been the best thing in my life. So that's it. Just being happy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,It was a very special moment. I know they are both -- I think they are very proud of their sons. So they are happy that we're happy on the court together.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"We have a great group, resilient group, and we don't like to lose. We do our best to prepare each and every night, each and every game, and we look forward to the next game on the schedule."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just by being disciplined. Controlling the pace. Felt like there was a lot of stoppages in Game 4 where they were blowing the whistle a lot. But we want to get up and create more of a pace to the game, and I think that helps dictate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we are ready for Game 5. I think that's the best answer that I got. I think that we're ready. We're at home, and we're looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's definitely a blessing to be here, to represent the Celtics, my family, the organization, the community, our greater community. It's an honor that I don't take lightly. So just to come out every night and play for something, for what I represent, I think that matters. My relationship with Boston has grown. I've been here for almost nine years now, since I was 18, 19 years old. I've grown up. I've become a man here. Boston is special. I'm looking forward to Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just that you can't take it for granted, and it's going to be difficult. You're going to have to fight and just stay in the moment. That's what matters the most. We come out and be a team. Win as a team, lose as a team. Just come out and be the best versions of ourselves. That's the only experience that you can really experience that you can really speak from in the playoffs. At this level, you have some very talented basketball players who are going to be on the floor, and you've got to bring it every single night. And if you don't, you can see what happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"This is what we all work for. We are at the precipice of completing what we set out to do at the beginning of the season. So I think it's not difficult to get everybody in that locker room on the same page right now. It just needs to remind everybody that it's just one possession at a time. We do it together and we fight like our lives depends on it, and I think we'll be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,A simple way an ass kicking. Thats the simplest way right there.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we felt good, felt confident. Just didnt play the way weve been playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Not exactly. But, as weve seen today, they just played harder, and thats unacceptable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that they played harder. Every loose ball, 50-50 ball, they got to it. Honestly, the turnovers, missed shots -- combined thats not a winning recipe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. Like you said, a year ago this time, we were down 0-3 and we were essentially fighting for our lives. So very short answer, yeah, we understand what it's like from their point of view, and you know, they came out super aggressive. They played extremely fast and took more shots than we did. You know, they were really concentrating on attacking the offensive glass. They got way more rebounds than we did. So, you know, they played harder tonight. Obviously, we didn't shoot the ball well at all. It's something that we can learn from."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Give them credit. They played well tonight and we didn't. We had the right mindset and right intentions. We wanted to come out and play super well and win, but it just didn't go that way tonight. But, you know, we are fortunate. We get another opportunity on Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, not to harp on it too much. It happened. We can't change what happened tonight. You know, we always say you lose by two or you lose by 30 they all count the same. But we do need to be better. We're not making any excuses. We need to be better, and we will. We will be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think we were a little -- I think this is the most stagnant that we've been this series and the worst job of owning our space on the offensive end and doing what we wanted to do instead of what they were forcing us to do. And, you know, we did a great job of that the first three games, and this one, we didn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think it starts on the defensive end for us. We didn't get many stops. So they were allowed to set their defense up, and just naturally, when you're scoring at a high rate, you feel good about yourself. Your energy is higher. Tend to probably play better defense. So it all starts on the defensive end. We've just got to do a much better job containing them, making it tougher, and getting stops."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"A little bit of both. You have to, to move on from it, win or a loss. We're obviously going to watch film and see a lot of things that we need to clean up and do better. But you can't worry about it too much because we have another game on Monday. Like I said, not making any excuses. We've got to be a lot better, and I believe that we will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think it's going to be as loud as it's ever been, in my seven years of being a Celtic. Excited to go back home. Celebrate Father's Day on Sunday and compete for a championship on Monday. So it should be a lot of fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's not quite there, but we're going to make him available. But we're only going to use him in very specific instances if necessary."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just have an understanding of the environment. So at the end of the day, both teams have to keep the same edge and same chip on their shoulder. But you can't be distracted by anything. It really doesn't matter what kind of game it is. If you don't run back on defense, you can't win. If you don't rebound, you can't win. If you don't execute, you can't win. So just focusing on the details, the effort, the execution, all the things that go into winning regardless if it's preseason, regular season, postseason, or the Finals. The process towards winning remains the same. We just have to hammer that home and for however long it takes, stick to that process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Not quite there. He's available but only in very specific situational instances.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah. He's not quite there. He's available. We'll use him in very specific instances laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I haven't really thought about that. Focused on Game 4. One of my favorite places in the world, so that's it for now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, I have different routines, whether home or away, but they are relatively the same. Yeah, about the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think obviously having an understanding of the environment and what we are trying to accomplish. But I think we've done that throughout most of the season when we've been able to dominate the transitions and the margins of the game, and when we've played well and not played well, still give ourselves a chance because of the margins and the discipline in these things. Dallas is a great opponent because they test your discipline, like every single possession, and the second that you're not where you're supposed to be or you don't execute your angles properly, they take advantage of it. So our opponent has forced us to work to be more disciplined, and we have to stay that way for however long the series continues."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"You can definitely take something from it but at the same time, I thought Dallas played great. Give a lot of credit to them. You know, all their guys, whoever went in, well-balanced. Thought they played with a ton of energy and physicality. You've got to give them that. And they are a great team, and that's Dallas. That's the reason why they are here when they play like that. But you can definitely take some stuff from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"They did a great job flying around, making indecision on whether to shoot it or drive and their multiple efforts. And I thought their five men did a great job protecting the paint. Whenever we went in for a layup, they had multiple guys contesting. I thought they did a great job flying around on the defensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I don't know, always in situations like this, it always goes back to us. But you have to give Dallas credit. They played well. They played really, really well. And that's the reason why that they're in this, is because when they play like that. So I thought they just outplayed us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Preparation doesn't guarantee an automatic success. And so I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn't think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder. You have to prepare to put yourself in the best possible position, but it doesn't guarantee anything. At the end of the day, we have to just maintain our process and get ready for Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Anytime there's two-on-ones and little indecisions, they do a great job cutting behind you and wedging under and getting in. I thought Lively was great in that. We had 26 misses in the first half and only two offensive rebounds, and they had more. So we've got to be better in our defensive rebounding, and we have to be better getting offensive rebounds when we miss."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I learned that Dallas is a great team and you're going to have to earn it. There's a lot of stuff that we can control. We'll go back on the film and we'll watch that, and we'll really try to be disciplined and control it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't know. I thought Dallas played really -- the more I said it, because you have to give them credit. It's not about us. It's about our opponent and having respect for them. And you have to give them credit for how well they played, and that's the most important thing. So it's less about us and more about how they played. They played well. They played hard. We have to be more disciplined in how we defend and attack them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,It wasn't as good as Dallas's was. I thought theirs was a lot better.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,I'm not comfortable. We got to win. We got to have a lot more wins. We got to win a lot more of the little battles. Got to stay disciplined. We just got to replicate what we did this game. Do it the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"A mix between a bunch of fruits -- not vegetables -- bunch of fruits, and just some recovery stuff. Making sure by body don't cramp or anything like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"They're my family. We've developed a lot of trust with one another, a lot of chemistry. That trust just comes down to if you get blown by, they know I have their back. Just at the same time, I know if I got blown by, I got people behind me to back me up. It's really just doing whatever up can to make sure whenever one steps, we're all stepping with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,It's for her. She helped me make it. She's going to help me make a lot more. She helped me make the free throw. She helped me make reads. I'm just happy for having Luka pass me the ball in that position. I'm happy I knocked it down. Just got to be able to make the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"If they leave me open in the corner, I'm going to get them up, for sure. It's just having that trust. Luka is going to give me the ball. As soon as I shot it, he kind of jumped for joy when it went in. Just having that reaction from my teammates is just amazing. Makes you want to just learn, just practice and just do more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Whatever doesn't kill you really makes you stronger. No matter how many times you get hit, knocked down, get up, get up harder than you got knocked down. Hit them harder than they hit you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"As I jogged down, I slowly heard it. It kept getting louder and louder. Whenever you have the fans hyped like that, backing you up, it makes you want to play that much more free, with that much more energy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I'm happy he was able to get out there, feel the energy, feel everything about the experience. He hasn't been able to step on the floor for a long time now because he has been hurt. Just going out there, I was telling him to slow down, just enjoy it, feel your way through this game. Don't rush anything, just feel your way through the game, find little holes, absorb it all. I know he did. I know he's thinking about a lot of things, but I got a lot of trust in O Max."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I wouldn't say it's comfortability. I feel like we go out there and we play like we're desperate. That's the mentality we need to have in these games, going out there doing whatever you can to win. No matter if you're diving out of bounds, diving at the ball, chesting up with somebody, trying to be aggressive and strong. A lot of this playoff season, playoff series, has just been finding out who we are, finding how much can we get hit and then throw one back. It's definitely been an enjoyable time to just see my teammates and myself just grow and adapt with one another with what's going on on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, he trusts us. He trusts us to know he's going to play the best defense he can with as much energy as he's got. If they get by him, he knows we're going to back him up. He knows exactly what we're going to do and how we have his back. Only thing I told him, Look, going out there, first two times you get fouled, don't say nothing to the refs. That's all I got. Just please don't do that, and I'll make sure you get open, make sure you're going be comfortable on the offensive and defensive end. So just knowing that whenever he is going out there playing defense and he's locked in on defense, he just makes everything fall into place better on the offensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I wouldn't say we're overly happy. We enjoyed this win. But we're not jumping for joy. We got to win. We do what we need to do for this game. Now it's getting into Game 5. We're going into another hostile environment. Now we just got to take from what we did this game, learn to how they're going to adapt to this game, do whatever we can to emulate, make this happen again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a really good question in the sense of the talk is, you know, no different than 1, 2 or 3. You know, we have a game plan. We've got to play faster. We've got to guard the three. The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about the record or the series is 3-0, somewhere in this game, there's going to be a point where either team is going to have to make a stand or they let go of the rope. And so that's just human nature. And so if it happens to be us in the sense we are down or we're fighting to get back in the game, there's going to be a point, if there's going to be a fight, or do we just concede. Or vice versa, where Boston goes, we've got another one on Monday. That's what -- there will be a point in this game where someone is going to have to make a stand or they let go especially of the rope. We'll see when that point comes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think when you talk about the three games, getting off to a good start is one, and then the fight at the end. You know, we're playing from behind, and we have to play perfect. These are positive things. But again, we have to play with pace. And somewhere between the second quarter and third quarter we tend to just walk the ball, and that's the benefit to Boston. Tonight we have to leave the -- the gas tank has to be empty at the pace of not walking but running for 48 minutes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think -- I don't get involved with the medical. So I just repeat questionable or probable or whatever he's taking. So I let that -- that's between medical and the player. So I can't comment about what -- if he taking a shot. But injuries are part of the game, and it's June. Everybody's sore and tired mentally. And so it's about survival. It's about being able to understand if you've been here before, you have to train to play to June. And so these are a lot of lessons, not just for Luka but a lot of my guys are learning. And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Great question. I think when you talk about our bench, we need everybody to score. And then when you talk about our team, we need everybody to score more points. It's not just our bench. It's not just Luka and Ky scoring. We need everybody to pitch in. We are getting great looks. Unfortunately we just haven't made them. So tonight hopefully is the night that everybody will be able to score. But our bench has been, you know, someone that has helped us win in the playoffs, and we are going to need them tonight. Someone off the bench, Maxi, D-Live, Josh, Exum, someone has to be able to step up and make an open shot for us tonight, and we truly believe that will happen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at today's athlete, the game of sport is not to be perfect. It's just, you know, to win. And when you look at what's come out here in the last day or so, if you've watched the Mavs, Luka has improved his defense. But we are asking him, or some are asking him, to be a shutdown defender. Well, he's never been on an All-Defensive Team, but he's been on five All-Pro Teams, first team. So that means he's one of the top five players in the world, and he's playing the game the right way where he can find open guys. But when you're on the biggest stage, there's got to be -- someone's got to poke a hole. This will only make the great ones better. When you look at, we talked about it yesterday, with LeBron, Michael, the greats, the G.O.A.T.s, they all were poked at and they came back stronger and better. I truly believe Luka will come back stronger and better. Some criticize that he could never get this far. But he's here. And unfortunately as a team, he said it best We win together and we lose together. And that's -- we lost three in a row. We are trying to find a way tonight to win. But sometimes when you are a free agent in the media business, you've got to say something crazy to get a new contract, or likes, or clicks."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"No, I think it's just everybody has -- this is a free country. Everybody has the right to their opinion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is a special group when you talk about that group in that locker room. They protect one another. They play for one another. They play the game the right way. They cheer for one another. And so is there extra? I don't think there's going to be extra. I think the motivation right now is to get off to a good start and find a way to get a win. But nothing changes about the way the group feels about Luka. Tonight I expect everybody to play their A Game. I think sometimes we -- you know, the Celtics are a good team. Let's not forget that. It's not that we are not playing defense or it's been blowouts. It's just been a couple mistakes that they have taken advantage of that we will learn from as we go forward, and if we are ever in this situation again, hopefully we can use that experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"D Live was great. His energy was great. His ability to give us second opportunities. He displayed his range tonight with the corner three. He was really good. He's been good. Giving us second opportunities, picking up a foul, getting the offensive rebound, was needed. I thought he did a really good job this evening."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We had to play our A game. It was this or we go on vacation. I thought the group did a great job of not pressing, letting the game happen. The flow was there. We've done this in the first three games. It's just we haven't been able to capitalize. We made the mistakes, and they've capitalized on it. They shot the three well. We tried to keep them off the free-throw line tonight, not give them second opportunities. I thought they did a really good job of being able to execute the game plan and let the game come to us. We made awesome shots. Our role players stepped up and made some threes. That's what we needed tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he was great. He's been great. Some would say differently. He's averaging over 25 in this series, I think. He's playing at a very high level. I don't know so much respond. He's been doing everything for us on the offensive end and defensive end. I thought he played his game tonight. He didn't force anything. I thought he was rebounding and let other guys... With the pace, we talked about it, we got to play faster. I thought he set the pace for us tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought they were great. It was a carryover from Game 3. I thought the energy group that ended in Game 3, fourth quarter, the group, energy and pace on both ends. Defensively we got stops. Offensively we got into the paint where we could capitalize. I thought Josh's energy has been great. The defense, again, in this series has been really good. It's just for us, it comes down to not making a mistake at the wrong time, and tonight we didn't do that. We capitalized on their mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It thought it was great. He was Luka. He's been Luka. There wasn't a different Luka out there. He played at a high level. He was great. He's been great. He's one of the best players in the world. As much as we want to criticize, he's a hell of a player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, the score. It's real simple. We don't have to complicate this. This isn't surgery. Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate. Understand, we made a stand. We were desperate. We got to continue to keep playing that way understand they're trying to find a way to close the door. The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight you saw that. They let go of the rope, you know, pretty early."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"No, he was in the right spot. He took it from there. He can shoot. That's the next step for his development, is being able to shoot the three. He's young. But as a 20-year-old, he's grown up in the AAU circuit where in high school, he could shoot, he could handle. He'd tell you he played point guard. His ability to be able to bring the ball, being able to shoot the three is the next step for him. He has all the skill set. Right now, for the role we need him to do, is do what he did tonight offensive rebound, change shots and be able to guard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's who we've been all season. Exum has played at a high level for us all season. He's been able to run the offense. He stepped up and made big shots for us to win. Then I thought tonight even the one he shot from out of bounds, he made it, that could easily have changed his confidence. He was aggressive while he was out on the floor. He was great. We're going to need that on the road."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, again, we are desperate. The ball starts to move. Guys are not overthinking it. Again, being able to make some threes tonight from our role players were huge when you talk about D Jones, Exum and then D Live. Just understanding that's who we've been all season. We can shoot with the best of them. Tonight we displayed that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think, again, we have nothing to lose going to Boston. That mindset of being aggressive. Then to answer the first part of your question, Luka, as we know, can play defense. You saw that tonight. Some of the criticism that he's had here of late, for whatever reason, talked about his defense. I think he stepped up and was there. He knows in Boston he's going to be right back in the pick-and-roll, so he's going to have to compete and play defense again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought everybody who participated today was ready. I thought O Max, as a rookie coming off of injury, I thought he did a good job getting his first minutes in the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just by putting it into perspective what we're up against. History is going to be made either way. We'd like to be on the right side of it. It just comes from the same sentiment, same phrase I was using the other day, just putting our best foot forward. We felt like Game 3 we had a good chance to close out that game to at least put is in a competitive spot. We waited until Game 4 to ultimately play our best game. Took long enough for all of us to get to the party together and to play for each other the way we did tonight. But it's definitely a possibility that we can replicate it. We understand we're going against the same great Boston team that is going to make it tough. We're going into their home den. We have another opportunity to extend the season. That's all we can ask for. We handled our business tonight. But the job is still an uphill battle, and we understand that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It was how we started off the game. Our ability to go home, get some rest, not having the same 48 hours to get our bodies ready and recover. So it felt like it was pretty much the regular season in terms of that aspect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I think he made a few people eat their words. In a healthy way -- I'll say that in a healthy way. I don't want to curse up here or anything like that, get into any unnecessary beef, right, between us as players and the media. I think this is his first opportunity and first taste of what it's like to be on this stage, and to not play up to your capabilities or be out there toward the end of the game where every mistake is magnified. I think that's probably what I'm really referring to, is when every mistake is magnified, there is going to be a response. That's your guys' job to give us your criticism. We go home and deal with it in a healthy way, hopefully. I think with Luka, like I've been reiterating to the guys, stay off social media as best you can, man. Enjoy the moment we're in. It's not about making it this far. It's figuring out of the little nuances to get wins on this stage. That's what it's about for us as competitors and that's where our focus should be. He responded very well. I expected it. I think a lot of people expected it that have seen Luka and known Luka. Just didn't know how it was going to happen. He made some things happen tonight that I was very proud of him. He grew. That's what we've been talking about, too, since the beginning of the series, is our growth, us trending in the right direction, figuring out how we get wins together as a group with all those external factors still going on. How do you still lock in, how do you still focus in, breathe through some of those mistakes. I think he did a great job of that tonight. Hopefully, we can still extend this series going into Game 5. But we still know we have to play our best and control what we can control."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Yeah. Crazy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's taken time, I tell you that. It's difficult because, as a competitor, you try not to display all your emotions out there to give an edge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Rightfully so, yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I think it shows you how important it is to have quality leaders in the locker room and somebody that has been through it, somebody that can talk through it, and also somebody that's more than willing to sacrifice themselves to take the bullets and the brunt of the responsibility. He knows how important it is for us to focus on the right things. We can't be focused on answering all these unfair, critical questions. Some of them may be fair, right? But if you're not necessarily out there playing with us, it's going to be hard for us to connect if you're talking s--- about one of our teammates. We're not going to go for it. I think that's what you're seeing. Not just from us, but our head coach. He's dealt with his fair share of criticism from some of you guys in this room, some guys in the past. Some of you criticize him as a coach, rightfully so, like I said. I think if it goes over a certain boundary, you're going to see a real humans step up and protect their brother or sister. I think that's what you saw from J Kidd. I am proud of him. I have the same sentiment. That's out little brother right there. He's in the Finals. He's going to make mistakes. That's also why I kind of had that kind of peaceful sentiment about me after the game. I'm not about to go up to Luka and say, It's all your fault. That's not how it works in our locker room. We dang sure don't want to start those bad habits now. I've been on teams where we have allowed the media or opinions to infiltrate what we have going on, and it has not worked out well. I think if we put our best foot forward and focus on the things we can control, we got a good thing going here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, if you're familiar with D Live's game, you know in high school he was shooting those threes. He was on a pretty good team that ended up winning a few championships together. D Live had an expanded game, sort of to say, when he was in high school. It's crazy. I was watching highlights not too long ago."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I think what we have to also account for is we're in a very physical game. When you're getting beat up like that out there every single play, you're going to have something to say to the refs. In Luka's case, his relationship with the refs is not always the healthiest during games. The referees are humans, too. We have to respect what they do. They're a big part of this game, too. It could sway either way. I think what you're seeing is him just taking accountability as best he can at this point in his life. He's a young person, still trying to figure it out. I give him that grace. Also, we have to give him a little tough love where we let him know and reiterate you got to stay off those guys a little bit. I think it's just lessons being learned. When he is locked in like that, not paying attention to the refs, he's a huge, impactful player for us, and a great leader for us. We want him to stay consistent on that and not be too hard on himself either. If he gets a tech, so be it. No one is batting an eye. If we're trying to get back into the game and we need the refs, there has to be a different perspective, different approach you got to take. Sometimes a good conversation works with the refs. Sometimes eye-to-eye conversation works with them. When you're s--- talking them, MF'ing them all the time, it can get to them too. I'm not saying we're all perfect, but we have to use everything to our advantage on a positive note."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I think it was more about Dallas. You know, I felt like they were the better team tonight, clearly. They played much better, and you've got to give them credit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I felt like we came out determined. They were the better team. They were the team that was playing harder. He's right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we have an opportunity here to be better, and it all starts with us going over this film and having a good practice session and understanding the opportunity we have in front of us. So that's what we're going to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I just know, there could have been some of that. Ultimately, you know, I felt like they were the better team tonight. We can say all these things about us. They played much better than us. They clearly outplayed us, and that's tough to take but that's the reality."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I don't know specifically. It just seemed like a lot of stuff was going their way, and I'm just eager to just look at this film and get together and see how we can be better. The one thing I can tell you about our group is that time and time again, we've responded any time we have adversity, and this is an opportunity that we have here front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. We definitely have to be better. Have to be more active and make sure that we're a little more aware of him, and it's something that I expect us to be better come Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I feel like every series kind of has a life of its own. But yeah, they were in a position that their backs were against the wall, and they did what they were supposed to do. It is hard to win on the road. And even though we've had a lot of success this postseason on the road, you know, they had the momentum. They kept it going, and that was a big difference. Their crowd really rallied behind them and I feel like that helped them throughout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's hard. It's a playoff series. Teams are going back and forth. Usually, you know, I've been in a lot of these, and usually by the second game, you're making adjustments. Third game, you're making another adjustment, and that's kind of how it is. And for us, we've had the first three games, we didn't really make any adjustments. So today, they did something. We have to see what we can -- how we can be better and prepare for it. That's kind of where we're at right now. But, you know, it's the playoffs, and, you know, they are fighting for their lives, and they played better than us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,I think we always fall back on our work and preparation and understanding what we need to do. It's not going to be any different now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's a good question. Understanding that it's one game. You know, after we won Game 1, we put that behind us. You know, Game 2, kind of same thing and so on, and we are at this point now. You know, we have to take some things that we can be better at and try to fix them, and then you know, others kind of throw them out and just kind of do that and make sure that we come out and we play Celtics basketball. I think ultimately that's what it comes down to for us, and there's a lot of things that we can control and that I expect us to be much better on Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Take care of the things that we can control. Got to fight for rebounds. We've got to, me in particular, not turn the ball over and just be aggressive. Be the more desperate team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I mean, I wouldn't say throw it away. We've got to learn from it. Things that we have to go back and watch. Again, see the things that we should have controlled and done better doing that. But going back and watching film and getting better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"In particular, no. I think they let me play one-on-one, so whenever I drive, I think they all kind of space out and let me try to play one-on-one at the basket. Just got to do better playing off my teammates and finishing at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"We learn from wins, too. Wins we have opportunities to get better. Again, same thing with losses. So not sure it changes much. Got to get home. Get our rest, hydrate and lock back in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think winning is hard. I think winning at any game is hard. But winning Game 4 of the NBA Finals is pretty damn hard. So no, I think they came out desperate and I think they punched us in the mouth, and we couldn't kind of recover the way we wanted to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I guess a massive win would be -- I don't know. I think role players came in and they felt good. Obviously they are at home. But things that we have to control, we'll do our best to do that and come back at home and do the best we can to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know. I don't know. Even though I've done it. You've got to do it together as a team. Everybody has to be clicking and being, again, the more desperate team. We've just got to go back home. I think locking into tendencies, locking into the game plan, and I think we'll be okay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I thought we got a lot of good shots. I think a lot of them didn't fall. A lot of the plays we made before didn't go in the hoop. You saw a couple go in and out. Again, just a couple plays didn't go our way. So credit to Dallas. They played extremely hard. They played desperate, and we've got to do the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think the series is we are up 3-1 going back to Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"That was a butt whupping. Thats it. They just beat us. Not much to it, honestly. They just beat us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Its a learning lesson, for sure. Got to show up and show out every night. Theyre not going to roll over. Theyre down 3-1 now. Theyre desperate, so theyre not going to roll over. Theyre not going to make it easy on us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, Im sure well break it down, learn from it and take what we need to get better at and any carry it on to Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,Be better. About it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,Cant wait. Wish we could do it right now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think for me, it's just come in and do what I do with my minutes. I think obviously Luka creates a lot of attention. Just using that to my advantage to get downhill. I've been super confident in my shot all year. Unfortunate that one of them was taken away. I just have to stay confident and keep shooting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, I think just the energy that we showed throughout the team. Even when stuff didn't go our way, it wasn't heads down. It was next possession, next possession. That's something we've kind of preached the whole series. I think we were finally able to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I mean, you said it. A lot of the times guys go through ups and downs. It's just about getting back in the gym, doing our craft, what we know. Whether that's lifting, shooting, extra reps, anything. You see everyone on this team doing that. And it shows on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, no. I think obviously Luka has to hold himself to a high standard. Him fouling out doesn't give us the best position to win. Obviously we need him on the court, and he knows that. I know he's going to, as a competitor, hold himself accountable. We did, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"One of the biggest things is I go on the court and I think I'm going to be on Tatum or Brown. Kyrie is, No, I've got him. I think that's huge. I can press the ball, be up and play on the help side. I mean, just for Kyrie to kind of step up and say, I'm going to take that defensive challenge, it's huge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Like I said, there's a lot of ups and downs that go through a series. Just the Playoffs in general. I think we knew kind of what we can do and how we can be. Obviously, we know not every game is going to be like that. I think if we stick to kind of who we are as a team and stay positive, we just need to take one game at a time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think criticism is always going to come when we lose. I think if we won a game or two, the criticism isn't as bad. J Kidd, he played, so he understands it. All competitors, they're going to take it on the chin, come out. That's the challenge that we have to do every game. Obviously, we watch it because we're on our phones a lot. It's just coming out and playing our basketball, and that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think it's contagious. I come in, I do it. Everyone starts to build that pace. Everyone's running their lanes. I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just helps out my team. We were locked in, especially on the defense end. We played with pace. It helped them. I'm here to help them in every way I can. We just got to play like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it doesn't change anything. Like I said at the beginning of the series, it's first to four. We going to believe until the end. So we just got to keep going. I have big belief in this team that we can do it, so we just got to keep believing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,It's big. It's basketball. It's five people on the floor. So that's huge for us. Everybody played with a lot of energy. That's how we got to do it. We got to think the same way in Game 5 in Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't know what I learn of myself. Ask me the next day, I'll come up with the answer. I don't know really right now smiling. But it's going to take everything. It's going to take energy -- especially energy -- because it's late in the season. We played a lot of games. We got to stay together and locked in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"No, he didn't say anything to me specifically. But that speaks a lot about him. He always has players' backs. He always support us. That's a big thing, to have a coach like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Big-time, man. I think people forget he's a rookie. He's a rookie doing this stuff. He's been amazing the whole season. Just watching him grow was unbelievable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,All right. 1-for-1 -- he's 100 in the Playoffs.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,I don't even know how to answer that. Next question.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Give credit to Dallas. I think they played hard physically, and then they dominated the glass. I think that was the key that put a lot of pressure on us. And then we didn't make shots tonight, and I think that's where, you know, we allowed them to play free, once we get them multiple opportunities to make shots, and then also we didn't hit shots on the other end. We're going to look at the film and see where we can better, and then go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's a great opportunity to respond. Give credit to Dallas. They came out and they played with force, and they played great. We just regroup. We keep our same mentality, and we come out and get ready to fight in another battle on our home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"We learn from it. We take it. We don't dismiss it. We're going to learn from it. We're going to see how and why, exactly where the game was won and lost. And then we take those experiences and then we come out and we play like our life depends on it. Because it does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Close-out games are hard. Close-out games are tough. They always have been like that, and you've got to have extreme focus. You've got to come out and meet their intensity to finish things out. So we didn't do that tonight. Give credit to Dallas. I thought they played extremely well. Those guys, they crashed, they rebounded and they played with force. Some of those other guys stepped up. We've got to be better and we've got to have some of our guys step up, and that's what it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like the pace slowed down a little bit which allowed them to dictate what they wanted to do. I think we have to continue to keep the pace but have some more poise. Just see where we can be better. We'll watch film and we'll see. Right now, it feels raw, so we've just got to look at film and go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"These are the moments that can make you or break you. We have to reassemble. We have to look at it and learn from it, and then we've got to embrace it and attack it. It's going to be hard to do what we're trying to do. We didn't expect anything to be easy, but it's no reason to lose our head. Tip your cap to Dallas. They came out and played well, and we've just got to be better on the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure as of yet. But we're going to watch it. We're going to learn from it. As of now, we've just got to be better. We have to meet their intensity. It's the NBA playoffs. It's the Finals. Looking forward to the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah. He was excited for me to be here. I think he was like, I remember watching you when I was with the select team at USA, and I think he just saw something in me then, that he believed I could help us win games. He's a great basketball mind, and it just goes to show you never really know who's watching."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I remember he told me about what it was going to be like to play for the Celtics and the crowd, the city, everything. It's just been so much better. I love playing there and just competing in the TD Garden. Hardy was amazing for me. He's an amazing coach. I think he kind of undersold it a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, it's playing with great players. They put me in a position to be in those moments, and they trust me. Just try to be confident throughout it all and just trust the work that I've put in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say he was a big talker. He just gets it done. Both sides of the court, just his physicality, just impacts the game in so many different ways. Just does literally everything on the court, and just does it at a really high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"No, I mean, you knew he was a big-time competitor. You don't guard the way he guards and not be a big-time competitor. But you don't really see all the little things he does until you see it like day in and day out and just the way he just impacts winning every second he's out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think we just locked in. I don't know exactly what it is. But we're just locked in. We know what's at stake. We understand that close-out games are the toughest, and we just come with an extra edge. It's going to be even harder tomorrow, and we've got to be even better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think from our experiences over the past couple of years, the thing that we've really gotten a lot better at is not relaxing, not being complacent. From game to game or series to series, we always want more. Maybe in recent years we took things for granted at some points or were happy to make it to certain rounds, where now we're not satisfied. Even now up 3-0, nobody is celebrating or anything. We still feel like there's a lot more that we can do. There's a lot more that we want to do. From that standpoint, just not being complacent and everybody just wanting more and being true to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"You said Summer League? I was excited to finally put on an NBA jersey. I was young. I was 19. I was overwhelmed. Everything was new to me, from being at the new practice facility. I remember going through Summer League practice with -- JB was on the team, obviously, and learning from him and learning from the assistant coaches. Jerome Allen was there Micah Shrewsberry was one of the coaches. It was a hell of an experience, in Utah and in Vegas. I was just so happy to be in the NBA at the time that -- I was really a kid. It was a great experience, and obviously we've grown a lot since then. But I was just so happy to be there and put on that jersey for the first time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, ever since I've been in the NBA, especially with the Celtics, everybody knows we only hang up championship banners, and it's been a while since we've won one. Ever since '08, the goal is to win another one every single year. Gotten close plenty of times. It's just an honor. It's a honor to wear this jersey. It's an honor to follow in the footsteps of some of the best players ever. Being a part of Celtics history entails that you've got to win a championship. Every kid growing up playing basketball dreams about being in the Finals, dreams about winning a championship. I'm no different than anybody else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I credited last year a lot to the success that we're having this season. We were so consumed with getting back to the Finals, in a good way, but I think especially when we got to the Playoffs, we were just ready to get back to June. In some ways skipping steps. Those series took longer than they maybe should have, and we acknowledge that. We could have closed games out a lot earlier. You find yourself in a hole down 0-3, the margin for error is so small. Last year, we really believed that we could take it one game at a time and come back from that series. But last year was a great learning experience. For one, to not take things for granted. You're never promised to make it back to the Finals. I think each and every person this year has came into the season with a different mindset. I think it has truly shown that we don't take things for granted, and we approach every single day the same. We're trying to get better, and we're as hungry as we've ever been."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Actually, yeah, somebody did walk me around the old practice facility in Waltham and showed me all the banners and the history. I was born in '98, so I didn't really know about all the championships before. I knew Bill Russell won a lot. I knew Bird had a couple. But I only ever saw '08, and then when they lost in 2010. I learned a lot about the history of the game, the history of the Celtics. I would say the first legend I met was Paul Pierce. I met him during that -- it might have been Summer League or my first training camp he was around for a few days. That was the first Celtics legend I really got to talk to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think our ability to go over situational basketball during practice. Joe and the coaching staff, they do a great job of showing us a lot of different things throughout the season of how games end, whether it's teams being up six, do you foul, or closing out quarters and how that can have an effect for the start of the next quarter. So going over situational basketball in practice and in shootarounds and understanding what we want to do in those moments, what plays and reads we want to go over in late-game situations, so when those moments do come about throughout the game, we're comfortable. We know what we're trying to run, what we're trying to get to, the different options from each set. Just our ability to translate the things that we go over in practice to the game and do it without skipping a beat."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I didn't know that. That would be really cool. But you know, you guys will probably say we didn't play anybody to get here. So we'll just have to do it again next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I really don't listen to a lot of them. I don't really have a favorite quote. But I just think he says a lot of things that are -- like a lot of things that people don't usually say, but they have great meaning behind them, and they resonate with our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's a great player. Just tried to make things tough, make him hit tough one-on-one buckets over and over again. That's kind of what we're living with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just like to show the world that I'm a good defender and I can guard some of the best guys in the world, especially those two. They're the best. Just doing my job, staying in front, making things tough. I try to take pride in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's tough when you're playing limited minutes and he hasn't played at times, so when you see a guy like that hit a three that's been -- he works his tail off. It's great to see. It's rewarding. He performed really well yesterday guarding, and then obviously I just thought that three was a big momentum shift."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's the hardest thing in any sport, but especially basketball. Playing limited minutes, going back and forth, limited shots, it's not easy. It can be mentally really difficult. The strongest people, they prevail, and they come up when they're needed most."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He just gets his work in. He's been able to stay level-headed through the ups and downs, and it's been great to see. He's hit really big shots, and he hit three last night. But just his work. He works on his shot all the time. It's been good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,The job ain't finished. We ain't celebrating like we won a championship yet. We've still got one more to do. We weren't really talking about anything but getting it done.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's really himself. He's like authentic to himself. We all appreciate that. Like he's not trying to be somebody he's not. So I think that's kind of like the sicko side of it. He's different, but we respect that. Then the basketball genius, you can learn a lot from him as to how he sees the offensive side of things, the play calling, the game management, all that. He's elite in that. I've personally learned a lot from him, and I think our whole group has."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The first one, I think our analytics department does a tremendous job. Dave Sparks and the gang is a conduit to that on the coaching staff. We have a ton of conversations about what makes sense from an analytical perspective and how do you constantly find small ways to give yourself the best chance to win, but also increase your chances of winning. In our department, that just makes the most sense to us. Gives us the best chance to win and allows us to control the variables of the game, especially when teams don't have a timeout, which they didn't last night. So it's a credit to them, just bringing constant trends within the game that I feel like give us an advantage and increase winning any chance you can go. It's a little bit, one percent better, save a half a point, save a point, save .9 of a point, it makes a big difference over time. Second one, I think just having an understanding from a player, just looking at the lens from a player's perspective. I think sometimes when you become a coach you look at it from a coach's perspective, but at the end of the day the world revolves around the guys and how they view things and the lens with which they look at things. So you have to alter your communication. You have to alter your schedule. You have to alter things that put the players in the best possible decision to succeed. So a lot of the decisions that I make, it's like, what would I have wanted as a player. We have a ton of former players on staff that are able to help with that, so I think that's the biggest thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I would hope he does not feel undervalued by us because I think he has done a lot of tremendous things as a player and as a person. So no, I think he's one of the ultimate values. I think to have a guy like him be able to dominate the intangibles of the game on both ends of the floor is amazing to us. We wouldn't be in this position without any of our guys, and he's included in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the thing you just can't take for granted in the game today is a coach's greatest gift is a group of guys that want to be coached, want to be led, that also empower themselves. So I think at the end of the day, just appreciate the fact that we have an environment where learning and coaching is important, and getting better and developing is important. You can't be a good coach if your players don't let you -- you can't be an effective coach. Everything starts with them, their ability to buy in, their ability to execute the things. As a staff, we're grateful. We talk about it every day. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be here. So it's on them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The first question is part of life, like any situation you're in is going to help you for the next situation. So we should be able to take everything that we learned as a team, as an organization, last year, this year, so every experience should help you prepare for that. As far as blocking out the noise, at the end of the day we're the most vulnerable in this. So we have to remain that. We have to remain with a sense of urgency. We have to have an understanding of our environment. We have to know that we're just as vulnerable as anybody else in this situation, and how we handle that will determine our fate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, not at all. I think coaching is understanding that you can't win without the players. I don't care. I just want to win. I want to do it with good people, and we have an opportunity to do that. There's four rounds left in this fight, and however long it takes, whatever it takes, we'll see how it goes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No. No, I think that's a rather passive way to look at things. I think at the end of the day, we have to continue to do what we do. Kristaps has gotten better from yesterday to today. He's fighting like hell to play. But it's going to be up to us to protect him and to make sure that it's in the best interest for him as a player and as a person. Going into what's best for a player and a person has nothing to do with where we're at from a basketball standpoint."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, saying that diminishes the other great locker rooms that you've been in. I think everybody in that locker room would say they've been a part of other good locker rooms. I think a lot of it has to do with timing, but I think at the end of the day we're in a situation right now where everybody is on the same page, that winning is the most important thing, and that we're going to do whatever it takes for however long it takes. We just have to remain in that mindset that it's everybody's responsibility to impact winning. As long as we stay there, we have an opportunity, we've got a chance. So I think it's focusing on that is what you've got to be grateful for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just building retention and learning how to understand the why and building an awareness to your environment. You can't make decisions and eliminate emotion if you don't have the facts and you don't have an understanding of your environment and what's going on. Just really trying to put yourself in a situation -- how can we get away from the emotion of your environment and how can you get to the tactical, the facts, the truth of what's going on so that you can adjust accordingly."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It comes down to just being mature about it. You're in a very high-intensity, very high emotional state in this environment, playing in the Finals. Got a lot of people looking at you, a lot of eyes on you. But all you've got to do is just tune that out, focus on what you can control, how much energy you put in, how much effort you're going to put in, how much you're talking, how much you care about the situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I kind of forget how big the nation really is. Hearing people from Washington, from Florida, Maine, California, affecting lives, affecting people who I've never met, who I've never laid eyes on. It just makes you kind of walk with a certain light."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding the mistakes that we've made. Understanding what we did, understanding what we need to do in those moments and just understanding what each and every one of us are thinking. We can't all be on different pages when we're on the floor. We've got to understand. We've got to be one. We've got to understand what each and every one of us is thinking, what we're trying to achieve, what we're trying to do in each possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It was a lot of film. It was a lot of recognition. It was a lot of just talking, understanding we're trying to be on the same page. This is our first NBA Finals for a lot of us, and it's just making sure that we are together. It's going to be the whole world looking at you, the whole world talking bad on us, no matter where you look, no matter if it's on your phone, billboards or just talking to someone down the street. It's just trying to be able to understand that we've all got each other's backs. We're all learning from one another. We're learning from the situation, and we're trying to become better people and better players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding where you are. We're down 3-0. But just because we're down 3-0, it's not finished. It's only going to come down to us putting all we can on the floor. Our heart, our soul. Just trying to come out and win little battles because that's what's going to get us the game, winning the 5050 balls, winning the rebounding game, winning the transition game and then just trying to stop them from what they're trying to do. We're trying to make them play into our game, but we're trying to understand what our game is because we're not on the same page."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, we can't sit here and be like, the ref did this, the ref did that. We can't control that. What we can control is the positions that we're putting ourselves in to get those fouls, understanding that if we're talking and we're getting mad at the referees, they're going to end up -- they're going to get the last laugh. We've got to be able to just be mature, be able to move on from whatever play, whatever call they're going to make on the floor because we're not able to control that. What we're able to do is focus on our reaction to those calls."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, overall I think in sports when it comes to competing you always have to believe in yourself, and that's what we do, too. Even before the Playoffs, I think a lot of people didn't believe we could be here. We stayed together as a team at any time. Obviously, it's not ideal. It's not where we wanted to be, but this is also a great learning process for everybody involved. But overall in sports you keep competing no matter what, so you just approach it in the right way. Our backs are against the wall, obviously, being down 3-0, but we still have to continue to just play hard and believe in ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think our fans have been great all season long, but obviously yesterday, especially when we had the early run at the beginning of the game. They were loud, and then when we made the comeback from 20 points, they always supported us. They're always here for us, and obviously we wanted to take advantage of the home court yesterday. So that's something we have to do tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"No, I love everybody on this team, coaching staff, everybody around the Mavs organization. I've been here for a long time now. I don't truly have a comparison to other teams, but I know it's hard to top the character guys that we have here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Obviously, I still have pain. It's not just gone now. But you make the best of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"We have practices. We analyze tape. We try to see what we have to do better, obviously, and then outside of that, just try to get my mind off a little bit, try to relax and then come back and focus my mind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I wouldn't necessarily say easier, but obviously when your back is against the wall, you can play a little bit more loose and just go out there and fight. You have nothing to lose. But overall I think the pressure remains the same at all times. You just want to win as a team no matter what. It doesn't matter if it's 0-0, whatever. We just still got to continue focusing on what we have to do, and also when we watch tape and analyze what we did, learn from it, also for future purposes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Well, that's a result of how the game goes. I think we just have to create better spacing for Luka and Kyrie to operate and get the right guys involved, and that will also give us better percentages. Also, Boston is playing a little bit different in this series than they have before, a lot of switching, stuff like that. But it's good for us to just analyze and keep improving on what we want to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought Exum did great. We probably looked back at it, we could have probably got him in there a little bit more, but we went with the other guys. We were looking for someone to be able to knock down an open shot. We had good looks that just didn't go down for us. I thought Exum's pace, his ability to get the ball into the paint for those three minutes was good. So hopefully we can get him in the game in Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think we played 11 yesterday. Everybody is on deck. Everybody has to be ready to play. No lineup changes here today. But we'll see what tomorrow brings."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think the history is there for us to learn from, when you look at great players and the struggles. You look at MJ and the struggles that he had against Detroit. You look at some Magic Johnson struggles. You look at LeBron's first time around. It's there to learn from. But as the great ones, they use that going into the next season or the next couple seasons to try to get back there because now they understand experience is a big thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think you talk about playing Game 4. That's it. I thought yesterday we got off to a really good start, and hopefully we can do that again tomorrow. You look at the end of quarters, the end of the first in Game 2 and also here in Game 3, we have to be better. Again, just taking one possession at a time, controlling what you can control, your effort and energy, and just winning the minutes when you're out there. That's all we've talked about today, and that's what we'll talk about tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think Luka is doing -- in this playoff series, when you talk about from the Clippers to today, his defense has improved. But when you look at being involved in every pick-and-roll, there's going to be mistakes that take place. That's just the game of basketball. We've just got to limit those mistakes. But he is involved in every possession. That's what the Celtics are very good at doing, is making sure when they go hunting, they get the guy that they want. And so for us, we've got to do a better job of protecting Luka."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,It was just film.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Both offense and defense. The good things that we did, and then also the things that we've got to improve on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,It was just watching film. We got to see our mistakes and broke it down a little bit for us so we can get ready for Game 4.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Defensively we had a couple breakdowns, and offensively I thought we let it slip away a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Refs are going to do what they are. You can't change that. You've got to play the game the way you've got to play it, no matter what they call."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Get a win. I guess that's everybody's goal, is to get a win. That's my mindset. That's everybody's mindset. I'm pretty sure you're going to see a lot of smiles out here right now. We want to get this win. That's what we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"We believe in each other. We never stop believing in each other. That's just how we are. We trust each other. We've been through a lot. We've been down 30, come back, take a 10-point lead and possibly have lost that game. But we've been through a lot. We've fought as a team, and we're going to keep fighting as a team no matter what."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Absolutely not. These are my guys. I've been telling everybody in the media how much I love it here, and my guys is the main reason. They told me to be me. They pushed me to be me. They don't judge me for nothing. They love me for who I am, and I love it here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"The ones that are fathers, the father figures that I have on the team, they've helped me out because I'm still 27, I'm still young. I have my kids. Just seeing them being around their kids and being able to see how they interact with their kids and their families, it helps me out a lot, especially because previous teams I've been on haven't had as many fathers. I've been on a few young teams. It's just nice being able to be outside the court, spending time with my guys and having our kids around each other all the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question. Try to be simple. I think life is an incredible gift that we can't take for granted. If you've ever lost somebody close to you, that'll remind you really quick how precious life is. I've had to deal with a ton of loss in my life, just watching people that I love kind of leave this earth, and that was difficult to deal with as a young person. And then getting older and trying to deal with the perspective of being a celebrity or famous person or professional basketball player, whatever it is, an entertainer, whatever we're called, and trying to find purpose in that and why am I here. So just I think all in all, just learned how to not put so much pressure on myself, put things in perspective, and understand that I'm not alone. I'm still a young person in this world trying to figure it out, and I'm not supposed to have it all figured out. I think that's the beauty, too. Just embracing the moments that I get to share with the people that care about me unconditionally, get to know some new people in this world, go from strangers to friends. I get to know my kids, most importantly, and who I want to become for them and my wife and being a husband. Yeah, just appreciating the gifts that I've had to earn and work for and built. That's what helps me put all this in perspective, just the past few years of learning how to deal with real human emotions and not gloss over them and pretend like life is all good. That's it. Just being real with myself. Looking in the mirror and being real. If you can be honest with yourself, then the world is your canvas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, very special to watch from afar, but also as a competitor, as a hooper, to be experiencing it at this level, it's an incredible teacher for me. I use it as a moment to learn how hard it is to win, especially against a great team that's going to guard you the way that they're guarding us. The frustration is natural, just because you want to make every shot when you're in the Finals. You don't want to miss. You don't want to not play well. You give partial credit to them, but also there's a focus and a preparation you have to have. Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different. These guys on that Boston squad know my game, as well. They know it well. So they've been able to scheme for me for the past few years. So getting over this hump is something that's been on my mind for a while, watching them, just like everyone has been watching Boston the whole entire year, be the best team in the league. We obviously knew we would have our challenges, but this is what helps us grow. Going out there and competing with the best of the best, competing with Jrue and Jaylen and JT and seeing their ability to cover up some of their mistakes or trust each other to make the right plays on the defensive end has shown me what I have to continue to work on and also learn to how to think the game in a better way. I'm going against the best of the best, and this is what I've always dreamt of. Whether we win or lose, it's the growth that I look at and how I can continue to be a better leader for my teammates."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,It's been great because we're learning about each other in these moments and what we're made of and what we have to do to be great at this level.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of first-timers on this stage. I've said it over the past week or so, just it's a new space for me, too, just being with these guys and being tested at this level, being challenged at this level. My first Finals, although I was injured, I lost. You know, 2016, although we like to bring it up, was one of the toughest series you'll probably ever see in basketball in general. I don't know if those records are just going to be so easy for someone just to look at and be like, yeah, we're able to do it, too. But that belief that you can win a series and win it together. But yeah, my message to him is he's not alone in this. He's played as best as he can despite the circumstances, just injuries and stuff. He's been giving it his all. It's not all on him. Being under the microscope in this business is a lot different for me now than probably four years ago, five years ago, because I'm able to put the big picture of life in perspective and also the game in perspective. It comes easier. Then also I think the social media, sociopathic behavior. You know, your inner voice is not clear anymore when you're downloading other voices and other opinions. That can become hard. Any little thing that you give your energy to can be a distraction that doesn't positively reinforce what you're trying to accomplish. So I think we're learning that about each other right now from not only us as players but the coaching staff and everybody that's been part of this journey thus far. No one picked us to be in this position. No one anticipated us to be here. There may be a few people in this crowd right here that had an idea, but we've pretty much broken the mold of what we're capable of doing, and I think we're trending in the right direction. We have some positives going on. It obviously sucks horrendously that we're not at least competitive in this series right now three games in, but it's also about getting the experience and learning through these things and also learning more about yourself. I've taken the brunt of the responsibility because these guys in this locker room, it is their first time. So being in this position, I do feel like a lot of it is on me. A lot of my teammates would say, no, it's not just you, which I appreciate, but this is also part of my journey, and the story doesn't end here, win or loss. I'm just appreciative that we can get another chance to extend our season tomorrow and just leave it all out there. It's all about a pride thing now, and just putting our best foot forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Oh, man. Yeah. Man, I haven't even given that much thought, to be honest with you. This has been the longest season I've played in awhile. It's been six years. So I'm looking at the big picture in a way that I probably was not ready to look at in my early 20s or late 20s. The way technology is today, the way I take care of my body every day and the way I have the opportunity to learn more about my body as I get into my 30s, I'm appreciating. My mind continues to get sharper. My physical tools are obviously naturally going to deteriorate, which I can appreciate, too. So adding new skill sets or adding new nuances to my game where I can be successful at this level, especially going against a more athletic league or a faster league, and you've got me over here speaking like I'm 38 already. But at 32 right now, I just feel like the sky's the limit. I have an opportunity to be on a special team that can be one of the teams that dominates in this era. That's what I've been trying to figure out the past few years, of how to be on a great team, be in an organization where I'm trusted, and also we're able to succeed and fail together, and doing it in a way where we still have each other's backs, and no one is giving up on the dream or the goal. Our goal is still to win a championship. That's been No. 1. For me, that's why I play basketball every year is just to be able to continue to get better but also to compete for championships. If I'm not doing that at 33 or 34 or 35, then we probably can revisit this. But I think right now, I feel like we're trending in the right direction, and especially this organization led by Nico and J-Kidd and our new ownership group. They have a lot of trust in us, which I appreciate, which makes my decision making on what my future looks like a lot easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think just looking back at that first year of both of them playing together Jayson's rookie year, just remember two very extremely talented guys that right away had an impact on the team that year after losing Gordon, and those guys just taking up on the challenge. I feel like that year we started the season, we lost the first two and then we won like 15, 16 straight, and they were a big part of that. So right away, I just saw the potential there. To be at this point right now, this is what we expected. I know it doesn't always work that way. But once you get to know those two guys, the type of people that they are, their drive, they want to be great, and I just -- I saw this for them. I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I mean, since then, there's been a lot. They came in trying to figure things out, and just offensively they've grown, defensively. But more to me, it's been the leadership, being more vocal with our group, also understanding that there's more than just playing basketball. There's a whole other element, preparation, consistency. That's where I've seen their growth. That's paying big dividends for them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think it's pretty easy because what we're focusing on is on our day-to-day, and today we had a good film session before coming here. We're going to practice right after this. It's really just focusing on the work. We've continued to do this. We've been doing this all season. This is just the point of the season that we're at. We're not allowing ourselves to think ahead. We're just trying to lock in on what we have to do. The job is not done yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"So I don't really -- I guess I've heard it before. But basketball is a team sport. It's a team sport. When you are fortunate enough to play for the Boston Celtics, you quickly realize that it's more than just the team that you're representing and the things that you're trying to do. For me, being in this opportunity, I give the glory to the Lord because he's put me in this position, and for me, I know that it's more than me. We have a lot of fans. We have a lot of people. They have been waiting for this opportunity, for these moments. We've been through a lot of adversity as a team these past few years. To be at the cusp of doing this, it's something special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I would say the turnovers. To have no turnovers is always a good thing. That means that we're getting some good possessions and not giving the other team the ball.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's seeing the success of the team. I think you see how we celebrate each other. Somebody gets a big dunk or a big three, when somebody gets a big stop, that really brings energy not only to me but I feel like to everybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now. Day before Game 4, up 3-0, I feel like we celebrate each other. Even through the downs, we do our best to pick each other up. I think we've done that as a team and will continue to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, that we lock in the best we can, that we do the best to really go out there and execute the game plan and try to get stops. That really gives us the best chance to win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nerves, for sure. You feel like the close-out game is the hardest game to win. You really just want to go out there and do your best, if it's make the right plays, if it's knock down shots, execute the game plan. You feel like of everything in the season, this is the game you've got to do it. I feel like we'll have that same kind of mentality to where we try to come out relaxed, not too excited, but execute the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,It's the final game of the season.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't ask her, but we've had conversations. Just watching games or even while I watched her play soccer. I would ask her certain things about how she felt, why she played the way she played or whatever it was. I think for the most part, having just an understanding and having a partner that helps me kind of get calm in situations that can help me be in position to win on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is I don't think any of us care about it. I think we all really want to win that Larry O'Brien Trophy. Whatever accolades come with that come with it, but I think the big picture is what everybody is focused on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not even a little bit. I got two brothers in the league, so if I'm really going to be chippy or something, why wouldn't I be chippy with them? Everybody in Milwaukee, I have love for them. I love them because of what we've been through and what we accomplished as a team. We became very, very close. But no, I know that this is a business, and they feel like they did what was best for their organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's exciting. We're in a great spot, but we're really just focused on the next game and taking it day by day. The job is not done yet, so still a lot of work to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's important. It's really important. You've got to stay disciplined, got to stay in your routines, got to be good in practice. Then all that together leads into the game and execution. We're just trying to be as disciplined and as consistent as possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I mean, Al is just a true professional. He's one of the best teammates I've ever had. He's seen a lot in this league. He's a guy you can lean on for advice. He's seen everything you can see. But really want to get this one for him. It's like the one thing that he just hasn't been able to get yet in his career, and it'll be pretty special if we can do it for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he's always poking his head in. I'd say he's pretty in tune with what's going on. He's at every practice. I'm sure he's talking to the coaches, giving advice every now and then. He's just a good guy to have around. He provides good advice, and obviously another guy who's been through a lot and seen a lot of things in this league. It's good to have him around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he gave me a chance in this league. I was undrafted. I didn't really know what was going to come on draft night, and he called me and gave me a shot with a two-way, and I just tried to make the most of it. Obviously I got converted up to the big leagues. It's hard to thank him enough for giving me a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's good. I think he has a unique relationship with everybody. I think he's good at finding one or two things to talk about with each guy on a daily basis that's just to keep the humanity in this professional world. He's a great human. He really truly cares about you as a person first more so than as a player, which is awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he deserves a lot of credit for it. He constantly keeps us in check, tries to keep us right where we need to be, not too high, not too low, but right in the sweet spot. He's done a great job of that this year. Obviously we have a great lead in this series, but like I said before, the job is not done, and he's definitely kept us in check knowing that we still have a lot to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,My dad is here. It was great to have him here supporting. It's great.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It feels fine. You've got to be able to express your feelings. It's amazing just to be here, be a part of something that a lot of guys never really been able to play in. Just embracing it and try and do the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think it's difficult playing against everybody in general. But specifically Boston, 1 through 5, they all can guard. Even when you're trying to find weaknesses in their defense, they always come back or they always have a back line of defense that helped that guy out. They don't really do a great job of just playing individual defense. They do a great job playing team defense, which goes a long way and which everybody can see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think the biggest adjustment will be being able to build on that fourth quarter that we had yesterday. Played desperate, played well. Everybody was defending, keeping their man in front of them, contesting every shot, and rebounding, making sure they didn't get any offensive rebounds. If we can build off on that moving forward, I think we give ourselves a great opportunity."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I mean, Al has been the same way since we've been in Atlanta. Always solid. Always solid, never doing too much, never getting out of sync, keeping everybody together, an anchor on defense, talking on defense, which gives the guards amazing confidence to guard their man, knowing that he's in that back line. Just him being able to make it this far and be in this position, very, very happy to see him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It's part of their defense. Like I said, it's not an individual defense, it's a team defense, and they take pride in it. They're one of the best at it, if not the best at it. It's not really him on an island picking up Luka and Ky. He has a really solid back line behind him making sure he's confident out there in front of those guys. Yeah, that's probably the reason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,It was good. I think it's important to be able to look at what we didn't do right and learn from that and just make sure we're ready.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I just think there's been certain things that we've done continuously in games that we probably should have made adjustments on. But overall we always watch film and it's always an open discussion. And I think that's what's cool with Coach, is he sees both sides of us and is able to talk it out with the players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"When you're in the game, I'm not really studying every single foul he commits. At the end of the day it's --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"It's unfortunate. It's a hard position to be put into. But at the end of the day, he's doing it for a reason, and it's because he wants to win the game. He's a competitive guy, so I'm not holding my head a certain way. I know he wants to win, and he's a very competitive leader, and he's the leader of our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, it's obviously challenging. The refs are -- as frustrating as they can be sometimes, they're also the same as us, they have emotions, they change the way -- the same way players get frustrated, they can get frustrated. But obviously I think it can change the game a little bit, but I think that's what's helped our team is when we've been at our best, we don't let it hurt us. We kind of use it, use that energy and shift it to us. We kind of let certain things change the way the game goes. It can be challenging for players for sure, but I really back our group, and we have a group of guys that I know I'll go to battle with all the time. No matter what the energy is, I always feel like we can always turn it around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,Leave it all out on the floor. That's what we need to do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they're a big three-point team. That's one of their biggest focuses. They're a great shooting team. I mean, it's just part of the game, and it's like, you're saying from like a defensive point of view --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points. I think our team, we've done great defensively, and I think we do have a great defensive team. Obviously they've hit some tough shots, but overall I think we have played good defense. But going into the game, it's hard to say limit them to a certain number, but obviously we want to limit them to under whatever their averages were. And obviously we know they're a big three-point team, and just like us, we're a big corner three-point team, and they've done a good job of taking that away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Mindset going into Game 4 is win. Feelings right now is to be better than the last.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was tough because we fought our way back, so we fought so hard to get all the way back. The guys that were out there on the floor, they gave it all they got. A lot of guys that came back to the locker room after the game was exhausted. Just seeing how hard they fought, it was just tough to see how the outcome was for it. But it's motivation going into the next game, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmmm... I would say it's a little bit of both. But I would say we stay motivated and we just focus on the next game at hand, the most important game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just shows how desperate we were playing. It was something that I saw when it came to just like guys coming into the timeout. It was just a lot of motivation. Everybody was pulling each other in, trying to stay encouraged. Didn't matter what was going on, didn't matter how the fans were. It didn't matter what was going on just like on the outside, everything on the inside is what was all falling into place together, in my opinion. From everything that I seen, everybody was lifting each other up. D Live, he was one of the most vocal guys out there with Kyrie. Whenever Luka went down after his sixth foul, everybody pulled together, just tried to make one final push. The vibe around the team was just leave it all out there on the floor. Whatever happens in the end happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,We just have to find ways to just implement that 20-2 run to just like our game plan in general from start to finish. I can't really just pinpoint on why it doesn't happen at the beginning of the games. For sure it's an adjustment that we can make to be able to come out and do it in the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,It's real encouraging. We want to be able to just survive and advance. It's the last series of the season. Don't nobody want to ever be in this position. But we just have to really just take our time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, yeah, for sure. We always want to help the main two guys when it comes to just scoring. Defensively I feel like we're doing our job. It just comes all down to just defense wins games. We just have to, like I said, just stay motivated when it comes to certain parts of the game. Not trying to force everything, just kind of like letting the game come to us in certain areas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, first, I think I just look at how long the guys have been in the paint, the low man. If it's time -- if it's like two seconds, he's going to go out. I think that's the moment to attack. Then I just try to read the game. If he comes, there's going to be a lob open to the corner. If he doesn't, I just try to take the layup."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, yeah. At some point, yeah. I just really want to win. Sometimes I don't show it the right way, but at the end of the day, I really want to win. I've got to do a better job showing it a different way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Go back to playing fun. We talk about how we come back from 20 points in the fourth quarter in the Finals. We were having fun. We were defending. We were running. Our pace was great. Just taking good shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just got to go away, because at the end of the day refs are going to have the last word. So just got to go away from that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I didn't really study the first Finals of some people. Obviously, they were great players. Obviously, there's the story of MJ against Detroit. That was a big thing. I think he just learned from it. It's a great experience. You've got to go through lows first to go on top. I think that's great experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just like we did before. I always talk in the regular season, there was a time we were at our very low. I think we lost five, six in a row, and from there we just went up. I think we went 17-2 to get in the Playoffs. I know that's the regular season, but it was the kind of point we all came together, and the chemistry from there went to the top. We've just got to believe. We talk about it in the locker room. I know we can do it, and we're going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they have great players. Basically, all five players that are on the floor, they can really score. They can shoot. Our strategy was just trying to make them drive more and then be on the wheel, on the rotations. I think I have to do a better job on that, just keeping in front."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Oh, definitely, a lot of holes, I think, still. I'm 25. I've got a lot of things to learn. This is my first NBA Finals, so I'm going to learn from it, for sure. But we're not in the offseason yet. They've still got to win one more game. Like I said, we're going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just keeping the team together. Like I said, we have great guys. We all know what we came here to do. Obviously, we're going against the best team in the NBA, but we're going to believe. It's a first for us, but we're going to believe, and that's our motivation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, last year, just falling short on your home floor, it definitely hurt. It was embarrassing, in my opinion. I felt like the team was relying on me. JT got hurt in Game 7 and I dropped the ball. To me, it was embarrassing. It drove me all summer, drove me crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I've never been a complainer to the refs. I don't think I've ever had a history -- I don't even know most of the refs by name. I do think having a relationship and talking to them to know what you're kind of seeing can have a benefit. But at this point, I think it's a distraction. You go out there and you play the game, and you take it out of the referees' hands."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Joe has been great. Just being in this position last year, just being in the interim role was tough. Even though we weren't making any excuses, but him inheriting that position, it was a little bit more of uncertainty about what we were doing going forward. It wasn't necessarily his staff. Now I feel like he's gotten his feet under him a little bit more, even the start of this year. He's been excellent. He's been organized. He seems like he's been a lot more comfortable, and it's showed in our team. Joe's mentality is fantastic. Even today, one of my favorite quotes he said today, he was like, there's no such thing as a foul in a war. Either you survive or you don't. Just that resonates with me because I like stuff like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's really just all mentality, mentally just your will, your focus, your perseverance, your ability to overcome self. I think that's what I worked on the most. In moments of embarrassment, in moments of coming up short, falling short is where the most growth takes place. Last year to end the season the way we did, I really attacked the summer."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. You spend so much time and you go through so many things, the ups, the downs, the highs and the lows, and it creates that. Those memories are memories that we're going to forever have together. So those are things that you're always going to carry with you. To be able to be in this moment, to potentially seal our first championship, I think that's awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Damn, that's a good question. My love for the game has definitely changed and evolved. There's been ups and downs, for sure. But one thing that I've always loved is the ability to have a platform and to be able to be a role model for others. There's younger kids watching, maybe watching this interview right now, that maybe aspire to get to the Finals or the NBA or to just be the best versions of themselves. It's going to be a journey. Just know when those moments of adversity come, just never let nothing break your spirit, because I didn't, and I won't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that top to bottom, we trust everybody, and we just compete at a high level. Obviously they are great players, and it's a challenge but just consistently being in the right position and just competing. Jrue is literally everywhere. It's unreal. I don't know how he does it. Try to learn as much as I can from him, and he's just -- just when you think you've got an opening, like he's just -- he's unreal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a guy that just wants to learn. Some of the drills he does is just a little unconventional, I think, but like just wants to learn and wants to grow. And then every year he's been in the league, he's gotten so much better. That's just a credit to his mindset and the work he puts in. So being his teammate has been a lot of fun. I've learned so much from him, and he just continues to push me and the rest of us to continue to improve and want to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, Joe is consistent the whole time. I mean, he's probably so happy that it happened like that so he can just continue to tell us that laughter. But he just stays consistent. He just makes the right calls, and we just trust him completely. So, yeah, it seemed pretty true today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's a sicko, so probably. Laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Sam has been doing it all year. He gets attacked nearly every time he checks into the game, and we've just got a lot of faith and confidence in him. He just does what he needs to do. But big shout out to X. To not be in the rotation but to stay locked in and he gives us big-time minutes, plus nine, and he just does a little bit of everything out there. Then he guarded his ass off and hit a big shot and rebounds, and he just did a little bit of everything for us. Credit to him. Great, great teammate, great guy, and he was big for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, obviously the strength of this team is the team. But we understand that JB and JT, they are our guys, and they are going to make big plays and they are going to make the right play. I think that's the most important part is just we trust them to make the right play every time down the court, and they are facing literally every coverage known to man. They just make the right play no matter what time is on the clock, and we just trust them so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think experience always helps. We have a lot of guys that have been in close games and big games, and so I just don't think we panic probably as much as we have in the past. We just try to stay calm and do what we need to do. I mean, who knows if we would have lost these games in the past, but we just know we've got so many different ways to win games and trust that we can find the answer and just do whatever it takes to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"It's big time. He just stays right here, competes on the defensive end like always. And offensively he can take nine shots, he can take one shot. Like he doesn't care. And just does whatever it takes for us to win. So just having him on the team is just a big blessing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think just we had some turnovers, which allowed them to get out in transition. And just a couple of things that we've been doing really well, we kind of just let go of the rope for however many minutes that was. It seemed like, what, two minutes, they cut it to two, three or something. It happened quick, and we just settled back down. Understand it's a game of runs, and we just trust what we do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Obviously the closer you are to winning that's his go-to. That was obviously said. But just understand that we need to play better. The close-out games are never easy, and close-out games in the Finals is probably ten-times of that. So learn a lot from what we did well, what we need to do and just understand we're going to have to play even better for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Big-time. Big-time shots. Just a guy that he wanted the ball and was able to get to his spot and rise up and knock it down. He makes tough shots, and he's just a special player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Demanded, whoa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think Joe is a basketball genius. So whatever he says, I'm going to try to just do it to my highest capabilities. I mean, we just try to make the right basketball play every time down the court, whether that's a three, but just trying to have the right spacing and just make the right basketball play. It's not like we need to take however many threes. I think we just can win in so many different ways, and with our spacing and guys that can shoot on the court, we can just do so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Just you know showing the emotions of the game. Two guys that was excited, tired, that you know, after the game, we just -- we're not necessarily saying like one more or anything like that. We are just saying, however long it takes. Nobody is relaxed. Nobody is satisfied. Just at that moment, you know, just told him I was proud of him and he said the same thing that we've got to keep fighting. We can't relax. And that was basically the conversation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Honestly, not too difficult from the standpoint of last year we were down 0-3 in the Conference Finals, and we really felt like we were going to come back. We almost did. You know, we were a sprained ankle away from having like a real shot. So, you know, we are not relaxing or anything like that. You know, not even focusing on winning or Friday or whatever. However long it takes, that's our motto. However long it takes, that's what it's going to take, and nobody is not trying to relax at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That's a great question. I would say that life is about roller coasters, right. The game of basketball and life and whatever your occupation is, right, we all go through ups and downs. In the toughest moments, that's when your true character comes out and essentially being the same person all the time, that's what I try to do, in the best of times and in the worst of times. That's what I'm going to try to instill in him. You've got to be the same person. You've got to be a stand-up guy through thick and thin."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, they came out swinging. That was to be expected. They were at home, and their crowd was behind them. This is obviously a big game. So we expected their first punch. You know, it's just in that moment that Jrue kind of brought us together and just clapped his hands like, Yo, we got to wake up, we got to lock in. We got to get some stops. Because at that point, they had like 25 points. In the last five, six minutes, we held them to like five or six points. But to start the quarter, we weren't getting any stops. You know, we are not going to win a game like that. We just have to reset and lock back in at that moment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Not really trying to look too much into it. The game of basketball is about runs, and this is at the highest level. You know, it's the best team in the West at this point. They are going to make shots. They are going to go on a run, and it's just all about how do you respond. You know, we talk about it all the time. 20-point leads, none that have is ever safe. It's never time to relax. You never want to give up a 20-point lead. Obviously we wish we would have got some better shots, took care of the ball. But things happen. It's never going to go how you expect it, and we talk about that all the time. But if you want to be a champion, you have to be resilient in those moments, and we showed that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Joe does a great job of showing us clips and things from different sports, right. He's a big UFC fan. And you know, showing us fights of people that -- I don't know like the terminology of UFC, but put them in a chokehold and s--- like they about to tap out. You just see the guy or the woman who is winning relaxing because they feel like they are about to win, and then, you know, you give the other person life. Just trying to translate that to the game of basketball that, you know, the closer you are to winning, the closer they are to surviving. Basically just trying to remind us in the group that we've still got a long way to go. We still have to play the right way. We've still got to win. They are not going to quit, and we should expect the best from them from here on out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"You just alluded to it that we've been in that situation. We've been in a close game where we were up, and we almost went up 3-1, and then they tied it. And experience is the best teacher. We learned from our mistakes. We learned from a team at the time that was better than us, that had been there and been over that hump and mentally tougher at the time. We've grown from that, we really have. It was on display tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I've got to watch the film, but that was excellent basketball we played to start the third, especially on the offensive end. I don't know how many possessions in a row that we got a great shot. We made most of them. We might have missed a few. But the way that we started the third quarter was incredible. You know, everybody else on that court, the mindset we came out to start the third in our execution, we did a hell of a job in the start of the third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't know if it's at cut and dry as we need to shoot a lot of threes, but with the group that we have and playing to our strengths, being able to beat guys off the dribble, and the luxury that we have is, you know, with our starting five, whether it's KP or Al, everybody can space the floor and shoot. So it just puts their 5-man in a tough position. 5-men are known to usually help at the rim. But if we have guys that can attack you off the dribble and get all the way to the rim, you want to help. But we've got 40 percent three-point shooters all around the paint. So it's just all about making the right reads. We're never like, we need to shoot 40 threes a night. But if we play to our strength and space how we're supposed to, it just finds the right person, and we don't turn down any great shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, it's tough to lose him. Obviously praying for Karen, Jonnie, Ryan, the rest of their family. My junior year in college, wasn't living up to anyone's standards. I got a call. It's Jerry. A lot of expletives, but he basically told me I was an F-up and had the opportunity to be great at something. Just let me have it for like 10, 15 minutes. I thought it was one of the most impactful phone calls that I had really in my life. Stayed at his house once and overslept for UCLA open gym. Went down for breakfast and got another ass chewing because I wasn't being competitive enough. The thing I remember about him is he had a tough way of showing that he loved you, but he was super, super competitive and he really, really cared about you. He showed it in a way that kind of spoke to my language. He'll be missed and praying for the family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, just day to day. Just the medical team and the staff just decided that it wasn't what's best for him to go tonight. Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, obviously you saw in the first two games his rim protection, his ability to space the floor. But I think the thing that prepared us this year is our depth. It just looks different. The guys ready to step in can do different things and have a positive impact, which they've done. So we just have to rely on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, it's tough. I've appreciated just his approach. Throughout the whole Playoffs, like I said, he's never missed any meeting, he's always been out there, done everything he can to play. Sometimes it's an unfortunate situation. It's nothing that he can do. Definitely feel for him, but appreciate kind of where he's at. I trust that he'll do everything he can to get ready for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"KP, you're not playing. He didn't look right. That was it. I wasn't involved in it. Like you said, it was out of his hands, up to the medical team. They watched him kind of go through some testing and they said it didn't feel right, so you're not playing. Get ready for tomorrow and hopefully the next day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"A little bit everywhere. When you're not that good, they just throw you around in a bunch of different places to see where you stick."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"A lot of stuff. I think just the beauty of the game, the flow of the game. I think it's different. Soccer is much different than the game of basketball. A basketball star is only defined by scoring. Soccer, you really have to pay attention to the game to recognize the impact each individual player is doing, because points are at a premium. Each guy in the right position has a direct impact on the guy in the next position. So greatness, you have to pay attention and look for it, whereas in basketball you can look at a stat sheet and say, oh, it must've been this guy that have played really well. So really the depths to which you have to go to understand the greatness and the complexity, the beauty and the connectivity that goes into playing the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I wasn't out there. I have no idea.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It's the same steady messaging. Also you want to give them the best preparation you can as far as what the sub pattern might be and what the ifthen scenarios will be. So you go over a couple of those with them, but for the most part it's the work those guys have been doing with them leading up to this point and conversations with their individual coaches, which have gone very well. I just trust the work they put in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the questions have allowed me to fight that. I don't think I've gone out of my way to do it. You guys have asked really good questions based on that. I've been able to take the question you guys ask and give my perspective on it. I think at the end of the day, it's about our team and it's about putting the guys in the best possible position to succeed and have an understanding that our guys are going out there and doing everything they can as a team, and why that's so important to long-term success. I think that's what we're trying to achieve as an organization. It doesn't happen unless the players decide to do it, and they're doing it. You can't let that go unnoticed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Like if you've ever been in a fight with someone and you think you're about to beat 'em, you usually get sucker punched. The closer you are to beating them up, the closer you are to losing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Closer you think you're going to submit someone, is usually when you get submitted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"There's a lot of them. Usually every single fight. I think it was UFC 302, guy gets hits in the nuts, complains to the ref, complains to the referee, gets distracted, he gets choked out the next round. He lost his focus. You see Alex Pereira, gets hits in the nuts, looks at the referee, knocks the guy out five seconds later. So it's the approach to what happens to you and how you handle it. But the closer you think you are to beating someone is the closer you are to getting your ass kicked. Tonight I expect the best out of Dallas, and we got to get ready for a fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, you were going to expect a run from them because they had a 19-point quarter. And just by the type of shots they take alone, you knew they were going to make some kind of run. Some of those came at the expense of our offense. I thought we missed a couple reads that changed coverages and they changed matchups on like three or four straight possessions and we missed the read to get the right shot. So I would say probably 60 percent of the shots that we took in that stretch we have to get better, and 40 percent I was okay with. We just missed them. Our one-shot defense and our ability to get back to the game plan, they put a ton of pressure on your defensive game plan throughout, and you've just got to stick with the discipline of it. So we were able to do that and make plays down the stretch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Nothing. Our first half points per shot was 1.23. So I thought we getting really good looks. They just weren't falling. You just have to stick with it over the course of the entire game. I thought in the third quarter, we found the right spacing and frequency, and we made the right reads six times and that got us those shots and they were able to fall. That's where the second stretch of that fourth quarter, we missed some of those reads, and they were able to come back into the game. Those guys' ability to know that what shots they were taking, and continue to take the right ones over and over again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"He played in the Western Conference for three or four years, and so he's played against the Mavs. And so he's had that experience. Memphis has used a similar game plan, so he was used to that. I thought with that comfort level of playing against those guys for so long, he was going to be able to execute the things that we needed to execute. And so I thought he did a great job in our switching and did a great job in our screening, getting into our spacing. And that's what we talk about with those guys, is regardless of who is in, who is out, I trust the next man up because of the work they put in and the staff that prepares them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, we got asked that question a lot because it was new. Anytime you're developing a new philosophy or a new style, it just takes time for understanding and execution. So credit to the guys where we decided how we are going to play, and we fight to do that. You know, but also just being flexible in that. So we don't want to just settle for those. I think our guys have done a good job fighting for the right shot based on what the defense was giving us. We were able to get some of those in the third quarter. So I think it says a lot about them. The guys understand the game. They understand why we do what we do, and they work to execute it as best as they can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I would say both teams have a lot of talent. So I think you have to have talent to get to this spot. That's a given if you want to make it this far. But our guys have a great basketball IQ and have a great understanding of are we playing the right way, taking the right shots and giving up the right shot. They know exactly when we are not doing that. So they have an innate ability to control the runs of the game with the philosophy that we have and execute the things. And so it's just constant building awareness, are we getting the right shots, are we giving up the right shots and are we winning the transitions. The guys do a great job of working towards understanding that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just what we talked about. Having an understanding of like we know teams are going to make runs can we manage those. And we know why we make runs, and we know why other teams make a run on us. So you just have to constantly problem solve throughout the game. You have to ask yourself why every single possession, why did that happen? Why did this happen? Was this what we talked about? Was it not? And the guys, they fight for that because of their basketball IThey spend a lot of time understanding that. And that's part of the game. They got out to a big lead, and I forgot what we were down, 13? So that's just part of the game. But it's understanding why. Why are we down 13? Is it effort? Is it execution? Is it things we can control? And once we answer those questions, we can move on to the next phase of the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, how can I explain Jaylen? The guy just has a growth mindset. He just wants to get better. He yearns to get better. He's not afraid to face his weaknesses on the court. So when you have that type of mindset, you're just going to be able to take on every situation that the game brings you. He puts himself in every single situation that he sees in a game. He uses six, seven, eight coaches a day, and every situation on both ends of the floor, he puts himself in that. And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't think he gets worn down. He looks pretty fresh out there. I think we could do a better be job of being intentional in the offense with the spacing at times, but I don't see him getting tired at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"We were trying to play fast, create advantages and create indecision. But we didn't create any indecision. When you miss the first read, it's not a lack of execution from the guys. It's not a lack of like trying to execute. It's if you miss the first read and you miss the first window, it's really hard to get that window back against a team. And so, you know, that's what we were able to do in the third quarter. We found the first read, bang, right there, and we got it like six, seven, eight times in a row. If you miss that first one, it's a nightmare to get a second and third one, and that's when you end up taking a couple shots you don't want to take. It wasn't because they weren't trying to. We just missed it. They do a good job of changing up matchups and changing spacing and fluctuating it. So there's about eight possessions where we will definitely watch. But we have to do a better job of seeing the first read and when we don't, we have to find the second one faster."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just stick to the things that we've been doing. I mean, have an understanding. We were down 13. I expected that. We were down one at the half, and I expected that. You have to expect the expected. You've got to understand we are just as vulnerable if not more vulnerable than they are. And we have to play that way. So as long as we have that mindset, and when you understand that you're vulnerable and your back's against the wall, you've got to fight. And so that's the mindset that we have to have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Again, it's all about taking the right shots. It's all about taking what the defense gives you. They are playing a unique defense against us because they are one of the best teams in the league at protecting the rim, and they have two great rim protectors. So if you try to become stubborn, you put yourself in a disadvantaged situation at the other end of the floor. Our defense starts with our offense. And so if we don't take the right shot, we can't guard them. And our team has the discipline to fight for the spacing and to fight to take the right shot, whatever that shot may be. Derrick has a green light to shoot the shots because his skill set is taking the shots that make sense. He can get into the paint and shoot the two-foot floater off there, he can shoot off the dribble threes, and he can shoot catch-and-shoot threes. I love the fact that he continues to play. His confidence never wavers based on the shots he takes, and you can always count on him to make the big ones."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We just got to make history. We got to go out there and we just got to play like our lives on the line. We got to make sure we're not giving up corner threes. The game plan is allowing them to get to the rim, allow them to take pull-up twos. So we're going to keep learning to do that, but we got to be able to rotate well, talk, communicate, know where the pass is going to go, know where we need to be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We all know what it takes. We all know we got to put everything in our minds, our body and our soul into this game. We're watching film, we're talking to one another, we're trying to figure out what we need to do. They're a great team, so you got to give them that. They know how to score. They've been doing this for a long time. We just got to be able to step up, learn and be able to adapt."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It really comes down to us just taking our foot off the gas. There were times in the game we allowed them to be comfortable, allowed them to walk into threes. That's what they're going to do. They're going to make the shots that they get, we're going to give them. We just can't take our foot off the gas. There were times in I'd say the third quarter and end of the second that we just allowed them to go on runs. We allowed them to be comfortable. We can't allow that to happen. We have to be up in their grill the entire game, and not let our foot off the gas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Next-man-up mentality. No matter if I foul out, Luka or Ky. It's the next-man-up mentality. No matter who is on the floor, what's going on in the game, we're all putting our heart and soul into trying to win. I feel like we did an amazing job throughout the whole game. Even when we slipped up, we were staying together, staying positive, doing whatever we could to try to win. We just got to be able to take care of the little things. The little details is what is going to cost us the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I didn't think it was a foul. I don't think any of us did. Just you can't take back what the refs call. You can't take back that moment. So seeing him foul out, he putting his trust in us, his teammates, as I would do if I fouled out. Just because he fouls out doesn't mean we're all going to look down and be boo-hoo, we lost. We're going to keep our foot on the gas. We were trying to do whatever we could to try to stay in the game and win. We come up short, but we're going to learn from our mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Us as bigs, we were trying to make more of an impact than we have the past two games. Trying to duck in, be all over the glass, no matter if it's defensive or offensive, try to go on a run. They were trying to pass off Porzingis' man a lot. Even with that, we were trying to put Al Horford in it, any other elephants, and try to get the mismatches, get the space and get the shots that we like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"He came out, he was the head of the snake. I feel like he was leading us, making sure we had energy, making sure we were talking to each other, staying positive and then setting each other up. He was talking to us, saying what he needs from us, what we need from him. He's been a great leader. He had a great game today. I know he's going to have another one on Friday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"He's a great defender. He's been in the league for a while. He understands the game. He understands the schemes, what they're trying to do, what we're trying to do. There were a couple times he got on the ball, he was moving his puppies. Got to tip your hat to that. Just because that happens -- just because you're adding a new person in doesn't mean anything. We were just trying to do what we do. Get out in pace, pass the ball, throw it ahead, get ahead, get to the rim. If not, get corner threes and move the ball around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,That's a good question. There's a lot of them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the adjustment is no different than the Indiana series. They didn't have him. They're used to not having him. The adjustment with Horford or Tillman, someone that they can go to. I think there's not a big adjustment. They just came out of a series without KP. We look for them to continue. Maybe somebody's minutes goes up. For us, understanding what KP does at the rim with the shot blocking or changing shots. So we have to be aggressive when we take the ball and understand their smalls are pretty good at blocking shots, too. We have to account for who is at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It was just brought to my attention. I didn't even know. Talking to Mike and Doris from ABC, today was Game 6. Just to understand time flies by. But it was a surreal moment to be able to win the championship. To do it with that team, with Dirk being our leader, Jason Terry. They were asking, What did you think when the horn went off? I was like, We wanted to keep playing, but there was no one else to play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think we're comfortable with P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with Maxi at the five. Boston has done a great job in the sense of taking the vertical game away and living with the layup. When you look at our quarterbacks, Ky and Luka, getting to the rim, we have to take that and at some point, if we can make enough to see if they can make that change. If they don't, we can look at Maxi or P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with that. We've done that during the season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I did not, unfortunately."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"That's a great question. Everybody. The game of basketball is about communication. For our guys, that's one of the things, as much as communicate, the next step is listen and be able to process what's being said. For us as a group, we've been a little bit slower with that. Hopefully we've made that adjustment and can be better with that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think talking about the last game, we put ourselves in a position on the road to win. That's all you can ask for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I haven't talked to Dirk here in the last week. He has FIBA obligations. He has tennis lessons and everything else smiling. He has more important things. We'll talk when we're at home and he's here hopefully for Game 3 or 4, just to get some advice of what he sees here as we go forward. But I haven't talked to him since the Minnesota series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's I think what we talked about after the game, one possession at a time. We'll watch film tomorrow and get ready for Friday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we were trying to find someone to come off the bench and give us a spark. It doesn't always have to be someone making a shot. I thought the guys that played tonight helped us get the lead or get back into the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"They called a foul. I was stuck. I had to challenge it, so ... Had to challenge because it was a close call. But the referee called it a foul. Got to move on, move forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We missed some layups. We had some good looks. We missed some layups, some open threes. Again, we miss a three, Ky misses a pullup that we would take every time. It's a one-possession game. Unfortunately, we could just not get over the hump tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he's definitely got a bull's-eye on his chest. He's got to be able to guard and understand that we're there to protect him and help him if he does get beat. Again, he's carrying a load offensively. They are putting him in every pick-and-roll and iso. He's got to be able to play the game where he can rest on offense and let others carry the load."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I don't know if it was the Celtics. I think we just got -- we missed some bunnies tonight. Understanding that that's just part of the game, I think with fatigue, mentally and physically. We just missed some layups that we haven't missed here in the Playoffs. Give them credit they make it tough. They will wear on you as the game goes on. We got off to a good start. But I didn't see where they affected us in the sense of we missed some layups. That's just the game of basketball. It happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think for us, this is a quick turn, so we don't have time to, like, go to the park or anything. We got to figure out how to score the ball, take care of the ball. Again, Brown and Tatum, when you give up 60 points to those guys, we don't have time to go clear our minds. We've got to do better. That's for everybody who's playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it looked -- looks can be deceiving."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think when you look at experience, we're all learning what it means to be on this stage and going through it. There's a lot of young players on our side who have never done this before. Just understand, we'll talk about that, that this experience that we're going through is a healthy thing. It's not a bad thing. We're down 3-0. We felt like Game 2 and Game 3 were better for us. That's the way we have to play. Then offensively we just got to get some other people to step up and make some shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,End of the fourth? I called a couple timeouts.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,That's tough. Why you guys laughing? I asked what timeout was it. I called a couple timeouts. You got to do better.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Thank you. We missed the three and we missed Ky's pullup. It's a one-possession game. We exerted lot of energy on the defensive end and the offensive end, so that's why we called a timeout. That's for clarify that. Way to step up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, they're a good team. They're going to make adjustments. They know how much of our offense over the Playoff run has been predicated on getting easy looks for our bigs. They've been taking it away, putting guards on the bigs, not really helping off of them. A lot of one-on-one defense. It's about us finishing and hopefully that creates some space where we can throw a lob."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I don't think I really had a choice. It was unfortunate that the foul was called. Luka picked up his fifth and sixth in a matter of a three-minute or two-minute span. It's tough. We still had to figure out a way to win the basketball game. We put our best foot forward, especially being down 21. We easily could have packed up and folded. But we didn't give up. We kept playing. The guys that were out there, we kept competing. Felt like we gave ourselves a chance to win down the stretch. They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today. But when you're going against a good juggernaut offensive team like the Boston Celtics, they're going to make you pay for mistakes. You got to give them credit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, but it was a quick look. I mean, we're in the NBA Finals. I'm not really thinking I've got to tell my guys we still have a chance to win the game, we're only down by three points. But yeah, I think probably in that stretch, I definitely could have done a better job of just settling them for what's coming. Jrue was picking me up full court. They knew they were going to pressure me to get the ball out of my hands. I just tried to make the right plays, make sure guys were in the right spots, have them understand that we still have a chance to win this basketball game. That was all I was thinking. Just even before Luka fouled out, just the way we started off the fourth quarter, giving up those two baskets where they went up 21. Again, we could have folded but we kept playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, I just really think about going home. This is a metaphor here. Just be ready smiling. Just go home, get the ammo ready, get the bazooka, the 50 cal ready. Get everything ready, because when we come into Game 4, we know we got to shoot our shots and we got to do it with an aggression. Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability. We just got to stay positive. For me personally, again, I'm going home, dusting off the tools and just getting ready for a tough Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time a team has tried to target Luka on the defensive end. So for us, we're just trying to put a great shell defense around not only him, but the rest of the team. It's going to be a great defensive challenge for anybody to guard Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. You have other guys that are playing roles that are pretty much great team roles they fulfilled. Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, they're great offensive players too, but when you have those guys on the backside making decisions, playing high IQ, they're going to make you pay for your mistakes. Then you got you Derrick White catching the ball by his waist or above his head and still shooting the threes and making timely threes. Again, you got to give them credit. Still, we have a belief that we can win one game at a time and take this series a little bit further."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question. I think when you see us out there, there are a lot of shots at the rim that are contested by one person or two people. I think at this point it's more of a pride thing for us to go and finish."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step. I definitely wasn't there emotionally or mature-wise. He definitely deserves his flowers. He rallied us tonight. Came to the bench and just told us to keep believing. When you have one of the youngest team on the team, if not the youngest guy on the team speaking like that, one of two choices. We can either follow his lead and continue to ride his energy, or we fold up. I think that we made the former choice, and we kept playing and kept competing. Just wasn't enough. But I got to give a big shut out to D Live for keeping us at bay and keeping us at peace. That was special. That was special. Those are moments that you remember forever and you carry on as a team that can help you down the line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"We just got to convert. I feel like we're getting a lot of shots that we like. When you have Luka going against Payton Pritchard or D White in the post, somebody else in the post, we feel really good about it. Now isn't the time to hold our head on not converting shots that we normally have made a majority of this playoff run. We just got to keep attacking. Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"You just got to let it breathe a little bit. Let the human emotions come out. Just give him a hug. That's it, man. It's easy to point the finger at just him, say, you could be better. That's easy to say. I think he knows that. But, yeah, it's reiterating that I have his back, we all have his back. It's a tough game. It was a tough call. We could have probably done a little bit something different on his fifth foul just to give us a little bit more of a grace period to set our defense and get him on a matchup. But hindsight is 2020. We have to wash our hands of this and get ready for Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It felt great. It felt like we played really good basketball. Our defense was really good. Obviously, to withstand that run there in the fourth, that was huge. I felt like we stayed with it. We took their hit and we were able to find a way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we needed to stay poised. We feel like we have been in these positions before and weve learned in the past from it, and I feel like we handled it well. D-White made a big three there late. JB and JT made some big plays, and Jrue defensively was all over the place. We just find a way to get it done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,Just continuing to play. Understanding that Kyrie was going to be more aggressive and we had to do a good job guarding him.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Derrick is special. Derrick is such a special player. Hes a winner. He wants to be in these positions and these moments. Its just unbelievable how he continues to find way to impact the game. Offense, defense, whatever it is, hes doing something to impact winning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Obviously, I was probably going to play some more. Then we needed somebody from the bench to come in and give us minutes, and Xavier was amazing tonight. His energy, defensively he held his own, time and time again. He was just ready for the moment. Its not easy being in that position. He came in and he knocks down that big three as well. But defensively he was special. Im just proud of him because he didnt get an opportunity the first two games, obviously, and he has stayed with it, really took advantage of it. These are the type of games people remember forever, the type of impact he had."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It was a great win. You saw how Dallas fought back and I feel like we knew that they would always fight. But I think toward the end of the game you saw our best players in JT and JB just take over the game, make big plays, get big stops and we got the win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I feel like we have been doing it all year. Weve been battle tested. Weve been in situations like this before, up 20, down 15 or whatever it is. Really just stayed together and stayed composed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Cant get too high. There is still one more left. Weve seen crazier things happen. Just get the win. Whatever it takes, however long it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,We feel for him. We know that he wants to be out there fighting with us and we want him out there with us. But weve always had the next-man-up mentality and to go out there and win it for him and win it for our team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"It's okay. Every time they draw it, basically call a foul. I try to be better. So got to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, yeah, we had a good chance. We were close. Just didn't get it. I wish I was out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, I don't know. We couldn't play physical. I don't know. I don't want to say nothing. You know, six fouls in the NBA Finals, basically I'm like this motions with palms out. C'mon, man. Better than that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think we should have just kept playing with the same energy, keep the same people in. We were rolling down there. But then they came back. At some point we were down 21, too, in the fourth quarter and we came back. We're still going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Not really. Never happened to me, I remember."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just playing with pace. We played good defense and we played with pace, just driving, kicking. That's how we got back into the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think we got to figure out some things. We played three times against them now, so we're getting to know them. But I think being down 21 in the third game and then coming back was a really positive thing for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Like I said, it's not over till it's over. We just got to believe. Like I always say, it's first to four. We're going to stay together. We lose together, we win together. So we got to stay together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't see what he said. I don't know. But he was a legend. We all going to miss him. He's the logo, so... He was an amazing player. I wasn't born yet, but I saw some highlights. He was an amazing player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think I've made that play from beginning of the season or before the season even started. I told myself that I wanted to just maximize my defensive potential, and I wanted to make First Team All-Defense going into the season. I mean, that didn't happen, but to be able to be in these moments and show your defensive versatility, picking guys up, guarding guys in the post, guarding contested threes, switching on, it's been big for us. But we have a lot of great defenders on this team. So it's been a full team effort, but that's something I definitely took personal going from last year to this year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"No, KP didn't talk to us, but we've been playing all season and all playoffs without KP. So it wasn't any surprise for anybody. Obviously we'd love to have KP out there. We are different when he is. But X stepped in that role, and I thought he was great. Defensively I thought he was stellar, and that big shot he made in the corner, I just knew it. I just knew when I drove, they were going to help, and he was going open. And I trusted it all the way. I just knew it was going in. I don't know how to tell you. It was just like a divine experience. I knew X was going to make that shot, and he did. That was big for us. I thought X was great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was a great team win. That lead dwindled fast. I know we were up 20, and then they stormed back. And that's what the beauty of basketball is. You can never let up. It's always time, and they were able to cut the lead. But in those moments, those are the moments which you have to just live for. We've been in those moments a lot. We just needed to be patient, be poised. I feel like we got some good looks. The defensive intensity ramped up. Officiating, you know, got a little bit tighter. So at the end of the day, you've just got to make plays. I thought we got some good looks down the line in the fourth. Some went in. Some didn't. But we were able to make plays and find a way to win. And we've been in those positions, and we've lost. It was great to overcome that with my brother, Jayson, and with our team. That was special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Luka is a great player. I'm going to start by saying that. He does a lot for their team. Offensively has the ball in his hands a lot. It's a tough lift for him. He's been tough. Even with that fourth quarter, those stats, he's still been able to pretty much get to whatever he wants. So we've just got to continue to be better, and that's all I could really say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, sometimes success can be almost not -- I don't want to say a bad thing, but just being able to finish that quarter where we were up 20. You know, start of the fourth, they came out and made some plays. I checked out around that time, and around that fourth quarter, they just stormed all the way back. But, you know, it's like that in basketball. Sometimes when you are winning, comfort kind of sets into your mind. You kind of like relax. Your brain kind of wants to go at ease, and you've got to fight that. You've got to fight that temptation to fall into that because it's still time left to be played and other teams are still competing. And I think even though that lead dwindled fast, we found ways and moments to overcome it. In that fourth quarter I was proud of, we made some big-time plays. Jrue Holiday, D-White, JT was physical, aggressive. Got to the paint, and we were able to finish it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"To answer your first question, I feel like in the first half, I feel like we had some good looks, some good reads. I was finding guys, getting to the paint, getting up into the offense. I was a little bit -- I was letting them off the hook. I felt like they were letting me just have open looks from three, and I was taking the first one and I should have been a little more patient. I was a little bit more patient in the second half of letting the game kind of come to me a little bit more. But it's awesome. I mean, I can't -- I don't even really have words. It kind of doesn't even really feel real right now. I'm just trying to stay in the moment. It feels great to be up 3-0 in the series but the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just seeing what the game is giving me and making the right play. I feel like we got a bunch of great looks. Good things happen when I get to the paint. Sometimes I don't always get to assist. Sometimes it's a hockey assist. But I just like making the defense converge. You have to respect them getting to the basket. And we have a lot of great shooters. I was committed to that all night. I feel like in the first half I could have done it more and I settled for some shots because I have like a big on me. You know, I needed to get to the paint a little bit more. And I did that in the second half, and then in the fourth quarter, and I feel like that's what helped us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"The coaching staff has been fantastic all season long. I've been saying that throughout the regular season, even before we got to the playoffs. Just it's been just super organized. We've walked through all different types of scenarios. We've been like overly prepared and making sure that we know. Sometimes it's like you've got the coaches, they game plan, but they don't always let you know exactly what they are thinking. Like, they tell us everything. Super transparent. And we trusted it. We trust it. I thought that's been great. Joe has been a big reason of that, and he showed himself in these playoffs. He's been coaching his ass off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think definitely it's been some growth, but I think this team has trusted me, especially in this playoffs and those moments to just be who I am. I felt like I've been able to just deliver just by being just being patient and being poised. Those opportunities have presented themselves, and I've been able to take advantage of them. But I give all my credit to my teammates for the trust they had in me to have the ball in my hands and to be able to make those plays."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just being aggressive. You know, running that action with the ball in my hands to finish the third, I wanted to make sure that we got a good quality look. So if they would have overhelped, I would have been ready to kick it out. I saw that I had been making those passes in the first half, and they didn't want to give those threes up. So they kind of were in between, and when I seen that, it was lights out. So I just went up and finished it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Experience is the best teacher. All year long we've been hearing about the Celtics are the past, for the last six to eight months, that's all we've been hearing is all the different shortcomings we've had in the past. This is a new team, you know what I mean. We've learned from those experiences. And in these moments, you can see that we learned from it. We stepped up to the plate, and we found a way to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, he's a great person, a great player, and he's doing everything he possibly can to help us win and help get back with us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"No, not at all. I mean, he's just a highly competitive person, and he's doing everything he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say his attitude has ever changed, even when he got hurt in Miami, he still was smiling in the locker room after that. His mindset, his attitude has always stayed the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Just means someone is going to have to step up. We trust every single person on this team, and like you said, they've stepped up this whole postseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Whoever we put out there, we understand they might not be what KP is, but they're going to do whatever it takes to help us win games. I have just as much trust in whoever we put out there as I do in KP."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Just trying to make it difficult for him. He's obviously a great player, and just trying to make him take tough shots. We expect him to play better, so it's going to be more of a challenge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We're just trying to get a good look every time. We don't have a number we need to hit, but just go out there, making the right read, making the right pass, and just getting a good look every time down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, it's how we attack the basket, just get in the paint, crash the defense, try to make the right pass and the right read off of that. I would say that's been our offense the whole year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, every game you can learn from and just understand that it's going to get tougher each and every game. The things we did in Boston might not work this game, so just being able to make the adjustments that we need to and just trust that whatever adjustments they make, we've got an answer for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be crazy in here. We've just got to stick together, and I'm sure we're going to have a lot of Boston fans, too. It'll be fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Just sprinting back, trying to make a play. I don't really have a fear of getting dunked on, so that's kind of part of it. Then just trusting the instincts. Just trying to sprint back and trying to stop a basket any chance I can. I've just kind of been doing it for a while."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It's a learned experience. Over time you learn how to deal with all the extra noise and attention, whether it's positive or not so positive. You know, I'm a fair, smart person. I know when I'm doing things at a high level. I know when I need to do certain things better. So I'm not, like, oblivious to what's going on. At the same time, just keeping the main thing the main thing and focusing on trying to win the next game. That's what's most important at this time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, that's part of it, right? You never, like, completely shut a guy as talented as him out. You've heard it a million times great players, try to make things difficult, show them different coverages, make them work for everything. They're going to make some shots. They're going to miss some shots. You just don't want it to be easy for them to be comfortable. That's with any talented player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I'm a big Matthew fan? We went to school together. I actually watched him win last night. Trying to learn and understand the rules in the game of hockey more and more. I got to watch the game last night. They won. Like I said, I'm extremely happy for him and his family. Hopefully they win it all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think being in the Finals two years ago has helped me in this moment. Like I said, I understand that I do need to be more efficient. I do need to shoot the ball better, I would not disagree with anybody on that. But I'm not letting it bother me. I'm still trying to find ways to impact the game and dominate the game in other areas. I understand that it could take one game. One game, I could explode. All the percentages and things like that could change. So it's just that mindset of I'm one game away or whatever that means. Like I said the other day, I know what it's like to be in this position and lose. This time around, trying to do any and everything possible to have a different outcome. So, yes, I know I need to shoot the ball better. And I plan on it. Not letting that affect everything else that I need to do on the court to help us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yes, that's one thing where I truly do appreciate Joe, aside from being I think an excellent coach, is that I truly do believe that he cares about us, our team as individuals, obviously myself, the conversations that we have. He always, through the season, the summertime, obviously through this postseason, has had days where he's called me, called me into his office. Not necessarily talk about X's and O's, but check on me as a person, how I'm dealing with everything. That does mean a lot for somebody to take time out of his day to show that compassion or whatever, just know that he's there for me. That relationship between yourself and a coach is important. That's something I truly value about the relationship that me and Joe have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, that's just another thing. I think Joe always challenges, in particular me and J.B., to find different ways to affect the game. I think J.B. has taken that up another notch of his conditioning, his ability to essentially chase down and guard guys, like I said, 90 feet from the basket. That's just another way that, obviously, besides his scoring and things like that, that he can positively impact the game that gives us the best chance to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"We're just so much of a better team when we have him. 7-4 unicorn, right? He's as talented as they come. Presents so many matchup problems on the offensive end. Then on the defensive end, somebody that can affect shots, protect the rim as well as he does. So, yes, we've had success and found ways to win without him. Obviously, we're better when he's on the team, when he's out there playing with us. Obviously, he's day to day, doing everything he can to get out there and give us whatever he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to put us in the predicament where it's like I'm shooting not as well, still we can win. I want to shoot the ball well. But I feel I just keep saying it. That's not the only thing that I bring to the table, not being defined by that. Earlier in my career, I was a score the ball and rebound type of guy. How much I've grown and developed as a player, reading the game, understanding what the defense is trying to take away, giving up. It's such a long season that you're not going to make every shot. You're not going to shoot as well as you would like to. The guys that I've studied, the best of the best players, have always just found a way. That's just all I've been trying to do, is find a way to do whatever I can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think that's very good. It's how we come out for Game 3. Got to be the more desperate team. I think if we take care of business and really come out with a purpose, we'll be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,For sure. We're looking forward to it. We like playing on the road. It'll be a good environment to play in.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Definitely.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Well, I didn't go straight to the scorer's table, but I did get Joe's attention or Charles' attention, too, and then they told me get in. I guess you could kind of say I did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"For sure. I think Ive earned that right a little bit to show that I'm able to take those shots, even if they were very difficult. I don't care about my shooting percentage as far as that. I could have been 0 for 9 if I missed that. But that could have been the difference, and who knows from here on out. Maybe that helps me jump start to make the next couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I don't practice them, but I just look at them, and I don't know, I probably zone in more on them. Just like clock is winding down, and you've got nothing to lose."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's special for sure, just the energy the crowd had got us jump started us to start the fourth well. Built momentum. Yeah, those are moments you live for on this type of stage, so that was big time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I probably blacked out a little bit, but like I said, it's just moments that you dream of, of hitting shots like that with the clock winding down. Hopefully I can continue to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Al is in the middle of watching Game of Thrones right now, so a lot of us have seen that. I just re-watched Yellowstone with my fiance and my brother for the third time, so I went through and watched that, also. I love that show."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"What happened? I mean, the tweet that we put out was pretty explanatory. It's kind of a random situation. I felt something, and now I have to deal with it. As we said, yeah, it's going to be day-to-day, and I'll see how I am tomorrow, and obviously I'm going to do everything I can to be out there tomorrow, and we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I am, of course. I have to be. I'm optimistic, and as I said, I will do everything I can to be out there tomorrow. Yeah, we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know. I don't know the specifics. But that's something I'll leave in the medical staff's hands to determine whether I can go or no. But from my side, as I said, nothing is going to stop me unless I'm told I'm not allowed to play. That's the only reason I would not be out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, I don't care. I've been through some stuff in my career, and obviously this is a rough patch coming back and having something happen right away again. It's tough. It's very -- just a tough moment right now. But I'm feeling pretty good. I'm feeling pretty good. Mind is good. We'll see tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know. It was kind of a random situation. It wasn't like I was limping or something I did before this. I was good, and then this happened. I don't think it's anything related, and I don't know, either. The medical staff would know better. It is what it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I'm living by those words. Of course."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, I hope not, but if it comes to that to win, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I was going for a rebound at the free throw line. Just kind of pushed in Lively's back and we bumped knees and something happened. I just kept playing for a while after that. Obviously towards the end my movement was affected a bit. Joe took me out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Some black magic, no? No, I'm joking. No, the first time I came back, I was not playing that game, I was with Washington, and I had a warm welcome here. They even did a tribute video, which was very unexpected for me, but that was very nice. I think the organization, the people on the inside appreciated my time here, and that was very nice. Obviously, I have completely no bad feeling about this place. I love this city, love the fans, and it just didn't work out. I definitely don't expect a comeback like I had in New York. But we'll see tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's pretty close. I think because of the type of player that he is, it's always going to look different because of his versatility."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"That's probably why you asked that question. None of the American ones did. They look at the lens differently of basketball. In America, nothing is ever good enough. It's about what can you do for me right now. It's not always the case in that situation. Yes, I think we are. I think he's only going to get better. He makes greatness look easy because of his ability to impact the game in many different ways. He's going to continue to get better and better and better. It's an honor to coach him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, listen, he's doing anything and everything he can to be ready for the game tomorrow. It's a serious injury. At the end of the day, our team and the medical team is not going to put him in any bad situations. We've taken the decision to play out of his hands because the importance of him. He's going to do everything can he to play. We're going to leave it up to our medical team. That's really it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the growth of him as a player has been, like, not being defined by one thing. When you have your superstar players knowing what it takes to win, they're willing to take that on. Sometimes it's scoring. Sometimes it's defense. Sometimes it's rebounding, passing, executing. I think one of the major growths of Jalen's game is he'll do whatever it takes to win. That could change each game. That could change each series. He's doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"What he would say? He would say, Focus on the details, focus on the fundamentals. The closer you are to winning, the easier it is to become distracted by things that you can't control, things that don't matter. Here are the things that matter, and you got to fight like hell to accomplish those things with simplicity, with discipline and mental toughness. Everything he talked about was about your mindset and your mental toughness. That's what separates you. Thank you for asking the second question. I think it's the most important thing. I think the ability to handle the ebbs and flows, the humility to understand there's a plan that's much bigger than who you are individually. Have an impact on other people. Then using the gifts God has given you to try to impact people. It's my anchor, the most important thing. I've enjoyed the challenge of trying to stick with that even when it's difficult at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I think he's missed some easy shots. I expect him obviously to be even more aggressive and to fight to get those shots. The most important thing is just being detailed in individual defense. It's not about shutting him down. It's about just making it difficult for him because of his ability to impact plays. So we just have to fight for that. He's gotten some good looks. I think we have to guard him better. He's definitely going to be more aggressive. We have to be better at individual defense. We have to be better at our team defense. We have to be better at our details.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the biggest thing is when you get someone and you realize that everything everybody says about them is true, that's probably one of the ultimate compliments you can get. Your character is what it is. It's what you say it is, what other people say it is. I'd say that. Everything everyone said about him when we first got him, it's been even better. Just the type of person that he is. His humility, his competitive nature, the way he treats his family, the way he treats his teammates, how hard he plays, his willingness to do everything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I didn't see it. It is out of his hands. It's his job to fight like hell to put himself in the best possible position to feel as good as he can. We're not going to let him compromise himself. That's been it. To say, We need you, do everything you can, but at the end of the day we got your back and make sure we put you in the best position possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I have no idea.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Criticism is the ultimate beauty. It's a sign of ultimate respect. It's just a beautiful thing. I really love the way Jayson has handled that. It's just a testament to who he is. Shot selection is all about timing. It just depends on the time and score, depends on the spacing, the type of play we ran to get the shot that we want. Nobody knows what's a good shot and what's not except the people in our locker room, because those are the ones that we talk about every single day. We know how important shot selection is. I think the greatest strength of our team is they fight to take the right shot every single time down the floor. They know what a right shot is. They know the importance of how the shot will impact your defense. It will impact or offense. On that particular shot, that was a good shot because we were in offensive rebounding position, the floor was balanced, we had the matchup that we wanted. It allowed us to do both to offensive rebound and get back in transition. I think you just try to learn, try to look at different lenses. I think everybody tries to look at the game the same way. The more you can look at it from a completely different spectrum, it allows you to build connections. It allows you to really focus on where games are really won and lost, and not on the stuff that's easy to notice. I think everyone notices the easy things. It's can you fight to notice the things other people aren't, because you know that's where winning and losing is, is in that space."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Try to use different things to keep the guys engaged. It's a long year. If you keep talking to them about game plans, it gets stagnant. You try to build connections. You figure out what's one thing that can grab the guys' attention for an extra 10 seconds, something outside of basketball that you think can hammer home a point. At the end of the day, that's the most important thing, is making sure you get through to your guys so they listen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I try to be like peers with all of our guys. The age gap is relatively there. I try to have a peer-like relationship with all of them. Then with each guy it's different, because you can break down different barriers -- who is married, who has kids, whose faith is important. Sometimes it's not for people. So you connect differently. I've always had an interesting relationship with Jrue because we share the same app, the Hallow app. Before I met him, he was actually on there. I would listen to his prayers. I got to know his heart. Then I coached him in the All-Star Game. I always had this spiritual connection that we would end up in the same area at some point. I kind of felt like I knew him before I knew him just because of the way he prays, and I knew his heart. Our relationship now is -- sometimes we talk to each other, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we just give a head nod. Sometimes I see his wife, I give them a hug sees my wife, give them a hug. That's it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"You're talking about football, okay. I just want to see if I got you right. I think Neymar has handled the most pressure lately. But because we had a lack of idols most recently. If you are back in 2002, we had Ronaldo, had Rivaldo. We had a great national team. This talent has gone down for the years. Neymar has surged like a huge talent. We put a lot of expectations on him that he can deliver to us another World Cup. I don't think it's pretty fair to him what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I agree. I would say the same thing for Tatum. Also, he's the first No. 10 to take on the weight of Brazil since the social media era. Who before Neymar was involved in that social media area? He's so good, everything you can do can be taken for granted. When he won the gold medal by making the game-winning penalty kick, you would have thought that would have solidified it. It hasn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Most recently, yes. I have a particular opinion, but I have to see the general thing about it, about Neymar. I don't agree of a lot of his actions outside the field."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know him. All I know is the soccer player.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,We should just focus on the soccer player. I don't think that's fair.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Don't get me into the coaches. I mean, don't get me into the football coaches, right? That's like an impossible job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"It's a lot of pressure. It's a huge country. We love football, we love soccer. It's our sport. We were always good at it. It's a lot of pressure. JOE MAZZULLA Yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,Most recently the results were so bad that the pressure is just rising.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I study that a lot because I think we're in a similar environment here as to how to handle all of that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Boston Celtics, probably just from the basketball, as great as the national soccer team. Pretty much the same. JOE MAZZULLA Yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,I know you love soccer. JOE MAZZULLA Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"I know you like Pep Guardiola, and I know you stole some things from his thoughts."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,None of us are that good. We steal from everybody.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Defend the house. When we went out there, we were trying to do what we could. We couldn't get the two wins, couldn't get a win. All right, cool, move on, next play, next game. Now we've just got to bring a different energy, a different light and a different positivity coming into Game 3."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY ii,"Just really getting out in pace. I feel like whenever they slow us down and we end up playing one-on-one, we can't get into our pick-and-roll game because the defense was pulled in and they're expecting it. But whenever we are out in transition, I set a high screen at half court, and Tatum doesn't know if he's going to step up or Porzingis doesn't know if he's going to step up, that's the game we need to get into. Just being able to move the ball, get out and run and make sure that we're not so stagnant with the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It's just understanding the defensive principles. Instead of me protecting the paint, it's me rotating to either wing or rotating to the corner. It's just understanding where you are on the floor, understanding if you see where you need to rotate, it's getting there. There was one time Jaylen Brown cut, I was supposed to rotate corner. I thought he was there, but he was at the rim. It's just always moving your head, keeping your head on a swivel and understanding where you are and who's in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"They're going to be loud. I honestly didn't think it was that loud. There was a bunch of rumors about how Boston is going to be so loud, so nasty. I thought it was going to be worse. So just knowing that, it just makes you want to go out there and perform in front of your own crowd."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Come out there, punch them in the mouth. I feel like we were doing a great job of guarding them, a great job of just going shot for shot with them the majority of the game. A lot of the game just came down to us not being as sound on the defensive end in the fourth quarter, us making free throws and us being able to take care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like whenever you're in games like this, you find out who you really are. You understand what you really want out of this, who you really are, just understanding that whenever you're on the bench, you're here, your teammates just lock into the game. There's nothing else going on in the world that can take your focus away from what's going on in the Finals. There's no other feeling you want to be in and no other place you want to be in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, it's kind of hard to make sure I don't slip up and say anything too inappropriate. But I'm just out there trying to make sure my people hear me. Everybody on the team knows that if I'm mic'd up, making sure you don't say anything too crazy to me. But they know I'm going to talk to them on the defensive side, talk to them on the offensive side, and even if they fall down, I'm picking them back up and giving them positive words of encouragement."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, I feel like they keep coming back to me because they like what they're getting, so I'm going to continue to put on a show, continue to do what I do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just continue to be aggressive. Try to win each possession. Try to win the little battles -- the rebounding game, the diving on the floor, the loose balls, all the little things are going to come down to a win. It's not just the big shots. It's not just the big plays. It's the little plays that are going to give us the boost to give us the extra steps that we need so we can get a breath of fresh air."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",Maxi Kleber,"Like any other time, you have to make sure you stay composed. Its a long series and you want to make sure you play the right way and play your game and dont get affected by outside noise."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think its not about any individual person. I think its overall on the offensive side, creating the space so Kyrie and Luka have it a little easier to create shots for themselves and for us. So we just have to make sure we have the right spacing and putting guys in position to succeed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, but even if not, Ky makes great decisions for us. Even if he has an off shooting night or whatever, it doesnt mean that he played bad for us. We know he has a high IQ, but we can give him a little more space to get some easy ones to create a rhythm."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Its the Finals and you try to take away a lot of things. You contest every shot and make it harder on both sides for both teams. If we have the right spacing and involve the right guys, we can get the shots that we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"We have to take the energy from all the fans and bring it to the court. Come out with the right attitude and get the win. If youre at home, you have to take advantage of it, just like Boston did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think he's one of the best players in the world. You're trying to just make it tough. That's all you can do, is hopefully guard the first move, guard the second move, guard the third move and contest. Guys are doing that at a high rate, trying to make it tough on him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought Exum did a great job in Game 2. We'll look to see if we can get that combination out there a little bit more as a third ball handler. Defensively, I thought he did a really good job. He's one of the few that has made a three in this series. He knocked down the open three. We're going to need that a little bit more from him. I thought the pace he came with was really good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their defense, just understanding -- I thought Luka did a great job of getting off to a great start scoring. It's just understanding who's on and who he's involving in the pick-and-roll. We have to do a little bit better job of that. Again, he's getting where he wants to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"That's what they say. We're home. Understanding that Boston held serve, that's what we're talking about, is just focusing on Game 3. We felt in Game 2 we had opportunities we just let get away from us. For us at home, protecting home court. But the cliche is role players play better at home, so we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It's easy, just say relax. I think the urgency started for us awhile back. I think we're used to that. I think the game of basketball is about makes and misses and capitalizing on mistakes. We just haven't had that opportunity to capitalize. We're getting stops. We're turning the ball over, give up a three. Understand coming down the stretch we had to play perfect. Hopefully the game is close coming down the stretch and we can capitalize on their mistakes. But there's two teams playing, so we can relax and enjoy this and have fun. That's what it's all about. Hopefully we can do that tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"You look at White and Holiday are comfortable -- Holiday is very comfortable in the dunker. He plays as the big. Being able to not just put the ball in the basket, but also to be a playmaker from that position. He's a willing passer. When you talk about a point guard or a versatile guard, those two can playmake from there. So they put a lot of pressure. It's a little different when you have smalls in the dunker. For us, we had to do a little bit better job of understanding who is down there. Again, Boston is a very talented team when you talk about the four around one. They have four shooters on the perimeter. They can playmake. They're very willing passers. Sometimes in this league you've got to give up something. Right now, they're taking advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"This is an incredible atmosphere. To win that championship in 2011, the city is incredible. They love their Mavs. To win it then and now to be here in '24 is special because you don't really get an opportunity to do that. I understand the opportunity that I have to be the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. It's a dream come true. But we're trying right now to figure out how to win one game, and that's the next one tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I've been saying it all year failure is the best teacher at times. It can inspire you to do great things. It's our first time being in the Finals as a team with this group. We understand who we're up against, the competitive level, the nature of the Finals, the competitive level we have to play at. Also, the adjustments that we have to make out there on the floor just as players. The coaching staff is doing a great job of preparing us. But it's our job as players to make those adjustments and play even harder, especially when the game is getting a little out of balance, we have a lead and we want to extend it a little bit. A lot of it is just a learning curve for myself, for my teammates, and also a peace of mind that we give each other that we want to give ourselves a chance by leaving it all out there on the floor, playing our best, preparing the best way we can. That's literally been the focus since Game 2 ended, was putting our best foot forward, coming back home, feeling familiar, letting our game speak for itself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"First thing of that is just accepting that I haven't played well or up to my standards, as well as I would have liked. Being back in Boston, there's such a level of desire that I have inside of me to play well. Wanted to be there for my teammates. As a competitor, it's frustrating. But I don't want to let that seep in or spill over to any other decisions I have to make there as a player. Continue to feed my teammates' confidence. Have been down 0-2 before -- lost a series, won a series. I know what it takes. Also how to prepare for something, like, that mentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically. First is just respecting your opponent, then most importantly putting your best foot forward out there when we go out there. It's as simple as that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"He's been playing great. He's been one of the emotional leaders on the team. Defensively he's making it difficult. That's what he's been doing all year. For the past few years, he's tried to make his mark on that end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game. I can be a lot more fundamentally sound, technical on my shots, not get into the paint often where it's three or four guys around me, I'm not making a pass. They're sending specific strategies against me to make it difficult. We're at the highest stage in the world. It's a small sample size. We only get a seven-game series potentially. I just can feel the stakes being raised up a little bit more. The pressure is natural. Makes diamonds. For us as a team, we just have to control what we can control on that end. Being able to match their pace, but also feel good about ourselves when we get stops. When we get stops, get out in transition, we're a better team. When we're getting stops and giving up offensive rebounds or we're getting stops and turning the ball over, it hurts our chances to even be in the game. The margin of their victories hasn't really displayed the full story in terms of the Celtics beating us. We just have to continue to lean in on each other, especially when it gets tough out there. We're going against a great team. They're not going to stop pressing us, stop their pace, stop testing us on both ends of the floor. We know what we're in for. But now we have to raise it to an even higher level, and it starts with me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Sharing with them that it took a lot of resilience. It took a lot of will to win in 2016. That's also a different team. We had time to fail together. We had time to go through our trials together. We lost in 2015. A lot of guys came back in 2016 and we won. So there was an inner motivation there. We also knew who we were going against, how well they played. I think if you have a healthy way or perspective of looking at where we are now, it feels like we are that team that's gaining the experience, that's being able to fail at this level. Now we have an opportunity to respond. That's all you can ask for in a basketball season. If you asked me in September or October, would I want a chance to be down 0-2 and having a chance to respond in Game 3 or be out of the Playoffs, I think I would choose the former. It's as simple as that in terms of putting it in perspective. We're the only teams left. This is about chess. That's all it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think it starts with just being aware of your own goals, what you want to accomplish, your team goals, how you can help accomplish that. Also what's going to bring you peace of mind off the court when you leave it. Some of us would say family, video games, other business entrepreneurial opportunities. Just helping you have a healthy balance with the game. The game is going to be a game. It's going to torment you emotionally. You're going to fail, succeed, make shots, miss shots. You want to be able to go home to a great family, people that love you unconditionally, those that are going to be truthful with you. I'm grateful I've been able to build a tribe around me that has all those. Dealing with a lot of the criticism, when you're young, even when you're older, how to accomplish something like I'm trying to do right now, there's going to be a lot of people that want to see you fail. Get used to that too. There are going to be a lot of people that are going to be naysaying, want to see you kind of destroy yourself in the process. I would say just focus on the people that really love you for you. Your teammates are there to support you, especially when you know them throughout. Then trusting the people that have been there before you. They'll give you a lot of advice to help you reason or rationalize what's going on. That's a great question, brother. It took me awhile to figure that out and find that peace of mind. That's why you get a chance to see me up there. I definitely want to see you accomplish that peace of mind a lot earlier than I had to. It's not worth it to let anybody's opinions get to the best of you. Or people that have never been in our position don't know what it takes, don't know the sacrifices, never will, but they guess, and they try to make it up. Show them respect, but at the same time understand that we're all human at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it started with me just telling my hermano I got to play better for him, alongside him. In order for us to accomplish our goal, we both have to be playing well and we both have to be doing the little things, doing whatever it takes to win. Easy conversation. But it started with me reaching out, just letting him know it's my fault, taking accountability for not playing particularly well. But also I got to continue to trust my guys around us or around me. I need to have fun in the process. We've gotten this far because we've been a great team, not because we've just put it on me and Luka. It's been a total team, organizational effort to get this far. We just got to keep trusting in that. Pretty simple conversation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Rather win smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, we definitely have had some moments of positivity on the defensive end where we've gotten the missed shots. Again, I just remember one play that comes to mind, where potentially we could be down six. Pritchard hits a three going into the fourth quarter where it gives a little bit more breathing room to have the game in their hands. Just being aware of some of the plays that they're going to try to make at the end of quarters, the plays they make at the start of the game to get them going a little bit, the plays they run when we're in the lead. We've had the lead in the first quarter -- 12-6, 13-6 both times. We're feeling good about ourselves, and they come out and run the same play four times in a row. Our IQ has to be at a higher level. Also, our communication and trust has to be at an ultimate level where we can just trust our instincts out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,I just know hes going to do everything he can to get on the floor. Hoping for the best.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,Lets see. Well see how everything goes. Just have to wait and see if he is going to play or not. I feel like we have plenty of guys who should be able to come in and help contribute. We just have to wait.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,"He feels pretty good. From what Ive seen, he seems pretty optimistic. For him, were just wishing that he is going to do everything he can to get himself going. Anything that he can give us, well appreciate it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,"For us, its just continuing to do what weve been doing all year. Being consistent on the defensive end. On offense, playing the way we want to play. Just being consistent. Our team has been this all season. Now we have a great opportunity in Game 3 to come in here. We understand its not going to be easy. Its going to be a tough game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Trying to be the hungrier team. We're going to go out there and try and execute a game plan, and I think most of us just try and do it together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP is tough. Whatever decision he makes is his decision. But he's a tough guy. Obviously whatever decision he makes, I'm supportive of it. But that's mostly up to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP always has a great attitude. That's something you don't have to worry about. He's just like this joy and this light. Anytime he walks into a room, no matter what's going on, he brings that every time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's team defense. We do it as a team. It's not just one person, it's everybody. We just try to defend him, we try to show him bodies, multiple people, and just try to make it difficult."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think we still have spacers. I think we try to do our best to get into the right spacing or get into the right positions and try to do as best we can.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's hard. I've sacrificed a lot. I've missed out on a lot of my kids' stuff just to be here. But the journey is cool, and I think just the friends and the family that I've met along the way has made it worth it, and the fact that my family is here with me makes it even more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"You've got to talk to him. I can only imagine. It would be tough, right? Missing a lot of the Playoffs and then coming to the Finals and then getting hurt at the end, it would be hard. But KP is a tough guy, and he knows himself very, very well. Again, like I said, he's been bringing this energy and this positivity that he's just always brought, this light, and he'll continue to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think that's been here. I think that trust has been here. That chemistry has been here. We just embodied it from the beginning. That wasn't anything that had to grow over time. That just came naturally.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's not any different. I did it in Milwaukee, too. I'm not really sure people actually knew that but there's a lot of time being in the dunker and trying to space the floor and have the best spacing, but I think for this team, me down there trying to make plays out of the dunker a lot of the time helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Getting the ball to JT and JB. The way they've been playing, the way they've been touching the paint and getting to the basket has been huge for us, and one of the reasons why we had such a good game last game. Again, I think JT driving and attracting two or three people and collapsing the defense has made our offense a lot easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,All I know is that he is working his butt off to try to be ready to go for tomorrow. Thats really all I know.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I think that is the beauty of our team. Were friends off the court as well as on the court. Not every team youre on is like that. Every guy gets along with each other. Dach guy individually has his own personality, but it all kind of works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"He obviously poses a lot of different threats for us and the other team. Wed love to have him out there, but if he cant go, everybody just has to step up. Weve shown we can do it throughout the Playoffs when hes not there to play, but obviously were really hoping he can play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,We just have to be laser focused. I think the biggest challenge is being on the road. Dealing with the fans. Players are usually more comfortable on their home court. We just have to come out and be ready to go.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Its a must-win for us. We need to come out aggressive and deliver the first punch and make sure were ready to go as a team. As far as adjustments, I think we need to be a lot better at just overall. Offensively, weve been awful. We know we need to be better. We know what we need to do. Its just about us doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah. The guys are definitely excited to come back to Dallas. Weve been on the road now for a week. Coming home and getting the energy from the crowd, I think its only going to help us. I think were really looking forward to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think every single game in every single playoff series is a must-win. But I think for this, we have to win this game. Thats the intent going into this game its a must-win game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Coach has been good because obviously he has been in this position before and knows what its like as a player, too. Obviously, he has had his message and hes been able to get that across to the team. In saying that, he has also done a great job of being able to hear the players opinions and how we feel like we can fix things. So I think its been a mixture of both. But obviously I think it comes down to aggression and just having trust and confidence in one another."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"We need to make them. Its obviously frustrating not making them, but at the same time, we need to make sure were taking every opportunity, even if we are missing. At the end of the day, its going to get better. Were not going to keep missing. Its been a big emphasis. Weve been shooting a lot, getting extra reps in. We know what were capable of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Weve been shooting great throughout the Playoffs. I think its an adjustment. A little bit of jitters in the first game. Its one of those things now, its do or die. We need to make those shots. Thats just how it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, it feels great just to be back on the home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much with me, just the same as coming out from the last game setting the tone physically. Just come out with energy, match everything that they're throwing at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"The only thing I would say they're probably doing differently is just 1 through 5, switching on every screen-and-roll. But we've found ways to get around that. Of course we want to get a lob every now and then, but we can find other options on the floor besides lobs. It's always good because we have a lot more weapons in our arsenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Just have patience. Not necessarily letting them speed us up and then find the loopholes when it comes to their defense.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like everything matters when it comes to just like being in the Finals in general. Free throws are big, like you said. Making more shots, of course. But like I said, just stay patient with the game, let stuff come to us and not let us get sped up when it comes to what we want on the floor offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It's a blessing to be in a situation like this, coming from the situation that I was in. Just that next step in my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like a segment of some stint of the last game, we found ways to be able to do that. We have to make them take the shots that we want. Once we get to that point and we can do it consistently, I feel like that's when we can make them uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just believe in him. Find ways to get him downhill. At the end of the day, just try to keep him as motivated as possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, it's been a minute, in all honesty, just to have a post-up play for me, for sure, so it is new to me. Most definitely it's just something that me, J-Kidd, anybody else on the team that has seen it, if we see anybody down there when it comes to like a mismatch, I always throw it down there and we can just play out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, for sure. The whole team is helping me. Everybody is having fun because at the end of the day it's the NBA Finals. There are going to be challenges. There's going to be obstacles. There's going to be adversity. We find ways to get through that as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like it's going to be the same. I always loved just coming here and playing with the home crowd involved. I heard it's a sold-out game tomorrow, so hopefully it's going to blow the roof off, most definitely. They should hear us on the other side of Texas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think that the biggest thing is we know they're going to collapse when we drive, so I think the biggest thing for me and what we've talked about is playing off two feet, whether that's a lay-up, going aggressive, or knowing that they're going to collapse and finding open shots. That's the biggest thing going into this game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I'm a guy that no matter the situation in any game, I'm always going to try and put up that shot. Like it happened that other game, I think it was an important basket for them, kind of cut the momentum a little bit going into the quarter. But yeah, I think a lot of the times it's shots that we practice a little bit, and I think we're good enough players to make it. He obviously got lucky on that one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I've hit a few. I've hit a few. Mine are mostly deep, past half court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, actually last year, I actually kind of went through a thing with one of my teammates about kind of a process of what I would do to shoot, and I think he was kind of a launch type, and I'm a shoot. I'll stop off two and kind of shoot and aim it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well. But I think credit to Live and Gafford they're playing in a role where they have to defend out on the perimeter, but as much as we can get them back to the basket, we will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, I think they have enough guys talking to them. I think it's a lot of process. We've been watching a lot of film and making sure. But I'm confident in their ability."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, I think some people get lost in the emotion of everything, and yeah, you have to kind of remind guys to, hey, I'm mic'd up. But I think it's just the moment and everything. Even mic'd up or not, I think guys, we're going to say what we want to say. But I'm always pretty calm, so I won't say too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"First, I feel good. I don't want to get in any more details. But I feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think it's up a notch, for sure. Both teams played a lot of games throughout the season. But I think the physicality has been on point, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I would say it's different. Just being 18 and 25 is a big difference. But it's different games. Here, you play first to four. In the EuroLeague, it's just one game. It's way different. I wouldn't just say that game prepared me for now. It's throughout my career that prepared me for these moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I saw him before when I started driving. I saw him at that spot. So when I went for the layup, I saw him, I knew he was going to be open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Very helpful. He can dribble the ball. He can play point guard. He can help us both. Save our energy. He can just bring the ball up. He can make plays, too. It's good that he was able to play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, our defense built in five guys. Our low man is very important. So no matter who is the low man, we know we going to do a great job. We've worked on this the whole season, preseason. I've been in that position a lot with the low man. We've been working on it since preseason. We feel confident with that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just one thing Keep shooting. We all believe in those shots. That's how we came to the Finals. That's how we played the whole season. We believe in those guys. Everybody believes. If you're open, just keep shooting. You're going to knock it down at some point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just trying to keep getting open looks. I think our defense has not been bad. We can't really score. That's our main problem right now. But I think we getting some great looks. Like I say, we have confidence everybody can make a shot shooting the ball on our team. We just got to keep believing in it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"You could say that. I like to pride myself that I always try to play with that fire and that passion. I feel like that's what makes me who I am, the essence of why I play and how I play. But my experiences, the heartbreaks, the losses, have all kind of cultivated into what you see now. I don't want to feel that again. I think that's fair to say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's been fun. Personally, I think it's been necessary. I think anytime you want to achieve something great, it's going to take a little bit of sacrifice from every individual to get to where you want to go. Me going into this season, I knew that being one of the leaders, that would be in front of me on my plate. I didn't mind it. It's translated to us being here in the Finals. The sacrifice is necessary not just in sports but in life, if you want to achieve a goal, to some degree."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"For me, it's different for every individual, but it's almost like you got to trick your mind almost in a sense. You almost got to play like you're down 0-2 rather than up. That's hard to do. You got to go into that mind frame, that focus. Now we are playing like that, rather than you let comfort, you let some of those things kind of seep in. You just try to stay focused and try to harness the mind as much as you can. The mind is a powerful thing. It's hard to grasp some of those things as you are intaking them. If you can kind of focus your mind on what you want it to focus on, you'd be surprised what you can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Gotten to know Jrue a lot. Jrue is, like I described it in the beginning of the season, he's like an assassin. He just has a will and a might about him, how he plays, that he'll die on the battlefield. I'm the same. You recognize that and you respect that. His will is unbreakable. He's going to show up. He's going to be there. He's going to be in the fight with you. I've been against him on the other side, so you could feel it. You could feel like this dude's not going anywhere. I think that's where the respect for me and him, just being opponents, but now him being on the same team, it's an honor. It's been an honor to be his teammate because of how he carries himself. His willingness to sacrifice, his willingness to adapt, and then be successful where he's adapting to. For example, this year was different than last year. He's like mastered being a corner three-point shooter. He wasn't that at any other point in his career. He took the role on this new team and developed into almost a new player. I don't overlook stuff like that. I think those are forms of greatness. Even though we expect greatness to be these things that are so large or so captivating. Stuff like that doesn't go unnoticed to guys like me. It's been an honor to be his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. Team camaraderie, you're going to experience this, it's probably the hardest thing to gain in the NBA. A bunch of guys, a bunch of egos. Agents telling them one thing they feel another way. Having everybody on the same page is probably going to be the hardest thing you're going to be trying to experience throughout your career. I think it always starts from the top. Like, you look at the top guys. Me and JT, we've been here the longest, and we set the tone from the jump. Everybody else kind of has to follow along. That's kind of what has worked for us. Every locker room, every organization, is a little different. You got to figure out how to get your team into that same vibe. It's hard enough to get two people on the same page. Trying to get 12 or 15, all the way bought in, there's going to be some challenges. That's where leadership step in. As you develop as a leader, those are the type of things that you learn. You improve, you build relationships with guys, you talk to guys on the court, off the court, they start to trust you. That's how you start to build some of those good habits. But it don't happen overnight, I'll tell you that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Same old, same old. KP has been tremendous for our group, not just in the Playoffs, but all season long. It's obvious him on the floor just helps elevate us to a different level. But we've been priding ourselves on next-man-up mentality. We prepare for these moments to be able to play with or without anyone. It just requires somebody else on our team to step up and everybody to buy in to get a full team victory."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, just sprinting back, trying to make a play. Obviously they were making a little run there and whatever means necessary, just sprint back and meet him at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think my first three steps is really important. Just kind of put my head down and run. Then at that time just trust the instincts and trust the timing that I have. So, just putting my head down and sprinting just as fast as I can just to get in position and go up and make a play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"That's what Payton Pritchard does. If you watch us late clock, he doesn't shy away from that moment. That was a big-time shot, kind of got us momentum. You just love Payton. You love competing with him. It was a big-time shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think a lot of credit just goes to the type of people they are. They have done so much. I can't begin to talk about how thankful and grateful I am for Jrue just kind of allowing me to kind of take that next step. He could easily have came in and be, like, I'm Jrue Holiday, and I'm like, You are Jrue Holiday, a hundred percent laughing. But he kind of just did a little different than what he's done the last few years and just each game getting more comfortable. KP, the same way. Just love being teammates with both of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, the whole year the strength of this team has been one through however many guys we got. We trust whoever goes in the game and those guys just work so hard. Every time anybody checks in the game, they just give us great minutes. So we trust everybody, and everybody is making big plays for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, that's why I got dunked on earlier. But it's part of the game. I think just that not afraid to get dunked on allows me to get some that maybe some other people wouldn't have gotten. So just trying to make a play, just believing in my abilities and what I can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, that experience, that just championship DNA, which you hear all about all the time. You don't really know what it takes until you do what it takes. Just the moment he came to our team in training camp, he kind of just had that presence about him. He just knows how to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DAVID FOGEL,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are excited to be in Boston for Game 2 of the NBA Finals and to present the 2024 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award. On behalf of Coaches Association President Rick Carlisle and all of our great NBA head and assistant coaches, I would like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, Michael Levine, Tim Frank, Paul Benedict, Mark Broussard and the entire NBA for all of the league support and assistance in providing this platform to honor the extraordinary achievements of our great NBA coaches. We are especially proud of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who over an outstanding career set the standard for integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion of NBA basketball. Chuck was an incredible mentor to so many coaches and players in our league, including Coach Carlisle and Coach Tomjanovich. With that, I would like to turn it over to Coach Carlisle. Thank you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"Thanks, David. Adam, thanks again. This is just such a wonderful opportunity each year to honor basketball royalty. I first want to thank our selection committee Bernie Bickerstaff, Billy Cunningham, Joe Dumars, Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley, Donnie Walsh and Lenny Wilkens. These eight committee members have been with us through the 16-year history of this. I think this is our 17th year. The winners of this award over the years, it began here in 2009. The first Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award winner was Tom Heinsohn, who was the guy that originated the Coaches Association back in the early '70s, followed by Jack Ramsay, Tex Winter, Lenny Wilkens, Pat Riley, Bill Fitch, Bernie Bickerstaff, Dick Motta, K.C. Jones, Jerry Sloan, Al Attles, Hubie Brown, Frank Layden, Del Harris, Larry Brown, Mike Fratello, Rick Adelman and, of course, Rudy this year. Of all the recipients that we've had for this award, I don't think we've ever had someone whose profile was so similar to Chuck Daly's himself. Both Rudy and Chuck were back-to-back NBA championship winners. They both were Olympic gold medalist coaches. Interestingly, Rudy one-upped Chuck a little bit. He has a media cooperation award named after him that was established in 2011. And Rudy told me it used to be the Chuck DalyRudy Tomjanovich Award, and somehow it just shifted and now it's only Rudy. So that's pretty cool. But both Chuck and Rudy are guys that were beloved, unconditionally respected within the coaching profession, and guys that were able to get the very, very best out of a wide range of different kind of players and were so great and made so many people feel special and made the players that they coached feel special. I want to recognize Sam Cassell, who is in the back. Sam was, I think, on both back-to-back teams in Houston. Hit the big shot against New York the first year, I remember that, in the Garden. He'll be coaching tonight. We tried to see if he can come out on the court for us for the award ceremony, but he's got a job to do over there so we can't pry him away. But appreciate you being here. Rudy also authored one of the great postgame comments in NBA history. I want to make sure I get this right ""Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion."" So it gives me great pleasure, great privilege to introduce Rudy Tomjanovich as this year's recipient of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Thank you very much. I want to thank Rick, David and the Coaches Association for this honor, the guys on that selection committee. If you had a poll of my favorite guys, all those coaches. The great thing about this award is it came to me out of the blue. I had no idea I was up for this. I happened to be with my son up in Houston when I got the call and Rick started telling me about it. I got emotional. My son kept asking, ""Are you okay? Are you okay?"" Then he told me what the award stood for, and finally I hung up, and I told him, ""No, everything's great."" And then I did cry. The reason is, when something like this happens, I'm not thinking about the championships. I'm not thinking about all the good stuff. I'm thinking about the dark days, the days when I doubted myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,That's pressure.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And he said, ""I promise you, I will give you everything I've got."" And he did. Now, a little bit got lost in the translation because he's really country and I'm really city. He would say some words like ""yonder"" and stuff like that. But we came up with a system for the players we had, and that's my philosophy as a coach. You don't keep the same plays every year you change it for the talent you have. And of course we had Hakeem Olajuwon. I would not be here if I did not have his cooperation and his belief. He was fantastic and a classy guy. I had great players on that team. Every time I see them -- I see Sam. I'm looking for the day that Sam Cassell is a head coach, and I want to see him cussing at players the way I cussed at him. The other thing I want to say is I made a lot of good moves. I made some crazy moves. I traded Robert Horry twice. But I really believe he belongs in the Naismith Hall of Fame. He's proven it time and time again. He's made so many teams champions playing a role, and that's so important. It isn't about just the stats. It's about getting results. I pray that one day he's going to be able to stand up there and accept that honor. I want to thank the owners that had confidence in me to run their teams Charlie Thomas, Les Alexander and Jerry Buss. But especially the players. Then of course my assistant coaches. I still talk to my assistant coaches. We're like brothers. We still talk basketball. Having Carroll with me, just think about being in a high-pressure job with your older brother sitting right next to you. So that brought me a lot of comfort. I'm just blessed to be here. Thank you, guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"If I could, I just want to mention something that happened earlier today. Rudy had a thing to go speak to NBA Entertainment. We went over to the JW Marriott and went down to this huge room, and it was really interesting to me. You see the NBA Entertainment people here and there and around the building, but there was a group of over a hundred people that were together. There were whiteboards with all kind of stuff written Stay on this guy, this could happen. It was like an unbelievable thing. Rudy spoke to these people today, and it gave, really, a unique perspective. He was fantastic. I also want to mention Rudy's girlfriend, Lisa Marcussen, is here as well. So thank you for being here. I know we have some questions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"The truth behind it is it came from Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns, who said, ""The Rockets have the heart of a champion. That's why they beat us."" They had us down a couple years, and we fought back and won that series. Now, Charles Barkley had another quote. He said, ""They're like those damned Texas roaches you step on them and you think they are dead, and they scurry away."" I thought I would pick his better than, you know laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,Jim Boylen.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Yeah, we all started in the film room. I was in the film room for Bill Fitch. In fact, I have to give Bill Fitch so much credit. He worked my butt. I'm telling you, if I had a smile on my face, ""You need some more to do."" I did the video. I broke down the video. I did the scouting report. I did the walk-through and the college scouting. That's five people's jobs right there. But it prepared me to be a solid coach. I need stuff like that. When I don't have stuff to do, my mind wanders. I get in trouble when I start thinking too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy and I both worked for Coach Fitch. Coach Fitch told me the story that he used to have Rudy, when Rudy first started as an assistant coach, in the visiting arenas, he would go to the top of the arena with a camera. Bill called it the wide angle. Bill always wanted to have the wide angle in case there was some kind of incident that happened that the TV cameras wouldn't quite get. If you can envision a guy who is a future Hall of Famer as a coach, and probably should be as a player as well, up at the top of ARCO Arena in Sacramento, with a small video cam, filming the game as it's going on, and Carroll Dawson was the only guy on the bench at the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,That's right.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"Talk about paying your dues, pretty amazing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I remember as we pulled into Hobby Airport, which is a small airport in Houston, the fans were there at 300 in the morning. That inspiration was unbelievable. But I stopped at the front of the plane and I said, ""Guys, if I told you all we had to do was win two home games and we would be world champions, wouldn't you think that's a heck of a good deal?"" Then we played a hell of a team. Maybe the worst team for us to match up with, with New York, because they had all the big guys, and this was an era where there was a lot of rustling and bumping. Good defense was bump the guy at halfcourt, bump him at the top of the key. So we had to come up with a strategy because at that time, we were sort of what I call a one primary scorer in Hakeem, and I relied on him so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I like being an assistant coach. I love helping people. I love the game. I cannot tell you what basketball did for me. I mean, I was from a very poor family. My parents were not educated. My father went to the second grade. My mother went to the sixth grade. They were so shy. I didn't even know how to sit at a table and have a meal because we only had one table and we only had two chairs. So I was so behind as far as being socially compatible with the world. But basketball, I started playing that game, and luckily for me, in my hometown, which is in the middle of Detroit, at our junior high, all the great players in that area would come and play there because we had an L-shaped recessed pole because you get killed playing in Detroit with a straight pole, and I got to play basketball there. If you guys got time, I'll tell you a little bit about my other sport. I played baseball as a kid. Was an All-Star. Played against the greatest Little League player of all time. Art ""Pinky"" Deras, Hamtramck, Michigan, in 1959, went to Williamsport and won. So that's what we did. I had an uncle, my cousin who played second base, he said, ""You've got to have a game plan. You ain't going to college unless you get a scholarship. Your family doesn't have it."" So we had a plan. Baseball was going to be it. I didn't love baseball, even though I was good at it. For some reason, I loved basketball. But in junior high, I never played one second. I got in against the teachers. I had the French teacher isolated. I shook him. I shot it. Air ball. Laughter That was my junior high career. So when I told my uncle I was quitting baseball, he says, ""What about our plan?"" I said, ""I'm going to do basketball."" He says, ""Rudy, you're an All-Star in baseball. You sit on the bench."" I said, ""I'm going to go out for the team."" So I go out for the freshman team, and a day before the cut, one of my buddies said, ""Hey, man. I'm in the coachs home room. I saw the list. You ain't on the list."" I said, ""Are you on the list?"" He said, ""Yes."" I went, ""I'm better than you."" Now, the coach was an ex-University of Michigan linebacker who knew nothing about basketball. He just took the job to make some extra bucks. So me being a shy kid, I would never approach somebody, but I wanted to play basketball so I challenged the guy, before he could announce the cut, to a one-on-one game. He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug. At that playground, at that junior high, Detroit Pistons came there. Mel Daniels, college All-American, I played against him there. That's where I learned the game. I was so lucky. But like I said, social skills, when I think about I'm a coach and I've gone up and I get so locked up trying to give a speech. In fact, I think I was telling Rick, when I was in junior high, this teacher said, ""Man, you need to get out of your shell. You need to run for class president."" I said, ""Oh, no, that's not me."" I didn't know how to do a speech and all that. I go up to the microphone, I'm so nervous. I grab my fingers and crack my knuckles into the mic and everyone starts laughing. It was the most embarrassing thing. I had a sadistic friend that wouldn't let them stop. He brought it the sound volume up and the roars kept going. I said, ""I'm never going to speak to anybody again."" To think that I'm up here doing this stuff. The long road it took, that journey. But basketball was the vehicle, man. Basketball does so much. All sports do it. I just feel lucky as hell."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Pinky, we had nicknames in our city. It was a Polish city. So we had a girl who went to Wimbledon at a very young age. Her name was Peaches Bartkowicz. What was so wonderful, I'm so blessed that at our little park -- Hamtramck has one square mile, and we had a park there. We had a Hall of Fame tennis coach who taught at the courts there and then the Little League stuff and that was all volunteer coaches. So Pinky, he was in the Cardinal farm system. He went up there and came back and became a policeman in the suburbs. He passed away maybe five years ago. Such a humble guy. His kids never knew what a great baseball player he was. And then Samuel, there was something about Sam. Back then, I was a head coach, but I still thought like a scout. So I did the tapes and I did Sam first. He was like the fourth-rated point guard that year from the scouting services. I watched Sam first. I said, ""I like this guy, he's pretty damn good."" And I looked at the guys ahead of him and I said, ""No, no, no, I'm going back to Sam."" I wound up watching every game of Sam's. Then we brought him in for an interview and we just clicked. He was a basketball player. He was like the guys on that court that I played. He wasn't thinking about golf then or doing this and all that I'm a player. When he goes in the gym, he's one of the alpha guys. He's going to be in there. We kept calling him, ""Where have you visited, where have you gone?"" Nobody even brought the guy in to interview him. I couldn't believe it. I think Robert might have been -- I can't remember which one was first, but those are my babies, and I want the best for them. I was lucky the Rockets gave me the ability to make the picks. A lot of times, you have a different department doing it and it doesn't jive. It was a perfect storm. We were a family. We worked so well together. And then bringing Clyde Drexler back in to join Hakeem, maybe the only star that we could have made that trade for in the middle of the season because they had that relationship. I would have said, ""No, I'm going to give loyalty to these guys. I'm going to let them defend their championship."" But we were so bad. We had gotten happy feet. We were losing to teams that we shouldn't, and it became available. We said, ""Let's pull the trigger."" And Clyde was phenomenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Well, you know, it's funny. I looked at the assets. I looked at the positive of players and I would get excited. It's like chemistry. What he can do what this guy can do and all that and how you put that together. I loved diagramming something that not everybody is doing and put -- maybe that guy is better going left we'll shift the floor. First of all, treating people with respect, until they prove they don't deserve it. And I did. I just loved -- when I saw a player, it looked like all the things he could do was such an asset. I think that that's why they felt -- they would say a player's coach. I don't know what a player's coach is. There is a separation. You have different roles and all that. As a young guy, I'm sure Joe Mazzulla has had to go through all that stuff, learning how to do things. Sometimes you've got to be tough. In fact, the year that we did decide to do the trade, I had what I called two helicopter halftimes. That's when you take your coat off and you swing it around your head and you throw it and get upset. But it doesn't happen often. So I hope that answered it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think that we responded really well. You know, the way their defense is set up and how much they're loading up and converging at the rim, it just puts us in positions to attack and find the easy kickout reads and just to keep the ball popping and things like that so we can get good to great shots on each and every possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, every time I'd take a couple dribbles, there was, like, three people were right there. So we got a bunch of shooters on our team and guys that can space the floor. They kept leaving Jrue open. So it wasn't like I had to do anything spectacular. It was just about finding the open guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Good thing we don't have to find out. We're very, very fortunate to have him and he was excellent tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah. And you guys are smart enough to know the way our team is set up. Like, we have so many talented guys on both ends of the floor, that it could be a number of guys on a given night. We have a really talented team, and that's how we win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, the way they started the game, right? They were playing faster. You could tell that they wanted to shoot more threes. Neither team really shot the ball well from the three, but you could tell that that was part of their plan, just to play faster and shoot more threes and crash the glass a lot more as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, there's different ways, I guess, to phrase that. It's not all about scoring. I can be the guy rebounding and getting assists and drawing attention, right? I'm going to have the ball in certain spots, right? I draw so much attention. It's not always -- I'm not always going to be the guy to get the shot, but sometimes sacrificing, being in those spots to make the play that we get the best shot possible, knowing that what they want to take away in their schemes and things like that. So being the guy in different ways. Maybe you don't score all the points, but you do all the things that put your guys in the best position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It has a lot to do with that I've been here before and we didn't win, and it's just like, you know, we're so close to what we're trying to accomplish, why would I let my ego or my need to score all the points gets in the way of that. There are going to be times where I need to score, and obviously, I need to shoot better. Golly. But you know, really, we always talk about do whatever it takes for however long it takes. If I need to have 16 potential assists every single night and that's what puts us in the best position to win and it doesn't mean I'm the leading scorer, by all means, if that gives us the best chance to win, sign me up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That was a big-time play for those guys to get back. I fell on the ground, so as soon as I just turned my head and looked up, I seen that they made a play at the rim. That was big, guys making winning plays at crucial times on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think, from a team aspect, it's just a natural process. There's a lot that goes into joining a new team, from a personal standpoint and then, you know, you've been so used to a different organization, now you come to a new team and having to learn personalities and play style and things like that. I've had a relationship with Jrue from a few years ago, we won a gold medal. So I would just, I guess, check in or always remind him, I guess, that, you know, to be yourself and, we're going to need you in big moments, obviously like tonight. Not that maybe he didn't need the reminder, but just letting him know throughout the season how much we value him and things like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Very important obviously. To go to Dallas now 2-0. Its going to be some tough games on the road, but its good we took care of business tonight and go to Dallas up 2-0."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I feel good. Feeling good. Yeah, I dont think its anything serious. But we will look at it tomorrow and go from there, but all good. Ill be good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Today I felt better. A little better conditioning. Like I said before, even though I had a really good comeback game, its tough to jump into the rhythm like that and have the conditioning and have the rhythm and have all of those things. But I think I did a decent job tonight again and helped the team win and thats it. We move forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not difficult at all. Ill die out there if we need. So just kept going. Was a little bit limited, so the smart thing was to get Al back in there and close out the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I think I have to give a shout-out to our best defensive guys like Jrue Holiday, D-White. JB has been tremendous on both ends of the floor. All three of those guys played incredible today. We just have so many weapons that its tough. But defensively, Id say, those guys and Al take us to a different level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, first it starts with our transition defense. If we don't get back and make it five-on-five, it's hard to be able to do that great. And then the ball pressure, and then just the individual pride, taking on the pride of guarding you and then the guys off the ball, being able to do both, shift and get after shooters. Team defense, the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like we got a group of guys that really want to win. Been around a long time, and they want to do it together. When you have a locker room that has ownership and takes it upon themselves to hold each other accountable, you've got a chance. The guys want to win and make that decision, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to win. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, we still do have blind spots. We're always going to have blind spots. I think it's just recognizing those and understanding how we can leverage them by using the guy next to us to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, before that, I think the play of the game can't go unnoticed, the humility of our team, is Payton's shot at the end of the quarter. You see guys around the league pass up on that shot or fake like they want to take it, so that their numbers don't get messed up. He takes pride in taking that, and that's winning basketball. So that's the first and foremost. That should have been the first question, is the ability of everybody on our team to do different things that lead to winning. I'm really tired of hearing about one guy or this guy or that guy and everybody trying to make it out to be anything other than Celtic basketball. Everybody that stepped on that court today made winning plays on both ends of the floor, is the most important thing. To answer your question, Jayson makes greatness look easy. He does it in a lot of different ways. He does it on defense, he does it on rebounding, he does it on passing, he does it on screening. He's a tremendous player and not hard to coach him. When he has the ability to affect the game in different ways, we're a different team. But it takes everybody to do it. That should answer everyone's question."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The emphasis and where he's grown over the last two years is to take what the defenses give him and learn to impact the game in many different ways. Because of the type of team that we've had, especially this year, he's seen a bunch of different coverages and he's seen different matchups because teams have to match up with him. So coming into a game, it's kind of similar to a puzzle and he's done a great job learning how to solve the puzzle and do different things. Tonight, with the way that they were rotating and the way that they were defending, the most important thing was making the right play at the rim. We were able to stay out of transition because our guys made that. So I thought he did a tremendous job doing what the game called for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, you got to take a look at -- we gave up a 26-point first quarter and then three 25-point quarters. In the 26-point first quarter, we messed up the two for one and fouled a three-point shooter for three free throws. Luka gets two shooting free throws, we give up a transition basket to P.J. Washington, P.J. Washington hits an above-the-break three. That's almost 70 percent of the points there. So, like, the game was going the way we wanted it to go outside of the things that we can control. I thought our guys took the poise and remained in the mindset and the toughness to understand that. And then Jrue, it's connected and that's what people don't realize, is like every guy on our team can't be at their best if this guy doesn't do that. So Jayson's facilitating, Jaylen's decision-making. That leads to Jrue's playmaking, and the way that they're defending us, we have to make multiple plays. We have to have multiple drives. I think Jrue did a great job -- guys did a great job finding him, he did a great job attacking closeouts and then either kicking it back out for a second drive or getting an open shot. And then what he can do defensively. It just goes back to everybody on the team works to impact the game differently every single night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,That was sick.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it just comes back to he's not defined by one thing. He's just a little bit of everything. He can handle a pick-and-roll, he can score in pick-and-roll, he can stay spaced. He's not defined by scoring. He rebounds, he plays defense, he can play pick-and-roll, ball handling, the pick-and-roll screener. He's had blocks on bigs. So he's just another guy that's selfless and wants to impact the game in any way that he can, and it looks different every night. I think the thing about him is the confidence that he has to maybe go some possessions or a half or -- because teams are guarding us differently, his frequency can be impacted because of that at times. But he just fights to impact the game in different ways."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, the most important thing is getting a good shot and not turning it over. So in the first half, even though miss and our points per shot was much higher than theirs, I liked every shot that we took. That's the most important thing, is take what the defense gives you, whether it's a layup or three. The second piece to that was our offensive rebounding. So I think we had an offensive rebounding rate in the first half of, like, 41 percent, and it died down in the second half. But when you're not shooting it well, you still want to make the right plays so that it doesn't impact the other end of the floor. But you have to have the offensive rebounding capacity to get extra possessions, and I thought we did a really good job of that in the first half and hit some timely ones in the second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, he's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"He has the humility and selflessness to not care if he misses it. He practices it and has an understanding of how a shot like that can impact the end of a quarter and it can impact the run that a team makes. So they had went on a run to end the quarter, and I thought that shot kind of gave us a little bit of poise and a little bit of momentum that we needed heading into the fourth quarter. That was big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah. Yeah. He takes pride in that, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, because you have to look at the other side of the coin. If you get away from the discipline and doing what you do in those situations, it's going lead to other things, and it goes to the trust that the guys have in each other. So as long as you're taking great shots, you have to trust the process. On the back end of that, you got to have your offensive rebounding rate to help you. When things aren't going that way, you have to keep them off the free-throw line, which we didn't do a great job of, but we had three 25-point quarters. So usually what happens is you have those empty possessions on the offensive end, your defense starts to weigh in or you start to mistrust the discipline of your spacing and your shot selection, and you end you giving transition and getting cross-matched. So the guys trusted and stayed discipline and we were able to stay out of cross-matches and we were able to kind of keep the game in the way we wanted to play it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,My interpretation? It looked like a foul. But it wasn't called. So it wasn't a foul.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, just trying to keep -- Boston is a team that can run off threes in a hurry. Just trying to keep that from happening. Also, looking at just trying to give my guys some rest because they were fighting extremely hard. We are playing uphill, and so the lead went from 6 to 12, but then we responded after that second timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Big. The small things, you know, we have to do the small things, and that's part of the game. Those are points that we left on the board, and we didn't shoot free throws well tonight, and we have to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,He had great looks. They just didn't go down. That's just the game of basketball. Sometimes you make them. Sometimes you don't. You continue to keep playing. He had some good looks that just didn't go down for him tonight.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he was great. No matter what he says, that's just who he is. He's a leader. It's not all on him. It's a team. We win as a team, and we lose as a team. So he put us in a position. He was really good tonight. Unfortunately, we just couldn't get over the hump. I thought our defense was really, really good. We've just got to take care of the ball. There's too many turnovers that gave them points, and then also being able to -- we've got to score the ball, and right now, we've got to find someone to join Luka and Ky in that scoring category."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think Luka is a special player. He's one of, if not the best player in the world, and he causes a problem. He's able to find guys. Again, creating open opportunities, and we just didn't take advantage of it. And we'll go back and look and see if we can get even better looks. But the looks that we got, we just missed some open threes. It was good to see Exum knock down an open three, and hopefully we can build on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we do have quite a few young players. And for them to have fun and enjoy this, and learn from it, and that's what they are doing. And we've counted on them all year, not just here in the Finals, but throughout the season and also in the Western Conference Finals or the playoffs with Oklahoma City or the Clippers. And for them, it's just a matter of getting comfortable and going back home. Hopefully that will help."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We've just got to stay positive. Some of us have been in this situation before, and so just take one possession at a time, and we've got to focus on Game 3, and that's all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they haven't lost a game since May something, right? Yeah, they're hot. And not just on the road, but at home. We've got to protect home, and that's it. We've got to find a way, continue, again, to build on our defense. Our defense put us in a position to win tonight. Unfortunately, our offense didn't help us. And so, again, Ky and Luka are going to get their looks. We have got to get someone else involved of being able to knock down some shots. Defensively, we can build on this and we can be better. We've got to take care of the ball. If we can take care of the ball, hopefully that gives us more opportunities at scoring."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, well, I think it's a matter of not just playing one-on-one but setting -- setting it up so that they can get a live ball catch and be able to work. With Luka there for a minute, he was playing below the defense, and we were able to get him on the box or at the nail, and he took full advantage of that. Just being able to move the pieces around. And I thought we did that. We've got to take care of the ball. I've said this I sound like I'm repeating myself. But if we can take care of the ball and not give them live-ball turnovers where they are not just laying up the ball or dunking, it puts us in a better seat. We've got to take care of the ball. That's the next step in the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we are not down. We're positive. This is a group that believes. We didn't get an opportunity to get a split or win two here on the road. Now Boston held serve. Now we've got to go home and hold serve."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Luka's questionable. So, we'll see how he feels when he warms up and make that decision."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,I think taking a charge or diving on the floor for a loose ball.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yes, just one game plan. If he's out, we're prepared to go without him, next man up. If he's going, the game plan doesn't change. He's in. We've been in this seat pretty much the whole playoffs. So nothing changes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought yesterday was a great day for us on the floor, and then also watching the game. And then I think for our group, who has been around, we tend to be loose, and I thought yesterday was a perfect example of us getting better and understanding what we have to do tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at Ky, he's a vet. He's been on this stage multiple times. But he's played the game where he wasn't effective offensively, or up to his standards, and he will take a look at what he can do better. Again, understands what he has to do tonight. Hopefully we get those same shots. We truly believe that he'll knock them down, and hopefully that puts us in a position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Maxi is doing great. He feels great. Hopefully we can find some more minutes for him tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think as a player, I mean, it's different. But as a coach, there's a lot of waiting when it's spread out. So you've got to be able to pace the information that you're giving to guys. Don't want to overload them too early. You have to understand that with the break in between, the off-days or the days that you're not going on the court, but they are getting stimulated to still understand they have a job to do that's as a coach. As a player, you're just trying to figure out how to put yourself in a better position if you did lose, if you did win, you're anticipating the adjustments, what the team is going to do to try to slow you down. So two totally different things. Again, one is -- also involves the physical activity. The other one has you standing or sitting. So definitely different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, we beat ourselves a little bit tonight just on our turnovers and just some of our defensive rotations. They got a lot of opportunities, second-chance opportunities, where they got an opportunity to go into the fast break and just create just mismatches in transition. Look at some of the positives for sure where we won the first and fourth. But at the end of the day, we've got to win all four quarters if we want a great chance against this team. And we have to make sure that we create enough separation where we can play comfortably, too, and freely. So we had a good pulse about the game, I believe, going up until halftime. And then afterwards, you know, they did what other great teams do, you know, where they put their foot on the gas pedal, started pushing a little bit more, penetrating down the lane a little bit more and creating some opportunities at the free throw line. And they converted tonight, 19-for-20. So you've got to give them credit. They definitely picked up their defensive pressure, but finally we got some great looks as well. It's definitely a great test for us. They did what they had to do. They won both games at home, and now it's our job to go home and win both games at home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"You want to take advantage of playing in front of your home crowd, feeling confident and being able to play in a familiar place. And like I said, they handled what they were supposed to do, first two games, and now it's our job to go home and handle our business. But you've got to give them credit. They kept competing. We kept competing. We've just got to stay together in some of the tough times throughout the game where it could be a four-point lead on them or four-point lead that we have. We just have to keep competing, and I think we'll be in a better place. But feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's the confidence that I have in myself. A lot of shots were hitting the back rim. That could piss you off as a competitor, but it's all part of the game of basketball. And you have to accept the ups and downs of this. That's, I would say, the toughest challenge when you're in a series. You want to play extremely well, especially when you're playing in a Finals. A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well. It wasn't all on me, but I'm definitely taking the majority of it because my teammates look to me to convert a lot of these shots and ease the burden of not just Luka but everyone else and settle our team. We definitely made our dinner on the defensive end, but now offensively I have to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"We talked about this last series, he did something similar. But when you're in the Finals and you're taking the brunt of the accountability, he definitely -- he's in the right for wanting to single himself out. But this is a team game. He's not alone, and we are going to tell him that. As expected, he's fresh off the court. He's spilling into his emotions, feels like he could play better, just like me. I would take the brunt of the responsibility. The first two games weren't the best for me, especially him scoring 25-plus the points, getting rebounds, getting assists, doing the intangibles, and for me I've always felt responsible for getting other guys comfortable out there, too. It's on all of us. I'm pretty sure if you hear what everybody has to say, they will say that they can do something better. But I think the message right now is just get our bearings together. We lost by seven points. We don't want to take the total number back home and say we are proud of that. We don't want to do that. We want to go home and be prepared to win games, and in order to do that, we have to be ready to defend this good Boston Celtics team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's just adjusting to the pace. They are playing a great style of basketball, a great brand of basketball where they are pushing in transition. Sometimes those opportunities don't come as often or as easy. They have guys backloaded. They have a lot of guys that are athletic and running back in transition. You saw when P.J. had an opportunity to cut it to five, you saw Derrick White contest him at the rim. You saw Derrick White over there again contesting against D-Lively, even though he got dunked on, he still came over there and contested. That's what they have been doing. They have a lot of pride on that end. And they are not going to be easy on us. So on the fastbreak component, we definitely can create more opportunities for ourselves when we are in Dallas and look forward to doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I just chalk that up to just being in Boston. You know, some of those shots, they go up in the air, and I remember last game Sam Hauser caught it in the corner, and I don't think he even brought the ball down. It was practically all net. They feel very confident here. They have been a great team all year. Look at their record, I don't know how many total games they have lost since the postseason started. But I don't think it's more than six or seven. So they have really made their identity here. They want to take care of home court. And now it's our job to go home and do the same. Being in the Finals before, down 0-2, I have a little experience in this. Didn't play particularly well in the first two games in that series, too, that I'm referring to in 2016. So now I'm just really leaning in on what I've experienced, what I've learned and some of the lessons I've been able to make sense of in how to come back in this series because it is going to be a possession-by-possession thing, and it is going to be the hardest thing that we've ever done. So I think we've got a great feel, a great experience here in Boston of what the Finals is like for our group. Now we go home and shake off the cobwebs a bit and prepare for another fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Very, very proud of our group. We understood that we had to protect home court. We knew they were going to come out and be more aggressive. We were able to withstand their runs and protect home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I feel like we are just very connected as a group. Were just out there trying to play hard and compete and make plays. Its just unbelievable, the will of these guys in this locker room."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, he was unbelievable. His effort defensively and everything he brings on that end. And then on offense, making reads, making the game easy, making the right decisions. Hes so poised and you can tell that he has been in these types of moments. Just very composed and just out there getting the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I thought Jayson was unbelievable. Just navigating everything, getting everybody involved, taking shots when he needed to, defensively being solid, rebounding the ball well. JT just doing it all. Were asking a lot from him and he continues to step up and answer the call for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"If I could say something before we jump in. I want to address the comment that was made yesterday. I feel like people kind of took that out of context. I've been hearing that I prefer JB over JT and that's not what that was. I like to praise my teammates. I like to praise my teammates when they're playing well, and I feel like that's what I did my best to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Again, I don't think I'm shredding the defense. I think it's moreso JT and JB. Especially tonight, JT was getting into the paint and being double-teamed and making the right plays out of it and just finding me. Just either being at the dunker spot or being in the corner. He has that vision as a playmaker, so I would give that to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Well, first, I fouled Kyrie and put him on the free-throw line and I got my third foul, so Payton came in for me. I didn't want to foul him, but I'm kind of glad that I did. The energy that Payton brings, him just having the balls to take that shot. He's done it so many times this year. Where he's had the courage to take it and he's knocked it has been huge for us. So it was definitely a confidence boost and really just boosted us for the rest of that game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think when you sacrifice together and you do something together, it brings you closer. I think being able to go through wins and losses and to build something, it means a lot. So when you go through things like that, I think it makes you closer and I think that that's what this team has done. From 1 to 15, somebody's sacrificed something. It's been great and the journey's been awesome, but at the end of the day, the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think just trying to get into space and trying to be in his vision. I know that sometimes when I drive and I might get stuck, I need somebody to drift with me or to kind of be in space and be in my vision. So I think for the most part, I just try to stay in front of him, give him a good outlet. He's been making great reads."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, when I first got traded here, he was obviously one of the first people that I talked to, and I just think his positive nature. He's kind of this kind soul, somebody who has great energy about him. So every time that I talk to him and every time I see him, he's always been encouraging. This has been from the beginning. It's always nice to have somebody like that have your back and, again, somebody like that in your corner in your organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I'm a utility guy. I'll do whatever. I'm here to win. I feel like they brought me here to win, and I'll do my best to do that. But at the end of the day, this is their team. I know it's probably just as much my team as theirs, but again, I feel like I talked about this before, the pressure that they have on themselves to execute and to be great is a little bit different than my pressure. And, again, I've always been honest about that and how they always handle themselves has been something that's been so honorable. So it's just, it's slightly different. They're superstars and I'm here to support."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, well, that one we were actually down 2-0, that was slightly different, but --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"And that's, and that's all I remember, too. So I think it's a little different that -- again, a different team, different setting, different year, definitely having COVID year, it was a bit weird. I think being on this team, the journey to this point has been, great, but we still know being up 2-0 means nothing. Job's not done. We have to do whatever it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I would say maybe I'm a bit more comfortable. Just knowing kind of the pressure and the atmosphere and obviously what's on the line, this is a bit different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, in huddles like that, it's intimate, and it's something that we kind of hold close and dear to ourselves. I think in times like that, encouraging each other, being able to police ourselves in times like that when we might be doing something that is uncharacteristic. Or even if we're doing something great, all those things are brought up in those moments to where we can really just go out there and do our best to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, I love my teammates. They have been here before. They have been here before and they know what it takes to get to this point. They have shown it. You've seen them in the Eastern Conference Finals and you've seen them in the Finals before. We're all determined as a team. We all want this and it's something that, it's collective. I won't say that I do much or I talk much. I feel like I'm more of an action type of guy. I go out there and I play as hard as I can and do whatever the team needs for us to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's natural. I think that they had chemistry and some things I had to figure out. But that just goes to show how great of teammates I have. There's been times where I've struggled kind of figuring out my place or what I need to do to help the team win, and Derrick has been the person who has talked me through it. I've been point guards on other teams and I've been shooting guards on other teams. But Derrick is our point guard, and he's shown that the whole season. I would say that there are different times in the season where each guy's kind of come and talked to me about how they felt and how they saw the game and what I could do to help and all that. That's helped me out tremendously getting to this point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Stay consistent on defense. Our communication is always tested when it comes to games like this because of how much they want to play on the perimeter. We have to make sure we get those guys inside the line and make sure our rotations are top-tier.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just got to play to the physicality. At the end of the day, you know, they are pushing us around. We've got to be able to do the same thing. That's kind of like what the message was when we came out the second half Set the tone physically."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Having poise offensively and making sure we get the right guys downhill. Well, pretty much any guy downhill to be honest with you. We've got a lot of guys that can drive to the basket and score the ball that gravitate a lot of attention from anybody that's the low man. So we just have to make sure as bigs, me and D-Lively, make sure we get the guys downhill to where they can get a shot off, or we get a rebound if they miss it, or just throw the lob over the top."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure we are focusing on the positive things at the end of the day. I know Luka said it was a lot on him when it came down to it. It's a team it's a team game. You know we can't have one person taking the blame for everything because you know we all have faults in certain areas on the floor and we make up for that trying to just really continuing to play through this as adversity, any obstacle that we face, we always have to play through that as a team. So he missed free throws I missed free throws. There's a lot of guys that missed free throws tonight, and that hurt us. So it's not just on him. Not on Kyrie. It's a team thing, and we just have to come out with the same mindset that we had tonight and try to win all four quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, this is the biggest stage in the NBA. Everybody wants to be here at the end of the season. So we just have to come prepared, shake off the nerves, get the butterflies out. It's going to be crazy atmosphere, crazy energy. It's the NBA Finals. Everybody wants to be in this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,For sure. They got their crowd into it when we came here and they did their job when it came to protecting home court and we have to do the same thing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just focus on the positives. At the end of the day, we just find ways to just make adjustments to what we kind of lacked in certain areas, most definitely. Watch film, learn from it and be ready for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"No, I don't think so. I feel like they just made plays at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Our poise. Be comfortable in the situation. Embrace the atmosphere and really embrace whatever's going to be thrown at us. This is a great team that we are playing against, and they are going to throw everything they can at us to just rattle us in any given circumstance. So we just have to take our time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, I actually was -- you know, I always want to play. So all day we did a lot of things to get ready for the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Good. Good. I was okay.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I'm sorry, I don't know who is the Celtics owner."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Every game we lose, it's a missed opportunity for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, obviously didn't work because we lost. But at the end of the day, we've got to make some more shots. I think my turnovers and my missed free throws cost us the game. So I've got to do way better in those two categories. But at the end of the day, we've got to make shots to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"That's why they are the No. 1 team in the NBA with the No. 1 record. They have a lot of great players. Basically anybody can get off. Honestly, I think we didn't do a bad job defending today. We took away threes. We contested more threes. And like I say, I had too many turnovers, and we missed a lot of free throws. So I think that cost us the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they are physical, yeah. But they try to guard one-on-one. I think today they tried to help more. I was able to get some teammates open. But they are physical. They are very physical. We let them be physical. So they are pretty, pretty amazing on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,I think it was a charge. We don't really know because I didn't feel it until the next day. I was really surprised. So we think it was a charge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,We've got to make shots. We've got to make free throws and less turnovers. Those three things I think are the key for a win -- to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Score more points. But at the end of the day, it's basketball, away or home. We've just got to play better basketball to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Sorry, I don't understand you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yes -- I don't really know how to respond, but yes. I'm sorry."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was great. In moments where we gained some momentum, that helped us get over the hump. So tonight we came out, we didn't shoot the ball well. We were a little flat, but I felt like the crowd helped us stay in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue has been an example of just excellence. Since he's been here, his role has been different from what it was the last few years on Milwaukee, and he's been able to adapt. Not a lot of guys can do that, be versatile, play different roles and different styles and still have an effect on the game. Jrue, he just came in, he wasn't on the ball as much, still guarded at a high level, but became a corner three-point specialist. That's just a testament to his greatness. Tonight they wanted to emphasize loading up, making us make the right reads over and over again, and Jrue had a lot of opportunities tonight and he took advantage. He's just a hell of a player, hell of a person, great teammate. I credit the victory to him tonight. He played well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, we got a lot of weapons on our team, so we just got to trust what we've been doing all season long, trust our game plan. We didn't hit shots tonight. I thought we had a bunch of great looks. If you go back and look in the first half, Sam had a bunch of great looks, D-White had some look that didn't go down. But we didn't panic. We kept guarding, we stayed in the game and we kept trusting it and we made enough tonight to win the game. But we expect to shoot the ball better going forward when we get on the road."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Derrick is -- he's been, you know, All-Defensive all season long. In that moment right there, we make a tough rim read. Rim reads lead to transition, so we want to manage that a little bit better. But it's the playoffs, you got to just get back and make a play. Derrick White sprints back. I see they have an advantage. I sprint back and was able to make a play there. But those are the type of plays that help you win games. It's just effort, that's what it comes down to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue is a great teammate, nothing short of that. He's brought championship pedigree to our team. So nothing Jrue says we question. Jrue, he comes in and he just is who he is. He's got that demeanor, that killer-like mentality, and we respect it. You know what I mean? He's a great teammate and it's just an honor to play next to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments. But it's just an example of what we do and have been doing all season long. How you finish quarters is big. We didn't finish that quarter great. We got a lot of open looks, we gave up some. There was some bad fouls. One of them was mine. I fouled Luka on the back cut, and then me and JT got mixed communication on the switch. Luka had a three. We got to finish quarters better. But Payton checks himself in the game and covers us a little bit by hitting the big-time shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. That's the majority of what the battle is, just managing your emotions. How do you handle adversity and your will and your perseverance. Everything isn't going to go according to plan. I wouldn't have hoped that we shot, I don't even know, what, 7-23 from three? We had a few ill-advised turnovers and fouls, but effort makes up the difference. Your mindset, we play -- I think we played harder than them tonight, and I think that's just going to be the key. If we want to win, we just got to be the harder-playing team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. Just trying to wear on those guys, be as physical as we possibly can, full team effort. Just keep touching them. That's it. I think that those guys are tremendously gifted offensively. They came out swinging. Luka came out in the first quarter, we knew what he was going to do. We knew he was going to be aggressive. But we just stayed with the game plan. We stayed just consistent and we was able to turn him over a few times that helped us push the lead out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, that's just being patient. You got a lot of energy, excitedness, nerves, when the game starts, but sometimes you just got to be patient. And I got to the paint pretty much whenever I wanted, and I could be patient when I get there. I had a few turnovers where I had a little bit more time to wait for the defender to make a choice, because those two-on-one reads are there, where you get to the paint, the defender is, the big is coming, you either kick it to the corner or if he drives down to the corner you kick it to the wing. But don't got to be in a rush. Just protect the ball, make the great decisions and trust your teammates. I think that's what the majority of this is. We did that enough tonight, but I think we need to do it a little more going into Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We expect them to play better. They have showed that all postseason. I think they have lost Game 1 a couple times, and they came back with a big Game 2 win. So we expect them to play a lot better. We've got to be even better than we were last game and just try to clean up the things we made mistakes on and understand it's definitely going to be a bigger challenge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,I feel like always the No. 1 adjustment is to play harder. Play with more physicality. We can't be satisfied. We've got to understand that. We've been talking about that the whole postseason. It's just physicality. So we've got to be ready for whatever they throw at us.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Each game just gets more and more difficult. The more comfortable you get with the team, the more you know what they like to do, what we like to do. Each game just gets more and more difficult. Each game is a different adjustment, and you've just got to figure out what they change and how we can attack that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it feels way different. I think anytime you make it for the first time, this is just like a dream come true. And it's just a lot going on, obviously. So this year, I'm not surprised by it, just comfortable and ready to compete."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think any experience is great to have. Obviously, it was a different series, different time, different team. But all experience is nice. We've learned a lot from that. I think we've grown from it. Whatever it takes to win, and whatever it takes to advance, that's what we've been doing this whole postseason. So whatever it takes. We win, we lose, but we got to be ready to compete at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"First things first, you've got to compete. Just try to make them uncomfortable. Obviously, two great players. They kind of play a little differently, but two great players. Just try to keep them in front and try to have them take tough shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I love Joe. Love playing for him. He's a great basketball mind. The way he thinks is next level. I think this year he's just much more comfortable, and we all feel comfortable with him as our coach. It's been great just learning from him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I give Drew a lot of credit for my development in helping me get to where I'm at. I started working with Drew when I was in eighth grade and every offseason since then, we've worked out together. That's like family. I've said it a million times that, you know, Drew is a big reason in helping me get to where I'm at, and you know, I'm very thankful for everybody that played a part in helping me, you know, reach my goal and continue to strive in this space that I'm in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That, you know, far from over, it's an extremely long series and not get too excited or get too down about a win or a loss. Don't feel like that the series is over and that we had it won because of the last game. And if you lose a game, right, we talk about it all the time that it's going to take however long it takes. If that's four, five, six, seven, whatever, we are trying to just take it one game at a time and not skip any steps, whatever we've got to do to win. That's what we have to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It's just about reading the game. Draw so much attention, you know, when I have the ball in my hands, and you know, it's about creating an advantage. We always talk about that, watching film, creating advantage, finding the mismatch that we want, and it might not always end up in the shot for you. Or if you set a screen and get a smaller guy on you, just having that mismatch and calling for the ball, right, it may draw other defenders to help, and we can pin in for somebody else to get a shot. You know, those things won't show up in the stats sheet, but it's part of our execution, and sometimes you have to make a sacrificial cut or things like that to generate good shoots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I mean, it's a lot that goes into that, right. Time of the game. Time to score. Who is in the game with me. All those things play a part. A lot of times, if you can generate shots for other people and make the defense have to respect those guys, it eventually opens a lot of other things up for you later in the game that you can take advantage of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"No reaction. This is a team sport, right. We understand that. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have JB on our team, and we can say that for a lot of guys, right. We have all played a part in getting to where we're at, and we understand that people try to drive a wedge between us. I guess it's a smart thing to do or try to do. We've been in this position for many of years of guys trying to divide us and say that one of us should be traded or one is better than the other. So it's not our first time at rodeo."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"They really just kind of test your discipline. They test, are you going to make the right play over and over and over again. Even if it's not resulting in you getting the shots or you scoring all the points. But you know, you're constantly scoring at a high rate. We are up 20 at halftime. They are trying to test if human nature is going to play a part of wanting to get yourself going. Instead of doing all the things that is making the game easier for the team, you know, you just have to stay committed to doing what's right and making the right play until they adjust their defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Whoevers open. Laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we understand that. I feel like we're going to get -- I don't want to say their best shot, but you know, we understand that they are going to play a lot better, and we have to be prepared for that. Not let it catch us off guard or, you know, wait till the second quarter if we are down to lock in. Understanding from the jump that they are going to come out and play faster. They are going to shoot more threes. They are going to play harder. So I think knowing that coming into the game is the first step. And then, you know, focusing on what we need to do. There's a lot of things that we watch in film that honestly we feel like we could be a lot better at. All in all, we feel like tomorrow should be really fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we've had conversations about it before. In all reality, we've just had to deal with it for a very long time. I think it's part of us maturing as men, right. Very, very young coming into this league, and just had to deal with all the ups and downs of, essentially, the success that we've had. There's been positive things and there's been negative things that come with that. We are not the first duo to go through that process, and we won't be the last. So understanding that side of it, and just keeping the main thing the main thing, and focusing on the job that we have front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think, like I said, just over time, you learn how to deal with things. There was a point, right, in my career where things did affect me or would bother me that, you know, to hear people talk about me on TV. But you just have to come to a realization that, for one, don't take it personal. People have a job to do. You have to respect that. They have to go on TV and give their analysis of, you know, things that they see and watch, and that's fair. You understand what the media side has done for the game of basketball and how we have all benefited from that. Again, people wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't one of the best players. I'm not the only player that they have ever talked about, and I won't be the last. So understanding that side of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I was in my hometown of West Linn. I believe I was in West Linn. Maybe I was in Oregon City. But, yeah, I was back home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just remember KG, after he won, doing the interview after where he was shouting out to his kids and stuff like that, going crazy."

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Playing sports, baseball, basketball, running around. Big into sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Not until high school. It's when I transitioned to just hoop.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Always basketball. I liked it all equally. Baseball and football.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They said that? I don't know if I'm superstitious. Maybe I'm like superstitious like if I have a bad shooting game, I probably won't wear those shoes again. That's about it. Like something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,This feels similar. We've been through it before. So we're used to a lot of things coming. So we know we've got to be ready for Game 2 and try to take care of business.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player so you have to be prepared for a lot of things. You have to play hard, make things tough and hope he misses."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He draws so much attention. So even if he's not shooting the ball well, he can draw a lot of attention. Defenses are collapsing on him. Creates easy shots for teammates even when he doesn't have the ball. He's very impactful, always."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's really relaxed. Quiet. A little bit reserved. Great dude. Easy to be around. Yeah, he's just easygoing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's hard for me to say because I know him. So I know he's one of the best players. But like the way his personality is, he's just laid back. So he's not, like, showboating and acting like he's the best. He's confident but -- I think he's confident knowing who he is so he doesn't feel the need to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I feel pretty good. Yeah. Feel good. Not much more to add. Preparing my body for tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Obviously as I said postgame, it was like a relief, being back on the court, healthy, winning games, starting off the series the right way. It was definitely a relief. But yeah, it's like a lot more work to be done and yeah, tomorrow we get another chance on our home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's huge. It's huge, obviously. But yeah, to be honest, the way I moved, looking back now at the game, and I dont think I even expected myself to be able to be moving so well. That was, again, a good sign for myself and now having two days in between and preparing my body again, getting even probably better conditioning now for next game will be huge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, good, like, how do you say, description of a little bit, especially preparing myself all regular season for the playoffs and round one, something unfortunate happens and staying mentally put and staying in the right place to have the chance to come back later in the playoffs and of course I wanted to come back earlier but it didn't work out that way. But here I am now and healthy and able to put on a good game for my first game back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It was insane. I'm not going to lie. Just walking in the tunnel was like a WWE style walk-in. I didn't even know it was for me at first walking out, hearing that crowd roar and getting real excitement to start the game and give everything to these fans that came."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,We were joking in the back that I should do that next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think that goes unnoticed a lot of times and what goes unnoticed is he doesn't get the credit a lot of times and he's the first one to get all the blame if he doesn't have a monster game. It's a little bit unfair to him. But hats off to him for taking it on the chin and conducting himself as a champion and being like, I'll do whatever it takes for this team to win. Of course, he's always the focal point for the other team and JB and then maybe, I don't know, I'm third, fourth, fifth, sixth on the list. That takes a lot of pressure off me. I can have a lot more open looks, a lot more, like, good situations for me. That's credit to JB and JT but especially JT."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The balance is having proper spacing. Making the right play. I thought we did a good job of fighting for our spacing, making the right two-on-one reads. That's more important than anything else. And so I think regardless of who we are trying to attack, making sure we are at the proper spacing and making sure we are making the right play based on where the two-on-one read is is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great person. He's a great coach. Just humility, joy, work ethic, intensity that he brings. And, you know, we've grown to have a great relationship. So I'm very grateful for him, and I'd like to think that we make each other better. So it's great that he was here. It's great that he was able to share some of his wisdom and got to spend time with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, when I talked with him in the process of deciding if he wanted to come here, I said the thing about our team is we need everybody and we are going to play guys. You don't get to where we are at right now and win a lot of games unless you have great depth. And throughout the season, because it's such a long season, what those guys do kind of gets lost in the shuffle. But there was moments where he helped win us games, second night, back-to-back, four in five, whatever it is, NeeNee Neemias Queta and those guys starting. So their ability to just stay locked in and stay professional and impact winning is very important, and so that was what I told him before he came here, and him, the other guys and the player development staff do a great job of just staying on top of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just need to focus on the truth. At the end of the day, nobody knows because they are not in the locker room. And so I think as long as we focus on the truth, we focus on the things that we talk about every day, we focus on the relationships that we build with each other, we focus on just that stuff. They can look at it however they want. At the end of the day, what goes on in our locker room, how we communicate with each other, how we build relationships with each other and how we treat each other on and off the floor, that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I wonder how many of those have been Christian coaches.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, spacing is, like, ages old. It's the most important thing. I think you've seen different spacings based on how the game has changed and how the game has evolved and how your roster evolves and how -- I think the better offenses have gotten, the more creative defenses have gotten, and the ability to put guys in certain spots, protecting the rim, where are your best individual defenders. So being valuable in your spacing I think is the most important thing because you have an understanding of who is where, and you have an understanding of where the advantages are. And so it's one of those things that you have to fight for. It's a simple detail that, if you don't talk about a lot, it can get overlooked. But your spacing can manipulate the type of shots that you get and the decisions that you make, and I think that's the fight. Dallas's defense, they are one of the smartest, best defensive teams in the league, and they have the ability to manipulate your spacing with their rotations and with their personnel, and so we've got to be just as creative and just as disciplined in our spacing to make sure that we can counteract that. That's kind of what Pep has helped me with, spacing. Very important in transitions how you move those guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think as you get into this, you start to realize, once you're in a position, nobody can really relate to you other than people in those positions. So you develop a bond with other coaches and you know what they are going through and you know what the challenges are and the opportunities and the situation you're in. So I think it's really important that we all stick together, me, him, Coach Jim Montgomery, Alex Cora. You just have to stick together and help each other through it because each of our four coaches have been through it, whether it's inside Boston or outside Boston. Jerod and I got close as assistants, just how would you do things when it's your opportunity, what have you learned from the head coaches that you've worked for. And now that we are in this position, it's helping each other with the transition and the different experiences."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The most important thing for guys like Sam and Payton is having an understanding we would not be here without those guys. They have literally won games for us. And you're not defined by scoring. That's one of the strengths of this team top to bottom, whether it's the starters, role guys, not one guy strives to be defined by one thing. So getting two stops on defense, being in the right spot, getting two rebounds, getting to the free throw line, sprinting to manipulate the spacing to get an open shot. All those things count for the same, especially at this time of year. And Sam has done a great job in his career of not being defined as a shooter, of being able to do other things. And our team has taken that on, and we have to work to stay to be that well-rounded on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just making sure we make them uncomfortable from the jump. I feel like Game 1 we eased into the game when we shouldn't have. We should have came out and threw the first punch instead of taking the first punch. They are a great-shooting team, and we just have to be able to get them off their spots and force them into our defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY,"Adapt. Learn. As I said before, if we are the same person we were yesterday, then we aren't getting better. Everybody here wants to the right thing and everything we can possibly do to win. That's what everybody on the team needs to do so we can get a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It's playing our game of basketball and not going into the game that they want us to play. Playing our game of pick-and-roll. Getting out in pace, getting in space and making them overhelp so we can get open shots and we can get people open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like it's definitely big plays, whether it's a dunk or three ball. As long as our team is together, we are cheering, yelling, connected, it definitely makes other teams question what they are going to do or question their schemes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Our footwork. Our placing of knowing where our positioning is on the defensive side, no matter if it's setting them down, us being low, not being late on coverages and calling out coverages early so they can't get easy pick-and-pop threes. It's been a lot of fail and learn, fail and get a little bit better. We are not going to get better at all if we don't learn from our mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We have to get up into them. We can't let him just post up, get the ball at the top of the key and just lace it down because he is going to shoot over the top. It's going to be trying to make sure that we get him off of his stops. Get him one or two feet away from his normal spots so he's a little more uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"All he says is keep your head down and stick to the grind. There's not a lot of things he can do all the way back in Dallas. All he's telling me to do is the little things, whether that's hitting them on the box-out or being able to talk to my teammates on the back side. Just doing the little things so that everybody is connected on the court so that we are not leaving everybody behind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"For sure. I feel like everybody in the first half, everybody is thinking, they can shoot, they can shoot. Whenever we can come out and show that we can defend, we can get them off the three-point line, then it's a different game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY,I feel like it's not panic. It's more urgency of getting the job done.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think we've just got to overall be on a better page together, offense and defense. We gave up way too many rhythm threes for them. They have a very capable three-shooting team. On the offensive side, just finding our spots better, creating the space for Ky and Luka to operate and make the right plays. Overall, finding our spots, communication and play better together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,We believe in each other. We just try to play hard. We saw the mistakes. We watched the tape. So we just have to make the right adjustment and come out with the right energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,We have got to make it a little bit harder on him to get the catches on the elbow. Push out a little bit further and then just stay in front of him and make sure we contest a shot the best way possible. We definitely can't let him get into rhythm early.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think we dealt with good crowds in Game 1s before. I feel like OKC and Minnesota were very loud, too. Obviously, this is the Finals and it's the biggest stage. But at the end of the day, we have to focus on our game and play with the right mindset. I wouldn't say it's a big change for us. We just have to, like I said, focus and do a better job on what we're supposed to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Of course. We have been together for so long now. We had some trades at the trade deadline. But it gives you time to just spend more time together, play more together. The deeper you get into the playoffs, the bond is growing. Even yesterday in the meeting, just the way we communicated and figure out solutions for the problems, it's just showing that we can grow every day as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think there's a big, big gap between Dirk Nowitzki and me. He's one of the greatest ever, so I would never, ever dare to compare myself to him. I also think the role that he had and the playoff run that they had back then was so outstanding and one of the most underrated runs -- not underrated but crazy underdog runs. For me, it's an honor to be here, to fight with the team for the championship. I don't take it for granted. Just come out here and play my hardest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought we were too much one-on-one. We've got to move bodies. We've got to move the ball. Multiple guys have to touch the ball. We were just too stagnant, and that's not the way we play. We've got to be better tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Unfortunately, we are not playing. I don't know how to answer that question. I'm taller. I would post him up, but he would probably be more physical. He's one of the best coaches in this league. He's gotten his team to the Finals. They play at a high rate. He understands his group. So when you talk about Joe, he's done an incredible job. And it's not easy, especially when you're favored or supposed to be somewhere. It puts a little bit more pressure. But I think he's handled it well. His group plays at a high level. His group plays hard. He's one of the best coaches in the league. For that, we have our work cut out as a coaching staff. We've got to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"He got great looks. Unfortunately, our two quarterbacks had turnovers that normally don't happen. Give credit to Boston. But we believe that the shots that he got in Game 1 were great looks that just didn't go down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think there's no panic with this group. We didn't play well in Game 1. Give credit to Boston they did. But it's a series and we don't just look to capitalize on just one game. We've lost Game 1 a lot of times, and we've responded. We believe that we can respond in Game 2. We just try to take it one game at a time. We didn't have a really good first quarter there at the end. Put us down. But the guys kept fighting. We found a way to get it to eight. It was very similar to the way the playoffs started for us with the Clippers. We didn't play well. We cut that 30-point lead down and made a game of it. But we responded in Game 2 on the road. Hopefully we can do the same thing here in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Jayson, he's one of the best offensive players in this league. Understanding that he puts a lot of pressure behind the three, behind the line, and then also being able to get to the rim. He's not one that just settles. We have to, again, try to keep him from getting to the rim, keeping him off the free throw and then giving him wide-open threes. And so that's not easy. It's easier said than done. Again, we just have to make it tough on him. On the defensive end, he uses his length. He's strong. He's not one to give in. We've got to find other ways to score."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we knew that he was going to play, and he played well. He played well coming off the bench. He's played well starting, or as he showed, coming off the bench. We've got to make it tougher on him. When he starts to get going, he can shoot it from halfcourt with range. We have to be able to take some of those threes away. On the other end, we have to make him work. But we also got to account for -- when you go to the basket, he's going to be there. You have to account that he's got a good chance of blocking the shots. We have to take advantage of his overhelp at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we happened to play the same position, some are a little bit better than others. But when you look at the things this we have to do just in this series better, we've got to take care of the ball, we've got to make it easier for Ky and Luka. Being able to put those guys in different spots on the floor so there's a little bit stress-free so they can do what they do at a high level. We just didn't do that in Game 1. But it's really simple conversation when you talk about things that we have to do not just on the offensive end but the defensive end. Ky and Luka take responsibility for that. Our conversations are really simple and to the point. When you talk about the high IQ, you don't have to sit there and paint the picture. You can just get right to it. They understand from my side what I'm asking them to do, and when they respond I understand what their responses are and what they are talking about and what they see. It's worked at an extremely high level for when we do talk in-game or on a day like today of what we are trying to get to. Those guys trust what I see or what I'm telling them, and I trust their response."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think just understanding this group, it's not about screaming or yelling. It's about what we do best, and when we are having fun and smiling is when we are at our best. I just felt there at the end of the first, we just weren't at our best. It was talked about and it's going to happen. It might happen in Game 2. But the response from our group has to be quicker and it has to be better. Not where we're talking about we have to score the ball, but we have to get better on the defensive end, and that's being connected. We felt we lost a little connection there at the end of the first. But when we talked about it at halftime, it was a great response and we did play at a better level in that second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we'll make some adjustments. But Boston is going to give the layup to Luka, so he's got to take it. They're not going to give him the lob, and they are not going to give the corner three. So it's two-on-two, and we have to take advantage of that. We missed some layups. We missed some shots in the paint. That happens. But we believe that Ky and Luka will get into the paint and make them in Game 2. But it's no different than what we saw in Minnesota. Just understanding that Boston is a really good defense, and being able to bluff or take away something, we trust that Luka and Ky will pivot and do what's best, and that's take the layup or take the easy two and continue to wear out the paint and layups. But we've got to make those, too. Because on the other end if you don't make them and they come down and they make a couple threes, it puts a lot of pressure on your offense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, Jaylen is their best player. Just looking at what he does defensively, he picked up Luka full court. He got to the free throw line. He did everything, and that's what your best player does. Just understanding he plays both sides, defense and offense, at a high rate. And he's been doing that the whole playoffs. I mean, when talk about the Eastern Conference MVP, and it seems like he has continued to pick up where he left off. So he's playing at a high rate. We've just got to be a little more physical with him. And again, we have to keep him off the free throw line and out of the paint because, again, he was finishing at a high rate or he was getting fouled and getting to the free throw line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time. It's not the first time we've heard that Dallas fans are panicking. Shout-out to our fans. We appreciate your support all year. Just stay poised, man. Stay focused on the goal. This mission is bigger than us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"By doing your best not to pay attention to it because a lot of people don't know what they are talking about, and specifically if you've never played that position or been on a team at that level where you have to go through it yourself, and I know that we have people that appreciate the game of basketball that speak on it. But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that. I'm just here to play basketball. It's a dream come true to be at this level. I've had to work extremely hard. I've been a winner my whole entire life. I've obviously had some failures and loss but done a lot more winning. Used to it. In order to be on that type of frequency or that goal, you've got to be selfless in your approach. Obviously you're not going to get it right all the time, but as a teammate, you just want to push those other things to the side that don't really matter or get you better as a team. So we just leave it to everybody else to argue whose team it is and who has the most responsibility. It's all our jobs to be prepared. S----y conversation, but it has to happen in sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Just by paying attention to how we prepare and also just adjustments. Sticking to the game plan.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean it was our first time being together as a group in this Finals stage. Experience is the best teacher at times when you don't know what to expect. Going out there, TD Garden, playing against the Boston Celtics, who are having a historic season. We knew they were going to come out with a lot of verve, a lot of energy. And they have been doing it all year. They have been consistent on their end. I think it's pretty easy to say we can focus on our end and pay attention to what we can control. But it's a little bit deeper than that. Just got to calm our nerves, poise our nerves a little bit and just be aware of the environment we are in. It's going to be high intense from who we are going against. It's going to be very physical. Some things are going to be called and some things aren't. I think we got all that experience in Game 1, and we are looking forward to the challenge in Game 2 to play better and being who we have been since post-All-Star Break and just having fun in doing it. This is the highest level of basketball right now. We are the only two teams playing. We are proud of ourselves but we are not satisfied. We've just got to continue to be ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"He was reiterating the same things I'm saying, probably a little bit more simple. But he's been giving us a lot of peace of mind, especially when we are out there, high-intense environment, like I said. Just got to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"By realizing that I've been in this league for 13 years, and I've been playing against the Celtics for quite a few years and I have quite a few playoff series against them, whether wins or losses. So I just try to be aware that this is a new space that I'm in as one of the leaders of the team and with the new group, and giving them that peace of mind, like I said, when things get tough. We are going against a very historic team in the Boston Celtics, but we're a great team too. We have to remember that. And engaging with fans here in Boston is always fun. Like I said last week, it's something I'll turn the page over on, too, but people continue to ask me about it and what I think about it, which is cool, too. But yeah, this is what makes sports fun. This is what makes the stories fun. Getting a chance to go against a giant like this, whether it be just talking about the team or talking about the environment and the fans and how crazy it can get. This is what I imagine it being like, getting to this stage again, earning our way to be here with my teammates and being able to put our best foot forward going against the best of the best. That's everything you dream of. Everything else is extracurricular."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"No. Not really. Again, I've been able to grow over the past few years to put basketball in perspective. This is an incredible experience that I get to live out for quite a few years of my life. I'm going to learn a lot of lessons that I'm going to apply to life after this. I failed miserably while also not knowing how to compartmentalize or accept the emotions that come with failure, and also being on the successful side, didn't know how to handle that either. So the past few years have been about that growth perspective for me and learning how to handle myself in situations and circumstances that are going to be more beneficial for me to learn now than learning it when I'm 38 years old, and I'm looking back at my career, and I don't even know how to celebrate that. I don't expect to be celebrated by everybody. I'm going to, you know, still be aware that a lot of people want to see me fail. But again, I think I pay attention more to the way that I'm celebrated from people that love me unconditionally and I go home and have a peace of mind. You know, thinking about my time in Boston, I could go down a myriad of things that none of you in here know that I was dealing with, and I don't think a lot of people would care. I think a few people would care and want to hear about it, and I would leave that space open in the future if you ever want to hear about it. But putting into perspective the blowup dolls and remarks that are getting said, that's basketball. When I leave out of here and I walk around Boston, I don't hear a lot of the things that I hear when I'm playing on the court. There's a lot of mutual respect. There's a lot of eye-to-eye communication that's built on just being human, and they appreciate the things I do off the floor, as well. So there are a lot of Celtics fans out there that still love me, too, surprising to everybody. But when I'm on the street walking around, which I do, you know, it's a lot of love. I get a lot of embrace. I take pictures. My dad is here, he played at Boston University. So there has to be a respect there because if anything happens to my family while I'm here, then it goes way beyond the game, you know. And I don't forget things either. Somebody threw something at me while I was here. I've heard it all. Nobody asked me how I felt after that and why it could be a little bit of a traumatic response when I'm back in this environment after somebody does something like that. You know, so things have changed since then. I've been able to accept what I cannot change but also change the way that I look at things to be more positive. So this is fun for me, man. This is healthy. I'm glad that I can be up here on this stage speaking authentically and then also go home and be at peace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, teaching is fun. Being a student is even more fun. So when you're in a film session with J-Kidd or Coach Sean Sweeney or even Luka, myself, and the rest of our guys, there's a lot of honest communication going on. Just what we see. And we always make sure that we are aware that -- we're a new group in this environment, too. So give ourselves some grace and patience and be ready to play our best game every day and prepare. The things we see out there, we have to talk about it. Some of the cues that you would normally have when you make it to this level, we are still developing, and that's okay. So as we look to become an even better team, a greater team through this experience, this is what's needed is just that honest communication."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would start off with this. So, try not to get FOMO as best you can just because you're so used to playing every single day, working out every single day towards a goal, and now that that goal isn't necessarily there to win the Championship, you have to set other goals, and that comes from a personal standpoint. You know, what do you want to accomplish bringing into next season, it starts now while no one is watching and while it's just you by yourself or your brother or you're playing five-on-five. Just working on the things that everyone said that you were not great at or you could not do or that you see within yourself that you need to improve. Because you're seeing how hard it is to get here and how long you have to stay locked in, as you said. So I've been able to find some peace of mind throughout this journey, throughout this year, of just making this phrase, like our team bonding thing, like just peaking at the right time. Some teams peak really early, some teams peak in the middle of the season, and some teams start peaking at the end. Some teams get into the playoffs or get deep into the playoffs and they peak. It just depends where you are as a team and your understanding of what you're doing, and also appreciating all the hard work it took to get here. A lot of our peers are watching and trying to get back to where we are, get here. So we have to be aware that the hunger is going to be more next year, but we are also going to be hungry, too, to show why we are one of the best in the world. Two teams left. Dream come true as a kid to be in a Final, see the court change a little bit, see all the stickers, see the 600 media members and credentials we get. It can be a lot, but it's also something you want to appreciate because you never know when you're going to get back. Take your time, but also work your tail off right now because I know I'm going to have to get ready for you guys next season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"They're definitely a team that is going to come out swinging, much, much more aggressive. For us, to be able to come out with the same energy and continue to play at a high level like we've been doing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Every series is different. Every game is different. For us, we understand it's a big challenge. We are not really thinking about the past. We have to focus on this Game 2 and make sure we do the things we need to do to put ourselves in position to win a game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It presents its own challenges. And now obviously I know that they are going to come out very aggressive, and we are, as well. It's just one of those things that we have to make sure that we just stay the course. Emotions are obviously going to be high. From Game 1 to Game 2, the biggest thing is making sure we are as prepared as we can be and ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"DJ has been great for us. Very clear with his concepts what he wants to do. Creating how he wants us to execute things. I feel like our group, obviously weve bought in, were really locked in and trying to do the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"J-Kidd, man, I see what he is doing. I see what he is doing. Jaylen Brown is an unbelievable player and very special for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think we came out aggressive, which was good. Gave us some leeway to withstand their punch when they came back. I think we did a pretty good job executing for most of the game but keeping our poise, even being up almost 30 and then coming down, cutting it to eight. I think we kept our poise pretty well and pushed it back up to 20."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Something different. They are probably going to try to get more threes. I think their role players are going to make more of an impact, and then they are just going to come out more aggressive. It was Game 1. Its always a feeler game. I think when both teams get more comfortable out here, it will be a battle."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's Game 2 of the Finals. I think we are definitely expecting them to swing and come out clawing and fighting. We know in their Game 2s, Luka has started off, definitely been killer, especially, in the first quarter. I think at this point we have to lock into the game plan and do the best we can to kind of withstand their punches and go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we did the best we could trying to take away their lobs. Those are definitely energy plays for them. Two high flyers in Gafford and Lively, we tried to take those away. I think we tried to keep them on the free throw line as best possible, and we know they have corner shooters in Derrick Jones Jr. and P.J. Washington and Tim Hardaway Jr. They have a lot of great role players out there. So just really going to do the best we can to try to minimize it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think the relationship between Jayson and Jaylen is natural. I don't think that they try to force anything upon one another. I feel like people do try to make it like a big deal, but honestly, who they are, they can be quiet at times, but when they speak, everything that they say is important. And I think that their relationship is their relationship and it's been awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I like it a lot better being on their side rather than -- rather than going against them just because I've been in situations where I've had to guard both of them in a series and it's extremely difficult. The way they play, the way they complement each other, especially being aggressive getting into the paint, both being great playmakers in the first game, balancing that with scoring and making everybody better I'm glad I'm on this side."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, for sure. He's probably our best defender, so hearing that is pretty empowering. Really all you're trying to do is make it as hard as you can on a guy like Luka. He's so good. He's going to make some tough shots even if you do play really good defense. You have to know its going to happen and just have to have a next-play mentality in terms of that. We were really connected last game, and we have to continue to be that way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Just try to help the team win in any possible way and bring energy. I thought I did a pretty good job of that. You know, just got to continue to do that, and that's probably going to be my role throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I work on it every day in practice. You don't really get an opportunity to shoot them in the game very often. I think I maybe had one or two throughout this season. But that one just happened to be the NBA Finals and people are making a big deal out of it. I don't know, I mean, I put the work in, and sometimes you get to showcase it like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I had a great community growing up that supported me and helped me, you know, get to this point for sure and had influence on my path growing up. It's pretty cool to have those people still reaching out, like schoolteachers, coaches. Obviously, my family and friends always have kept tabs, but it's pretty cool to have those people reaching out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"You've just got to be disciplined. My mom always says, just treat others with respect, and you're bound to receive that from them as well. Just treat everyone the same and put your work in. Don't worry about what other people say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I would just say he's like got a unique approach to the game. He pulls things from, like, soccer teams, pulls things from killer whales and how they go about finding food and prey, things like that, and he ties it into the game of basketball. And I think it's a unique way to go about it. It's different and cool and engaging."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,I'll let him. I dont really know how to describe it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I mean, nothing in particular. Just I didn't even do it before the game. It was more of something I could turn to when I need something to switch things up. I feel like if you need extra motivation to play in the NBA Finals, you're probably in the wrong business. I was ready to go and get back out there and just got to continue, like I said before, just bring energy and help this team any way possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,First stretch of the game I tried to come up and tried to be aggressive and try to help my team. Just trying to put pressure and try to make possessions and try to find my teammates when they was open.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"No, he has not shown us film of his old playing days, but he does do a good job of emphasizing us playing with pace and pushing the pace and playing fast."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"I feel like the bond is growing stronger. We are around each other every day and we talk to each other, hang out and play games. I feel like our bond is really close."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"It's always good to learn from Sham. He's a good person. Always come here with joy and his background and history behind this game and with the moves Sham got, he just brought a lot of history to this game. You know, it's just good to have people like him out here helping us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"He's been telling us from the jump before we even got here that coming into this thing it was going to be a fight and staying composed and composure and sticking together. There are times when they go on runs in a game. So sticking together and staying together throughout their runs. And I feel like if we do a good job of doing that and going into Game 2 and playing with physicality and pace, we will have a good chance of winning Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"To all the Mavericks fans that traveled here, we appreciate you all and we love you, and we are going to try to get this win for you all and go back 1-1 to Dallas with the series tied."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Just staying positive. We've been in this situation before many times, just in this year. So I think for us just being positive and knowing how good we are as a team and just being aggressive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"The same way that happened in OKC and in the Clippers series, making sure that we stay together as a team. Look at adjustments we need to make, and we have done that. Go over film and look at the mistakes we've made and just make a positive from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"It was great. Everybody dreams of being in the Finals. That first bit of getting the jitters out. It's amazing, amazing fans. It was a great atmosphere and it's what basketball is about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. Our team is a very close team. Probably the closest team I've ever been on. It's a family. We have young guys. It's a young team. The guys, everyone really likes each other. I think that's what really helps our team is how connected we are and we are able to make adjustments. We are also able to talk openly about what we need to do to improve our game and how we can help one another."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,Not Luka. I don't know. Anyone but Luka.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"He does an amazing job. In his mind, it's another game. At the end of the day, we have one thing, and that's to win a championship. So I think he's done an amazing job of being a leader and a front-runner for this team. He's been a leader the whole year, and it really rubs off on the team and is contagious."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. I think being nervous is completely normal, especially for me. So I think just being here and being a part of it, it's fun. To me, being nervous isn't a bad thing. But at the end of the day, now it's time for us to make sure we are doing everything we can to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"We need to be more aggressive, and we need to be way more aggressive. Looking back at every single one of these playoff series, we've been the aggressive team. And, yeah, just communication-wise. Just small things can really help out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I just think how together we are as a team. Like I said, the coaches do an amazing job of reacting to situations. Going back to the drawing board. Realize what we need to do as a team and be able to show the team, and I think the guys are good at making the adjustments we need to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, I've seen a lot of things that we can adjust on and be better at. We have to push guys in, play inside the perimeter. That was pretty much just the main thing. Better transition defense and taking care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I have a lot of confidence in this team. We have always found ways to take that next step in the right direction, because we like having adversity and always came together instead of tearing apart. That's the main thing we focused on going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,We always get hit in the mouth in the first game. Leaves a bad taste in our mouths. We have to come out the next game to rinse that out.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Just the energy around it. We know that there are things that we can be better at from the first game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much every day, just like after media. We are going to be watching film after this. It's always easy to sit down and go through the things that we can obviously do better and be better at. When it comes to the coaches, we always kind of like joke around here, like, oh, do it again. But this is what it takes to be able to survive at this stage. This is the last series of the year for us. Survival of the fittest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not necessarily. I feel like he took the right approach to everything he did. He was in foul trouble, but he stayed poised. A lot of guys, they will get in their own head, get aggravated, frustrated. He stayed with it, and that's something that shows maturity on his side just being a young guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just shows the better of the two sides. In the first half, we didn't really play good. We came out in the second half with our heads on straight. It just shows that we can take that step in the right direction, just put us in position to withstand for 48 minutes. We don't want to come out and just let anybody punch us in the face. We have to find ways to react the right way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Be as physical as we were the first game. And just pray he doesn't make all his mid-range.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Really just have the confidence in our offense, making sure that we have poise and really just not getting sped up when it comes to the pace offensively. They are a scrappy team defensively. We have to find ways to get around that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think just be a little bit more aggressive. I think we all came out for the game with little energy. So I think we have to be better with our energy especially from the start."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"No, I don't think so. I mean, we talk about it, but we've just got to stay together. I think we talk about, too, we've got to talk more on the court than we did in Game 1. So that's got to be better from my side, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's big. This is the team that drafted me, and the team that believed in me. So I'm really happy to represent Dallas. Hopefully it's not the last time. But I think the whole Dallas fan base is proud of our team. So I'm happy to represent them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know, but I'm just trying to have fun. That's the game I love. That's the game that gets me paid. And nothing better in the world than playing basketball for your job. So just trying to enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,I already knew it. Laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Not yet. I mean, not since he was -- he signed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, it just depends on how fast we get the ball up the floor. If we are walking the ball up the floor and we start the offense at 17 or whatever, it's different from you starting your offense at 20 because you've got the ball up the floor. So I think that goes into it, if you've got a little bit more time, maybe you can scan the floor a little bit. But for the most part, you want to kind of make quick decisions and keep the ball moving."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,I don't have no reaction.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I don't know. It's a team game. We're trying to focus on that, and, you know, everybody has their own opinions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,Say that one more time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, coming out even more aggressive but even more disciplined. You know, Dallas is a really good team, and they have responded very well to Game 1 losses. They come back in Game 2. So we're going to get a forceful, more aggressive team on Sunday, tomorrow. We've got to be ready because they are really good after a loss. So we can't be surprised, and that's what I'm preparing my team for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just trying to keep them off balance. They got -- they are here for a reason. They are well-coached. They do their roles. They perform their roles well. So can't give them the same look every time because they are -- you know, the more comfortable they get, the better they are. So just try to keep them off balance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I remember it being a pretty cool experience. I see some young guys in our league now, like walking around and stuff like that. I think that's pretty cool when I was -- it was before I got drafted, like you said, and I was still, you know, fresh out of college and, you know, I knew some -- because I played at Cal Berkeley, I knew some of the guys on the Warriors. Steve Kerr's son was my friend at Cal. I went to a lot of Warriors games that season. You know, I got to meet a lot of those guys and talk to a lot of those guys before I even got to the NBA. Mainly Andre Iguodala, who is like an older brother, mentor, to me now. But, you know, those experiences were everything. You know, being able to see what a winning environment looked like. Being able to talk to guys who have done things at the highest of levels and then give you encouraging words and wish you well and good luck. That was -- that was my experience in the NBA Finals in 2016 or whenever that was before I got drafted. I think that's part of the reason why I was able to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But we've been just extremely focused on what our roles and our jobs are. We have all had to sacrifice. Jason Kidd has had to do that at the highest of levels, right, and I respect him and tip his cap for it. Right now, at this point, it's whatever it takes to win and we can't let any outside interpretations try to get in between us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought the crowd was good. I think we can be a little bit better. So I expect us to be even louder. Sunday, we are going to need our fans to be hyped. It's not just team versus team. It's crowd versus crowd. It's gas station versus gas station. Supermarket versus supermarket. It's the whole city versus the whole city. We need everybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just watching film, taking your time. Seeing and reading the game. Being aggressive. Not hesitating. But also, you know, making the right plays. Like you said, being in the right spot. Spacing has a lot to do with that. Making sure our team is properly spaced, and then being aggressive from there. We expect them to be a lot more aggressive on defense, Dallas, coming out into this Game 2. So that's going to put an emphasis on us to be more disciplined. We have to get to our spacing well. We've got to make the right read. Got to take care of the ball. Can't do stupid fouls because we expect a great punch from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"It's a little bit of everything. I mean, Joe kind of gives us the freedom to trust our instincts, and then you also know that, like, if someone gets beat, someone's going to have your back, and we just fly around after that. So just a little bit of everything and just competing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think, like, we just took a breath, stayed together, stayed composed, and just kind of got good looks offensively, moved the ball. We got good looks, and I feel like that close in the third was huge. Kind of just put 'em away, kept a distance. So credit to the guys that are out there just staying together, getting stops defensively, and making the right reads offensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, you never really know, coming back from injury. We just seen him -- all the hard work he's been putting in. But you, like, never really know, to miss all that time and come back for The Finals. But he was unreal today and it's nice to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we just won one game. We know they're going to be better. I think we have seen it in the playoffs this year. Like, they have lost Game 1's and they came back and played better. So just it's one game. We got to learn from it, we got to grow, and understand that we're going to need to play a lot better Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's a matchup nightmare. Even when you play good defense, he doesn't really see you. It's been unreal just watching him all year. Then defensively, he uses his size well, just impacts the games in so many different ways. He changes us and he makes us a better team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it can be anybody. I think it was JB that timeout. But Al, JT, Jrue. I can say, like, that's the great thing about this team, is if there's something that needs to be said, people are going to say it and we're willing to accept that and grow from it. So, I mean, it can be anybody that's playing. Like X Xavier Tillman has said stuff in the past that has helped us, so there's a lot of guys that have the voice and we're just learning and growing with each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, they're a really good team. They're going to make runs, they're going to make tough shots, they're going to -- I mean, they're going to make it difficult for us. We didn't expect it to be easy. I mean, I wish you could just stop it after, like, one point, that would be nice, but I think you just got to figure out why you're struggling and just try to limit those mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, JB'S unreal on the perimeter. I mean, blocking shots obviously he had two big-time blocks. He can just do everything on the basketball court and he has like no weaknesses on both sides. So, he's big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think anytime you go through something like that and all the experience that we've gathered through like the ups, the downs, like, all that has just helped us to be a better team. So we've learned from everything and, like, this core group has been together through a lot of adversity, so I definitely think it helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, those two are unreal, great players, great teammates, and they just do so many little things for us on both sides of the basketball, so it's amazing having them as our team on our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It felt great. To be honest, I was nervous. I ain't going to lie. I was nervous in like an anxious way, as like a little kid. It's surreal being in The Finals. When you're young, I guess, in your career, you think you're always going to go back. Last year was kind of like a wake-up call when we didn't make it. So getting back to this point and being here is really a big deal. We played well tonight. There's a lot of things we feel like we could do better. But it definitely does feel good to win the first game. But we know that two years ago we won the first game and the outcome of that series. So we still have a lot of work to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, you always want to have your team at full strength. We're a good team when guys are down, but we're really, really special when we have everybody. I said it earlier, how seamless his transition was after being away for six, seven weeks, and coming into the game and having a first half like that, that was a big spark for us to start the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Thanks for reminding me.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think you guys got a pretty clear picture of that throughout the season, when we were healthy for most of that and how we played and how effective we were on both ends. KP had a big hand in that and the success that we had this season. Obviously, getting hurt in the playoffs, we had to figure it out. We had to adjust and play different lineups and whatever. 12-2 up to that point, we did a really good job. But it is a relief to have him back because we know we're a much better team when he's back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, and they go hand in hand. Al has stepped up into that starting role and at this stage in his career being a, you know, center piece of us getting to The Finals is something that shouldn't be overlooked. His presence out there on both ends of the floor, what he allows us to do offensively, dragging out the big men. You know, and we have had playoff games where Al has hit six, seven threes. Even if he doesn't, you have to, the other team has to respect him as a shooter, so it just helps with our spacing. So, can't give Al enough credit for the impact that he's had on this playoff run."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think when you look at JB, he's somebody that has really worked on his craft year after year to just become a better player. I think you can tell by the way that the game has slowed down for him and the way he's making reads on the offensive end. That doesn't happen just overnight, it's a process. And I've seen it, I've seen the work that he puts in and watching film and things like that. So it's special to see when guys put in the work and it translates to on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think just, being his teammate for seven years, we've been in so many big games, we've been in so many big moments, and just always being there to answer the call in those moments, especially on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think our offense got a little stagnant and it had a lot to do with our spacing. They kind of put us into some bad ways on offense which kind of threw off our spacing and slowed us down. They started to get stops, running in transition, but that's part of it. They're going to make shots. That's a really good team over there. We just did a great job of responding in realtime after Joe called that timeout. They cut it to eight, we came to the bench and talked about it, executed and made plays and took the lead back up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Just staying present, staying in the moment. Like I said, I was, in a positive way, I was nervous before the game. I was like a kid first day of school. I know how exciting and big of a deal all of this is, so just finding a space to enjoy the moment and have fun playing basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Something that we have harped on all season, what makes our team really special is we don't have guys that we hide on defense. Bigs and guards, we switch, we take on the challenge of individual defense. Understanding that we have help, it's a team sport, we all got to be on the same page, but we're not showing or anything like that, because that could kind of compromise your defense. And, essentially, like, if you want to play on our team you have to be able to guard, and everybody knows that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to say like -- I didn't doubt him, but I just, you know, coming off an injury and missing that much time, it normally takes guys a little longer than that, but as somebody as tall and talented as he is, he makes it look really easy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Maybe last year, us losing in the Conference Finals. Maybe I just expected that after we lost in 2022 that it was guaranteed that we were just going to keep coming back, and this is like our time. Last year it was just kind of a wake-up call to not take anything for granted, because you never know how many opportunities that you might have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Thank you all for being here. I want to begin with someone who is a familiar face at the Finals, and that's Bill Walton, who we lost last week. Of course, Bill won two championships but also covered multiple NBA Finals for NBC and then ABC. He and his wife, Lori, often sat, as many of you remember, at these press conferences, usually somewhere over there. I'm thrilled that Lori Walton is going to actually be at the game tonight, and Bill's four sons are going to be here, as well. The Celtics team was looking for a way to honor him tonight, and in addition to a pregame moment, the Celtics players are going to be wearing a special Bill Walton shooting shirt. So you're going to be seeing these shortly. The guys are going to be coming out and warming up in this jersey. We're happy about that. In addition, Bill was someone who became a very close friend in the over the 30 years that I've been with the league. Many of you in this room have been covering the league for a long time, as well, and he traveled with us everywhere we went. I remember the first time we played in China, in 2004, being on the Great Wall with him. He was quite an adventurer. I can't think of a better ambassador for the NBA than Bill. He enjoyed talking to every single person. Increasingly, internationally who understood he must have played basketball, wasn't quite sure who he was, and he would explain to them. But even some of you know, right up until this past season, he was working. He was doing an alternate telecast with us called Throw It Down, and even Bill sort of continued to cover the game, couldn't stop complimenting the current players. I think he saw the staggering ability of these young guys and was constantly complimenting them. Every generation of young player came to know him. And just lastly say he'll be missed, and my condolences to Lori and his four boys. It's a sad moment in the league. Speaking of NBA's international presence, I know there are 26 different countries represented here today with media members, so I want to thank you for traveling so far to be here. In addition, these Finals will be carried in 214 countries and territories. This group of players will represent the largest contingent of international players ever we've had in the Finals 13 players of the combined two teams were born outside of the United States. So the global growth of the NBA continues unabated. Basketball as a sport continues to grow enormously on a global basis. Wonderful to see how much is happening in the women's game, as well, in the WNBA here in the United States, and we're looking forward to the Paris Olympics, where basketball will be a mainstay, men's and women's. Another exciting time. It was interesting, I was watching Luka Doncic yesterday, just an example of how international this league is. Of course, someone who grew up in Slovenia and trained in Madrid and Spain and was doing interviews in three different languages. Again, many of you spend time with him, but he's an exemplar of the modern NBA. And with that, I'm happy to answer questions. I only speak one language, unfortunately, so please in English. Thank you again for being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Well, just begin by saying I don't want to cover specifically on what's been written in the media other than to say, yes, absolutely. I would just say plural, where you say TV deal, it's TV deals. Of course, there's discussions with our incumbents and other interested parties. It is incredibly complex. I look at my colleague Bill Koenig sitting in the front row, president of our media division, who has been literally working around the clock on this, along with a team of others at the league office. And it's complicated for several reasons. One is the advent of new platforms, particularly streaming, and the interest of streaming companies, and then the traditional media companies also carrying our games on streaming platforms. It's complicated with multiple partners all seeking similar assets. In many cases, just figuring out the right way to balance those games as they go to different partners. Then lastly, as you've said, we tend to do long-term deals. We think that's good for the stability of the league, but it means to a certain extent you're trying to predict the future, which is of course impossible. So part of it is a bet on the partners that we will ultimately align with and their ability also to adjust with the times and their willingness to continue to invest in media and also become global, which to my earlier point is very important to the league, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Sure. The advent of Team Ignite, for those of you who don't know, a team of younger players playing within the G League, in essence a select team, was in response to both President Obama, then at the time in office, who was pushing us hard and the basketball community to create a professional track for players who were not interested in playing college basketball, and at a time when they were not being compensated for playing college basketball. In addition, it was the result of conversations with Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, who was overseeing a committee on behalf of the NCAA, who made similar recommendations and said that I think our view was that these young men should not be forced somehow to go to college, if the only reason they were going to college was in preparation for the NBA as opposed to preparation for life. Our response was, we hear you, and we created this Team Ignite program. We were paying these players directly. I think Team Ignite served its purpose. I don't necessarily think that the changes in NIL, legislation and these ongoing changes in college sports were a direct result of it. I think it helped, though, demonstrate the value for these young players, but we got to the point now with Team Ignite where frankly we felt it didn't make sense to compete against these top college programs, where in many cases have better facilities, top-notch coaching, charter aircraft, et cetera. We thought this was a good time to step back and reassess what our role should be in junior basketball. Not just with the G League, but I'll add I've had some discussions with Charlie Baker, the head of the NCAA, about the joint role we potentially can play in helping even at a younger age helping develop top-flight youth basketball, boys, girls, young men, young women, in the United States in particular. I think that is something that we should focus on. It's interesting, as you look at the growing body of international players in the NBA, Luka Doncic as an example before, who in essence went on a professional track beginning at 13 with Real Madrid, there's clearly some improvement we could use in the U.S. system for the training of these elite players. There's no doubt they come into the league as some of the most skilled players in the world, but in many cases they haven't -- it's not that they haven't learned team basketball, but because of the way the system works, they're constantly changing teammates, they're jumping from program to program. You can tell that the international players in many cases are just learning a different style, and in some cases a more efficient and winning style of basketball, team play basketball than we're seeing in some of the U.S. programs. So I would add USA Basketball to the NCAA and the NBA and I'm sure that shoe companies have an interest in doing this, too. Pulling back on Team Ignite was just the beginning, but I think as we complete our media deals, for me this will be, and Mark Tatum, Deputy Commissioner, is sitting here, will be one of our next major projects. So we're really focused on what our role should be in youth basketball in the United States and globally, for that matter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"I'll leave the specific question about the foul to my colleague, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. Other than as a fan, obviously it's nothing new in basketball that there's sort of ""welcome to the league"" moments, especially for heralded rookies, but of course I want to see Caitlin treated fairly and appropriately in the league. I would say it seems like she can take care of herself. She's a tough player. I think it may be lost on some people that are new to basketball, in terms of a little bit of controversy in the WNBA, what an incredible talent she is two Final Fours, leading scorer in the history of college basketball. I look forward to watching her ongoing development in the league. I think ultimately this is very healthy for women's basketball and the WNBA. It's generating tremendous additional interest. In fairness to the other players and in fairness to Commissioner Engelbert, this didn't just start this year. Certainly we're seeing an acceleration of it with Caitlin, but many individual stars who came in this league in the last several years. And then, again, I've been with the league for a long time. So I was there in the early days with Val Ackerman, and of course David Stern, when we developed the WNBA. In some ways, to me, this was a long time coming. If you went back and looked at our original business plan from 28 years ago, we didn't think it would be such a long timeline to break into the popularity we're seeing now. Ultimately, I don't want to make too big of an issue about one particular player, one particular call. But I think the burgeoning rivalries within professional basketball, you see rivalries obviously among clubs but also among individual players, too, and I think that can be ultimately good for the sport. But at the same time, there's also some larger societal issues at work. There's no doubt. I don't want to hide from that. Some having to do with race, and they're very apparent. I think sports historically has been a platform for people to talk directly about these issues. I don't think we should hide from them, and I think the players are happy to engage on these issues. They're sophisticated people. But ultimately let the public join part of those conversations, as well, and of course the media will weigh in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Well, part of it, I don't want to sound overly confident, it has much to do with watching where media is moving, where top-notch content now that we're seeing on the various streaming platforms, the fact that maybe Netflix being the latest in terms of their Christmas Day deal for NFL games, that many of these platforms that only six months or a year ago that were reluctant to come to premium live sports are now jumping in. If you watch where the eyeballs are going, and I'm sure it's true for people in this room, as well, we're all moving into watching premium programming on streaming services. Also, part of where my confidence goes in moving sports over to streaming platforms and something I've talked about before, it allows for tremendous additional functionality when it comes to watching games, personalization, customization of games, multiple feeds, multiple dialects, multiple languages, different camera angles. It really gives the fan enormous additional choice that you don't have through traditional television. Trying to predict how fast this will move is I think what's so difficult. I think there's been a faster decline in cable viewership, cable usage and viewership than people were predicting even only two years ago, and the move is happening fast to streaming services. So what we're trying to do as part of these television deals is middle sort of the use still of the broadcast platform. Of course, the Finals are on ABC in the United States. Still matters tremendously to us. Traditional cable, it's not going away, but it's continuing to decrease. And then streaming platforms are seeing accelerated growth, particularly around premium live sports. We're sort of trying to put foot, hand, finger in sort of every one of those buckets."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort. In terms of what Dallas did last year, we sanctioned them. We did what we thought was appropriate at the time. I would only say that the success they saw this season, that they're now seeing in the Playoffs and here they are at the Finals, I don't attribute it to one draft pick, as important as that draft pick has been to their team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Look, I'd say Pat McAfee, that's what you're referring to, he apologized, and I accept that. I think that the way media works these days, when people are online for hours, they're going to occasionally misstep. I think what's important is the context, their intention and sort of what they're willing to say about having done that. I leave it to ESPN to make their own personnel decisions about what the consequences of things like that. But I accept sort of in a free society, where there's a lot of conversation, a lot of dialogue, and I think it's for the WNBA, of course, it's going to be a two-edged sword. Many of us in this room go back to David Stern, where we sat in meetings and he was pleading with some of the very reporters sitting her to cover the WNBA and women's basketball. Now we're being covered, and once you get covered in an extensive way, it's a little bit of a product of how media works these days, that you're going to see occasional statements that people aren't happy with. But I think that my sense is at least what I read, the player accepted the apology. I think in the context of how he said it, I think matters a lot these days. I don't want to get into sort of the cliched cancel culture debate. But I worry about that, that sort of this notion that if somebody seems to be a person of goodwill is saying things that in the context seem actually supportive of the player but says a word like that, that we all say shouldn't have been said, and he's the first to acknowledge he shouldn't, I don't want to overblow it. I think that we can move on from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Bill Koenig, can you tell me when the media deals will be over so I can begin the expansion process? Laughter. In all seriously, I meant what I said. We do need to finish up -- I think I said a few years ago, collective bargaining agreement, new media deals, then we would turn to expansion. So we got part one done clearly, and thank you to the Players Association. We are very happy, I think both sides are, with our collective bargaining agreement. Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process. But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"I'm absolutely fine with that. It's interesting, times change. There used to be concerns even geographically of players from a certain part of the country and how will they feel about that player in that market, because the player played for a top college somewhere else or from somewhere else. I think it's increasingly a global league in that wherever that player is from, and Luka Doncic is a great example, Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee, I think if that player becomes part of that community, lives in that community, gives of himself or herself in the WNBA to that community, I think they become part and parcel. I don't think it's any different that I went to Duke University and when a player is playing for Duke and Duke fans are all in, they're not so focused on where that player is from, whether in the United States or Luol Deng or other players from outside the United States. It's a global market. At the same time, I will say to my earlier point, it is important that we focus on proper development of American players. I just think for the sport, still we're a U.S.-based business, the majority of our revenue still comes from the United States. I feel an obligation to the game, as well, and I know I speak for the head of the NCAA, who played college basketball. Over time, like for example, we're up to about 30 percent of our players are international. When you think about the amount of basketball being played globally and the U.S. is a little less than 5 percent of the global population, that number of international players will only rise. Statistically, you're going to see more top-notch international players in the league. It doesn't mean, though, that there won't still be great U.S. players, many of whom we're going to see on the court tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"It has been difficult. That show in particular is special. I have a close relationship with everyone who's on that show, from the time they played in the league, as well, and Ernie and I have been friends forever. At the same time, it's not just the talent, of course. You've been in production yourself. There's hundreds of longtime people who have been involved with what I still refer to as Turner Sports, who have been longtime friends and colleagues, and no different at the other networks. On one hand, from the league standpoint, it's fantastic to be liked and to be wanted and to have multiple suitors. At the same time, it makes me uncomfortable that it's zero sum, that at the end of the day there's only going to be so many television packages, there's only so many Finals games and playoff games and regular-season games to distribute. I will say directly from me, directly to your question and the people who seem to be most impacted right now, the folks at Turner Sports, I apologize that this has been a prolonged process, because I know they're committed to their jobs. I know people who work in this industry. It's a large part of their identity and their family's identity, and no one likes this uncertainty. I think it's on the league office to bring these negotiations to a head and conclude them as quickly as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"In terms of the last part of your question, we're not considering right now opening up control of teams to institutional capital. We think it's still very important that there be individuals and ultimately a singular governor who has ultimate decision making for a team. We've seen examples historically where, putting aside institutions, there have been multiple individuals, and it's led to all kinds of contention and controversy. So I don't see that happening, at least in the foreseeable future. In terms of institutional capital being invested in teams, in some ways it's a good problem to have, as you said, as the value of these teams continue to grow and grow at a fast pace. There are only so many individuals literally in the world who can cut those sort of checks to invest in the majority of capital required to purchase these teams. So we think we've found ourselves in a pretty good spot where you have individuals with control pieces of team, other individuals who are investing alongside of them, but then to complete the cap chart, you have institutional investors. The institutional investors, of course because the values are going up right now, seem very pleased with those investments. I think historically we were concerned, before we allowed institutional investors, that they would be short-timers and that they would be looking to quickly flip their investments. We haven't seen that. In fact, this is your area, not mine, from the Financial Times, that it's become more sort of permanent capital in a way as opposed to being short-term investments. The investment community is looking now at sports teams, particularly premium sports teams, not just the NBA, as an investment category in a diversified portfolio that in many cases moves in an alternative ways from the market as a whole. It rounds out a portfolio and it seemingly is working well for everyone right now. Lastly, I'll just say that this policy is only a few years old. Institutional investors who don't comply with our current policy, some particular funds have been in to see us, and to say we would like to be an investor in your league or in teams, and would you consider adjusting some of your policies, not necessarily to allow us to be a control owner, maybe they would like that one day, but in other ways, to ease up some of the restrictions, and that's something that we'll continue to look at. By the way, I know the NFL is looking at some of these same issues right now, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"First of all, as you said, that's an ongoing process in terms of the arbitration. That was a process they agreed to in the purchase agreement. The league office is completely independent of that. Yes, the next step, were they to win that arbitration, would be then to continue through the league vetting process, and then ultimately what would be required would be a vote of the Board of Governors to approve them as owners."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"The only reason I won't comment on that is because that would be obviating the entire vetting process that needs to continue, and then is ultimately for the owners to take that vote."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"It may impact things if we were now at the point where they had won the arbitration and the group was being vetted for ownership. But as far as I know, and I only -- I don't have personal knowledge of that deal, I read it, as well, that's independent of the issues that are now at issue in the arbitration."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"When it comes to injury data, we're constantly studying it, trying to see if there's more than correlation and there's actually causation. Of course, this past season, even though we had the 65-game rule, largely designed to keep star players on the floor, we had a decrease in injury in star players. I'm not standing here saying one followed from the other. It just may be happenstance for this season. I think we saw injuries, of course, in the Playoffs this year, but nothing that out of range with injuries we've seen in the past. I think, look, there's nothing more important than keeping our players on the floor. One of the things I know Andre Iguodala and I, it's great having him now as the head of the Players Association, just based on his experience as a star player in this league, a championship-caliber player, that we're trying to step back and say, what is it that we need to do to incentivize guys to play and keep them healthy, and are there things we need to adjust in the schedule, are there other areas. You're talking about the Playoffs now that we look at. I will say just based on one season of data, we're happy with the 65-game rule. There was sort of a parade of horribles that had rolled out, that had been rolled out, that everybody was saying, were threatening were going to happen. Those things didn't happen. In terms of not just a reduction in star player injuries this year, but it worked to the extent we saw star players on the floor more. That was the goal. Whether there's some connection in terms of additional injuries and Playoffs, we don't know. This is an area that confounds us in some ways. I will say that we worked with the players successfully in the collective bargaining agreement on this issue, and I think with Andre's leadership, sort of a commitment on both sides, let's keep looking at it. We have the same incentives, and that is to keep star players on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Fair question. It's where we should be able to make the most progress. As I've said before, you're always going to have human error in the case of referees. It doesn't mean we can't continue to do a better job training officials. But when it comes to technology, again, it's one of the things we've been talking to the Players Association a lot about and the Referees Association, too, and I'm thinking once the season ends this year, maybe we even put together a task force of the constituent groups. A guy named Evan Wasch in the League Office is leading this initiative. We're in discussions with Hawkeye, the technology they use in tennis. As I've said for a while, it's harder than I understood it to be, but if there's a category of objective calls that you can not only take off the floor but frankly out of the replay center. Buzz, Celtic ball, because it's automated, foot on the line, which one of the hundred fingers on the floor touched the ball last at that time. As I said they're working through that. But technology will solve that, and I think it's the same for replay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,I'm not going to get into that only because it's a complex legal issue.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think obviously what helped me is just even from the walk out before the game and then getting on the court, getting that kind of support was unreal. The adrenaline was pumping through my veins and that definitely helped. Obviously it wasn't ideal that I was out for such a long time, but I did everything I could to prepare mentally for this moment coming back and it paid off and we got the job done tonight and had a good game and happy about the result."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, from day one I came here and I said like I'll do whatever it takes to help this team win, right? I think it was -- this situation, you know, it made sense. I didn't care. I didn't care. I knew I could prepare to come off the bench, which is something different for me, and that's what I did and stepped into that role and embraced it and had a good game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no. Yeah -- what was the question? Laughing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, at the end of the day, it's like, it's just basketball. It's okay, it's high intensity, it's like more -- you know, like, intricacies of the game and stuff, like, more focus on little details. But at the end, it's just basketball and I've been doing this for a long time. Even if I have time off, I can jump right back in and I feel the same way. I get to my spots and I do, so whether it's playoffs regular season or whatever, I know how to do this. That's it, just having that confidence, going out there whatever, first round or Finals, just going out there with full confidence and giving what I have to the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know, even when that first quarter when I checked in and start things going my way and stuff, I didn't even think about it. I was so in the moment and enjoying the moment and the crowd and everything, you know. I don't know, it's kind of like a blur to me right now. I have to re-watch the game, what happened and stuff, but I was completely just in the game. That's the best feeling. Like, I had the most fun and, yeah, and I hope to have more of those moments going forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not in a sense of, like, am I going to be okay. Like, it was only like physical. Am I going to be good to go physically, not -- skills-wise, there was never -- at least for me never no doubt. But of course, you have ups and downs throughout the game, like all this stuff happens, but mainly for me, it was to get there physically and once I felt pretty good and the medical staff had my back and we did everything correct to get to this point, then they gave me the green light, I was good to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, we had a conversation and just came up to me, I know he knew I was going to be fine with whatever, you know, so he just told me, what do you think, like about this, and I said, of course, like, let's do it. And that's it. Wasn't no big deal and I trust Joe and he trusts me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know, but Joe always gives us the right message, you know what I mean? He himself is very almost -- like, he can be emotionless if that's what we need and he can just come in, like, completely even keel and give us the right message of what to focus on. And then he can come in and give us some motivation if that's what we need in that moment, some energy. But I think there he was just even keel and giving us some of the answers to what we need to do out there and that was it, we trust him with his leadership."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, a little bit of everything. A little bit of everything, right. It's tough to not play for a month and then jump into the highest intensity game in The Finals, it's obviously very tough. But as I said, I did everything I could to prepare for this moment, like mentally, and then just going out there and playing instinctually almost, you know, and trusting my body. And that was it. And as I said, like the support around me was great to get to this moment, and now, yeah, we just have to keep going and take care of business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just thought it gave us the best chance to win. He was great on both ends of the floor, defensive execution, game plan, playing for a spot in the offensive end, being physical, and making plays on both ends of the floor. So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just poise. They have a great defensive system, great defensive team, throw a bunch of stuff at you, different spacings, different coverages. The poise to just figure it out. Make the right play is going to be the most important thing. I thought he had that throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, game management is going to be important. This is a great team. They have a tendency to go on great runs. That's going to happen. You have to be able to manage those with poise and execution, know why those runs are being made, and quickly put a stop to them with high-level execution. So KP was a huge part of that, that run. But I liked the way we handled their run, because that's going to happen. You're not going to stop that. You just have to have the poise and the toughness to work through it and I thought our guys did that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"What you saw tonight is kind of the challenge he took for himself coming into the year. Not wanting to be defined by one thing. Wanting to make plays. Wanted to be a well-rounded player and get better and better. So his spacing, his ball movement, his defense on ball and off ball. Usually when you give up a run and your offense gets a little stagnant, your defense goes with it. Tonight our defense kept us in it and that's really important, to have that defensive mindset. Some of those plays that Jaylen made were a part of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think a couple of great passes. JT stuck out, the one Jaylen threw to Al in the corner. I think it was either Jaylen or JT. But that's what those guys do, they have the ability to draw two guys and the most important thing is making the right play over and over again, doing what's best for the team, reading the two on ones, and when they're at their best, those guys are able to do that. I thought their decision making helped control the game, especially when they went on that run and we were able to get that back. We went back to -- with JT there and he was able to help us sustain that with a high-level execution, so that's really important when those guys do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I always talk to the players about what we think is best for the team and that it's that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know. I can't remember.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The one when they cut it to eight? Yeah, listen, it's the NBA Finals, you're playing against a great team and they're going to make runs. Just building on awareness to why the run was made and, you know, that team does a great job of making defensive adjustments on the fly and sometimes it takes us a possession or two to recognize that. So just understanding the run, what could we do to change it, and how can we get better coming out of that. So I thought the guys' poise out of that timeout was big and that's going to happen. They're going to go on more runs and we're going to have to fight through 'em."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, again, I thought our defensive mindset, our defensive execution, our defensive game plan, our positioning, we had the right intentions and I thought we played really physical, for the most part, defending without fouling. And on the offensive end, we made some physical drives, and so that's the key there, is just having the physical mindset on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I know the story line has to be, what's he going to look like because he was off for a month, but that's what he's been doing his whole career. He's a great player. He's been great for us. The reason why we are here is because of what he's done. It doesn't matter how long he takes off, the guy is going to make plays because of how talented he is and the work he puts in. What he did for us tonight was big and we need that for the rest of the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Um-hmm, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Out of the three minutes, two and a half of it they're by themselves, so I'm sure -- they communicate well with each other, they have great relationships, so I'm sure during the time the coaches are meeting that they're having that communication with each other. They do a good job of communicating with each other throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just sticking with the game plan. Game plan execution's very important. Having a clear understanding of what you have to take away on every possession, and just knowing that in order to defend these guys at a high level, you have to play efficient offense, and I thought we did that for the majority of the game, obviously, on the run. There weren't many live ball turnovers and we missed some open shots. They forced us into a couple tough shots, but we were able to manage the transitions of the game with our offensive execution and our defensive game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, they're going to make a lot of adjustments and they're going to do a lot of great things because of the talent that they have, so we have to execute the game plan, communicate coverages, communicate matchups, guys did a great job communicating to each other and keeping defense first."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just great individual defense. Everybody has to take on the challenge of guarding those guys. They're an amazing team and they put a ton of pressure on you with their ability to score. Everyone is going to take their matchup personal, have personal pride in individual defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,He's not on a minutes restriction and we haven't gone through that yet.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Same thing he's done for us all year. Defense, offense, communication, play hard. Just what he's done for us over the course of the season that's helped us get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, Jaylen is the kind of guy that just works hard, has a chip on his shoulder. I would say everything is motivation for him. I enjoy watching him when he works. He has a huge growth mindset and he's going to look to dig deep into weaknesses that he wants to get better at, makes his strengths better, never skips a detail. I would say he's one of the higher-motivated guys I've seen, just the way he works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No. We just talked to the staff, just Celtics, practice, getting better, and that's it really."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Honestly, same way every game day has looked. It's no different. We've got to rebound, we've got to sprint back, we've got to play defense, pay attention to detail. We have to pay attention to spacing, we have to execute, we have to crash. We've got to play hard. I can honestly say it hasn't looked any different, and the things that will go into winning this series are no different than the things that we talked about in preseason, habits, mindset, details, execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Same as they were first game of preseason, got to go out there and play. There's a game plan. We've got to be ready to execute it. But there's going to be adjustments, variables, things you're going to have to go through. In the short time I've been around I've been in some big games. The things that go into winning and losing are still the same. We can't be distracted by anything else. We've got to make sure we stick to those details. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's all the fundamentals of that are the same. You have to communicate. You have to build relationships with people. You have to have a great staff around you. You have to have great players. You have to get those players better. You have to empower people around you. You have to know whatever level you're at what goes into winning and what could lead to losing. I think no matter the level, it's all the same, and obviously each level presents different types of challenges, but you rely on those things that can be translated regardless of where you're at to help you, and it's the people around you and the way you can build relationships."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great player. They have a great team. There's no one way to guard these guys, especially when you have to play them over again. So you have to be open-minded to go into different things, absolutely. But the game is connected, so the offensive adjustments we make will be in large part by how we defend and our defensive adjustments we make will be in large part how we attack, and the game is connected, and those decisions are made by kind of those things, how one thing affects the other. But I don't anticipate one solution. You have to have multiple solutions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought give the Celtics credit. They did a great job defending, making it tough on us. We had some good looks that didn't go down. We've got to move the ball. The ball just stuck too much. And we'll be better in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he had great looks that just didn't go down. He had some great looks at three. He had some great looks in the paint. That's just part of basketball. Sometimes they go in. Sometimes they don't. Tonight, they just didn't go down for Ky or most of the team, and hopefully we get those same shots in Game 2 and we can be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, KP was great, he knocked down shots. He changed shots. He blocked shots. He gave them a spark when he came off the bench. We've just got to make it a little bit tougher on the offensive end. We've got to make him do something different. He got great looks and knocked them down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we did cut it to eight and got the rebound and unfortunately came up with a travel. A lot of good things in that third and fourth that we can build on. That's what we talked about after the game and that's what we have to do. We came out and won the third. Had a great opportunity to cut into that lead. Unfortunately, they go on a run. Once we cut it to eight, but then you know we won the fourth. So there are two positive things that we can take from these four quarters. We've got to be better in the first. They took advantage of that. They knocked down threes. But the big thing is, we have to be better as a team offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,They did great. They did great. And they will get better as the series goes on.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is the best team in the NBA and they are good for a reason. They play their style of basketball at a high rate. They generated 27 threes there in the first half, and made I think 11 of them. So we have to be better. We can't give them seven made threes in the first quarter. That would have outscored us with only scoring 20. So we have to be better. Give them credit. They were good tonight. But again, we've got to be better. Nerves or not being in this situation, we can't use that as an excuse. It's just basketball, and we've got to be better at the game of basketball on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought the group handled it well. At halftime, we talked about what we had to do, and I thought we did that coming out in the third. Again, cutting that lead, getting it to eight with the ball. Unfortunately, we traveled. And then from that point on, they took control of the game. But I thought the group responded. I thought we were better in the second half, and hopefully we can build on that third and fourth quarter going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think it's just about the positives. What can we do to build on the positives. We'll talk about that tomorrow. Understanding the small things, the physicality. We have to be better at that. But just looking at the positives. Looking at the things that we can control, and then we'll build from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We talked about it at halftime. I thought we weren't having fun there in the first half and we talked about having fun, to work the game, to continue to keep playing. There's a lot of time. A lot of people will talk about one game but we are talking about a series. So the bigger picture is to continue to keep working in the series and I thought the guys did a really good job there in the third quarter. We get the miss. We get the rebound. The momentum is going our way. Unfortunately, we traveled. So we just have to be better. We know that. Boston is a really good team, and so we've got to be better on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's a great number. Also lets you know that the G League is doing the right thing. The development of the G League and being able to have those players participate on the biggest stage. Again, 22? That's a lot. That's a great honor, and hopefully one of them can have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, you're talking about the second-best defense. We saw the best defense in Minnesota, so now we're going against the second best. Understanding they have a lot of great defenders one-on-one, so we expect that they're going to continue to throw different bodies at Luka and Ky. Those two as our quarterbacks have to be able to read who's guarding them and then being able to get the right guys in the pick-and-roll. We truly believe those two will make the right decisions, but when you talk about individual defense, Boston is one that will read a lot of the pick-and-rolls but also in isos just play one-on-one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think there's a lot of different paths. I'm happy when you talk about Hurley being mentioned as a candidate, JJ being mentioned, two different paths that could become head coaches in this league. Both basketball IQs extremely high. Whoever the Lakers choose, it's up to them. But when you talk about championships, Hurley has won two at UConn. I've gotten to play with Hurley in high school. He is a warrior. He's a champion. Coaching runs deep in their blood in that family. So if he was to become a Laker, that's incredible for him and his family but also for the Lakers. But JJ also has a basketball IQ and understands how to play the game the right way, and so either candidate is going to be great for the Lakers to choose from, but the path, there's a lot of different paths. Mark Jackson set the path for us, whove gotten older, who could not move, to figure out what we can do next. So when you talk about the path, Mark Jackson set the path. I'll always thank Mark privately that he gave us old-timers a chance to do something and still be involved in the game at a high level, and so I chose that path and I got lucky that the owners believed that I could do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I haven't really thought about that -- 2011, at the end of that game, just understanding what -- there's no one else to play. We're playing our best basketball, and being rookies, we didn't really know how to celebrate winning a championship. But when you sit there and you digest the situation of understanding that you just won a championship, it's just surreal because as a kid that's what you dream about. As a kid, you're watching Game 1 Boston against Dallas, and that's all you're working for is to be able to win a championship because you want to be like Magic, you want to be like Mike. To be able to do that in '11 was incredible. It's something that I will always treasure. That group of guys that we're linked to with Rick Carlisle as a coach, who led us was incredible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It's no different than the Western Conference stage. It's basketball. It's just a little bit more of you guys. But to embrace, as I talked this morning before we started talking about Boston, was the guys who get all the attention or most of the attention, share it with the younger guys who aren't getting interviews. When it is time for them to get interviewed, they know how to handle it. I just shared that with the team this morning, to understand Ky and Luka, this is also a great time to share how to handle things with the younger players because a lot of them haven't been in this situation. Luka has been in this situation since he was born. Ky has been in this situation for a couple times now. For those guys to be able to share it with them is my message. The basketball message is it's basketball, to have fun and embrace it and enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Ky and Luka as our quarterbacks, the respect that we have for one another, understand we all three have played the same position. Those two are a little bit more gifted than I am. The trust for one another for Ky -- myself, I've known Ky since I played in New Jersey, to see his journey, he's a champion. He's won, and now has us back into the Finals on the biggest stage. He's always enjoyed this situation. He always gets to celebrate his birthday first, even though we're born on the same day. But just to understand what he's gone through, that you can grow from different situations, and he's definitely done that, and he's really embraced Dallas, and he's playing his best basketball yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Al's journey, it's been incredible. It just seems like he's getting younger. He's been on great teams. He's always been a great teammate from afar, from what I've heard. Just understanding his skill set, being able to guard everyone on the floor as a teammate, being able to also stretch the floor, being able to shoot the three, and so longevity, he's doing something right when you talk about eating and taking care of your body and also mentally, because it can become draining. It can become where maybe I want to get on with my life and do something different. But again, his goal is to try to win a championship. Our goal is to try to delay that. But again, he's going to be one that's going to have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they've seen every coverage just like Luka and Ky, so we've got to be able to change it up. We can't give them a steady diet of one thing. They'll pick you apart. Again, when you get multiple bodies on the ball, that's when the three comes into play. Hopefully we can stay out of that situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way. We didn't perform the way we would have wanted to tonight. It starts with me just being able to get out there and get us settled. Got to take some accountability for just the communication, and just going out there and getting used to the way that the kind of environment was going to be. But I think my teammates did a great job of staying together, sticking to the game plan. We obviously made some mistakes, like I said, but we gave ourselves a chance in the second half and we just have to continue to do the right things and win the quarters as much as we can. They came out and hit us in the mouth early. Got the home crowd going into it. Down 17 in the first quarter. It's not really like us to give up 37 points. It's happened to us before in the playoffs, but we just wanted to make it a lot tougher on them. They hit a lot of threes. Again, when you get them rolling like that, they play a very easy game the rest of the game, and we've just got to hit them in the mouth a little bit. They did their job getting Game 1, but we are going to take our lessons and get ready for a good Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I don't necessarily agree it's a trap they want to set us. I think that they really rely on their great defensive ball pressure and one-on-one defenders. They funnel us into certain areas. Even as I say that, they are relying on the one-on-one, every time I got an iso, there's almost two, three people waiting for me to get in there. I have to catch the ball on a live dribble and just be aware of my opportunities. It's uncharacteristic for us to have only nine assists. The ball has got to move a little bit more. And again, that starts with me just being able to push the pace, get us some easy opportunities, and just adjust to what they are throwing at us. It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout. So just going to be replaying some of these possessions. But at the same time, looking at some of the positives that we can carry on to Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's basketball at the end of the day. You know, being in this environment, I'm used to it at this point. Early in my career, there was a different relationship that I had with Boston and just being able to come here, be settled with a veteran group. Now I'm here as a veteran, over the past few years, just experiencing the playoffs here, even regular season, it's been the same thing. I thought it was going to be a little louder in here but I'm expecting the same things going into Game 2. Crowd trying to get me out of my element, my teammates out of my element. But again, the energy has to be focused towards the game. I felt like I had a lot of great looks. They hit back rim or were just a little left or right. Just got to stay confident and stay poised throughout this, man. This is the best time of the year to be playing. There's only two teams left. Let's put it in perspective. The environment is going to be what it is but my focus is on our game plan and making sure my guys feel confident and I feel confident and continue to shoot great shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Very proud of them and amazed at how poised they are. This younger generation has a quiet confidence and a knowing about themselves. I think when we hit a little adversity, we have to know how to respond as a group and as a team. We talked about it in a lot of huddles but we have to act on it. That's what this game is about is controlling our actions, making sure that we stay positive, but also know what we are going up against, the competition level. We are the best in the world at this point. There are only two teams left. We have proven why we deserve to be here and we've earned our right to be here. It's no time to see ourselves as a short opponent or someone that's not capable of coming out of this. It's Game 1, but at the same time, we've got two days in between. So there's going to be a lot of noise and a lot of who played well, who didn't play well, who was under pressure. Just telling my guys, now is not the time to fall into that and be divided and be on social media all day listening to people that are not on the court with us. No disrespect to anybody but we are the players out there and we have to control what we can control and be ready to put on for each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Just settle in emotionally and just continue to pinpoint the things that were working for us where we are funneling their guys to where we want them to go and offensively playing off a live catch. They do a good job of loading up when we are on the dribble. They do a lot of reaching, a lot of verticality, effort. We have to give them credit. We are going against a great team and now is the time to just look at film, spend the next two days healing up and just getting ready for a physical Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Again, just look at film and then also be ready to wash our hands of what this game was and how we didn't rise to the occasion to start off the game. Just be able to battle with them during those runs. They are going to make some threes at times but we want to make them tough. When they are at home, they shoot incredibly well. We knew what we were getting ourselves into but until we experience it, then we wouldn't know. This is the first time this group is experiencing the Finals. We don't want to use that as an excuse. We want to use that as a strength. We want to use that energy that we have of just going into it and playing our game to our advantage, and then, you know, we'll see how the chess pieces fall in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it's not the first time I've lost in Boston. I don't want to continue to make it a habit but they've had a few games over me and they have our number -- not our number, I don't want to say our number but the past few teams I've been on, they have had my number a little bit. You have to give credit to a good team. They have been good the past three or four years. We want to show them respect but at the same time we want to bring our best game. We have to play four of our greatest games in order to win the series and in order to win the Finals. It's not about holding our heads up for one game if we didn't play well. It's the first to four and we obviously know that, but we have to play four complete games, four of our best games, and then we'll see where we stand after that. But in the meantime, we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and it starts with me as one of the leaders on the team, how can I be better and how can I be more poised in this environment. It's not the booing and it's not the missed shots. It's more or less our attitude and how we approach possession by possession. Our identity has been made on the defensive end. We have proven that. I have not had the best games offensively this playoff run but we have been able to get stops, timely stops and been able to pick each other up on the offensive end. We have all-world talent on this team, skillset is out of this roof, but now it's just about remaining confident and always knowing that you have somebody that's been through it but now it's our turn to go through it together. You know, this is what makes it exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, yeah, it's hard to compare just because you're going against different players, different series. But I will say that the next day was pretty cool, you know, because to see us still joined together in practice, still go through our day-to-day routines and rituals, and just hold each other up and hold each other accountable but in a very healthy way. We are very honest about what we can continue to do better and then we are very honest about how we can coach one another to be better. We are going to hear the familiar sentiment or familiar phrase that a lot of guys haven't experienced the Finals on our team, and that's okay. Experience is the best teacher, and once you get Game 1 out of the way or Game 2 out of the way you start feeling better about the series. But when you lose Game 1, there is a level of disappointment. We are human. I've always said that. We are going to feel the natural emotions. You feel the highs and lows of the journey but when you lose a game like this especially in the Finals where everyone is watching, it's going to hit you a little bit. But again, like I say, now is the time to not get on social media and not pay attention to what you guys are saying, no disrespect, but we've got to go out there and just focus on what we can control. I just know how the next two days are going to go. It's going to be very loud. It's going to be very chaotic at times. People are going to have words to say about how we can be better and how we can win or lose the series. Again, it's about us focusing on what we can control in that locker room, and we have great leaders in that locker room. So it's not just me who has that the experience that I'm going to be leaning on. I'm going to be leaning on everybody to help me out, too, as I help them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,It felt good. I think the whole key for us was to come out and defend home court and establish ourselves and we did that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Everyone was really locked in on the defensive end. The things that we needed to do, we just wanted to be very solid throughout. KP got to an unbelievable place there early in the first half, in the first quarter, and I just felt like it really got us going and took us to another level as a team. That was huge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It was great. I was pleasantly surprised to see how good he looked. He was very fluid and a lot of energy and moving well. We know he can score, but defensively he looked really good as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I mean, weve kind of known. At the end of the day for us, we understood what the mission was in front of us and what we needed to do. Everyone here was on board."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It feels good to win. But just know that the jobs not done. Never getting too high, too low. Just knowing that weve got to win Sunday and then two more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we set the tone early. That kind of gave us the lead and then when they made their hit, they got it within eight, we could withstand it and push it back up to 20. So we did a good job of just being poised."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,It takes a lot. Lock into the game plan. Two great scorers and playmakers in Luka and Kyrie. It takes a lot. It takes a full team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,Him being him. It was good to see it. You see him go out there and have fun. He brings energy to the game. And how he plays is so fun to see. Glad hes on my side.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think Jayson is just being Jayson. I dont think there is any pressure that he cant handle, on or off the court. But I think on the court, I think him being able to play-make, almost having a triple-double and being the best player on the court is what he does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Im pretty sure. Everybody was ready to go. Its been a long stretch before we had this first game. We finally got that out of our system, so now we should be able to play for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Of course. This is something that we can learn from and it can help us in the next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Not necessarily difficult shots. We just have to communicate a lot better and just be better in our principles defensively. Thats what's going to help us withstand the stretch of the runs they made.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, he looked pretty healthy to me. We have to find a way to match his energy and physicality."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,They mostly play one-on-one. They send a lot of help. So that's why.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Of course. You want me to say we have no confidence? Smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Of course.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, he was great for them. He was knocking down shots. He was blocking shots. So he was really, really huge for them on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Their spacing is great and they have a lot of shooters. So I think we have to do a better job taking those threes away.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Just like I said right now. We've got to take those threes away. That's what hurt us the most.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just playing our basketball. I think in those moments, we were playing our basketball. We were getting stops. We didn't allow them to offensive rebound. We were having fun out there those couple moments, and that's what we've got to do more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Obviously this is a bigger stage. But those games, Finals prepare you for this moment. We pass Game 1. We didn't do our job well. So we've got to focus on the second one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just focus on the next game. I think we really got good shots. We just didn't make them. But we've got to go game by game. The Game 1 is over. We've got to watch film, what we did wrong, and focus only on the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, obviously, I think they are the best three-point shooting team in the NBA, so sometimes really hard to take those away. Especially when they have five guys out and they can all shoot. Obviously, we've got to make more. We didn't make enough shots today to beat them. But we've got to be better on both ends."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it's a full-team effort. Luka still had 30 and 10, so I got to do a better job. But it's a full-team effort and tonight I got lucky a few times, but we got to get ready for Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think defensively I thought we were -- we made some big-time plays. When they cut it to eight, that's when the game started. I liked how our team responded. We stayed composed. Offensively, we got to our spacing and was able to push that lead back out and make some plays on offense. That was a big third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"What was I feeling? Just trying to make some plays, get my team going. Defense is what we got to hang our hat on. Right there, that was an example of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It just depends. It just depends on who you're on, it just depends on the spacing of the game, and we got to be able to make plays, and right there, it was just -- I was the low guy, I was on some of those bigs, you don't want to give up lobs. That's one thing that we made an emphasis on. So I don't want to step up too much and give those lobs, but I was able to cat and mouse a little bit and then make some plays at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the game right there. It's going to be -- it's not going to be perfect. It's a long series. I expect them Game 2 to come out with tremendous force and maybe try to hit us in the mouth. So that's the game. When a team goes on a run, you got to manage it, you got to stay composed, and you got to keep playing basketball. It's almost like you just have short-term memory a little bit, like the team's not even on a run. You got to play smart basketball and make great plays to get us on a -- get our flow back, and I think in that third quarter, I got to the free-throw line. I think that helped us get going. Then we made some kickouts to the corner. Al got a three. We was able to get some good offense going. But getting into that paint, being solid, being composed was what allowed us to push that lead back out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"We just said, just breathe. The game is starting now. Just breathe. We're in -- this is a moment where our experience shines through. Just breathe, just keep playing basketball. If you got a shot that's open, take it with confidence, no turnovers, take care of the basketball and just play our game. We got to get some stops. They made some big shots. Just navigate the run. That was it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Two great additions between Kristaps and Jrue. In any given night it could be any of us. And Kristaps had a monster game for us and just his presence shooting the ball and then him being able to attack those switches and mismatches, he made 'em pay every time, and that's what we need going forward in the series. Kristaps was big, but those other guys, Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, JT, they all can get going at any point in time, so that's the beauty of our team. Every game has its own story. We just got to stay ready, stay composed, and take it one game at a time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yes, I think Kristaps has been great for us all season long. I think he's a big reason why we've been the best team in basketball record-wise, at least, and having him back and him playing well and to that level he was during the season is so important for us because you got another defender, another shooter, out there that you have to respect. So that just opens it up for everybody else. Now, next game, I'm sure they will make adjustments. We got to be able to read it on the fly and make plays. Guys got to step up. We need guys like Sam, Payton, to come in and step up, JT. Everybody got to be ready to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,It means nothing. You just get ready for the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just trying to get to the paint. You know, get paint threats. That creates openness for our shooters. Just get to the throw free-throw line, take my time, and knock 'em down, and clean it up for the next game. But overall, that's what I've been doing all season long, is just getting to the paint, and that just opens up -- that puts a lot of pressure on the defense. We got a lot of guys that can shoot the ball. Making those reads and stuff is big for us, so got to continue to maintain that throughout the season, throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It was amazing. Nobody's more proud and more excited for him than I am. But we got to get better, we got to, you know, almost forget about it and get ready for the next one. We can't be celebrating ourselves. Dallas is probably getting ready for the next game right now, so we got to prepare and get ready for the next one, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, was it the first or second quarter? He just went on a run where he just, he hit the three, hit the middy, then ran back, got the block at the rim in transition. He was just making play after play and it was just like, all right, he's back, there was no question about it then. We need some more that have going forward for the rest of this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,They're two of the most talented guards this league has seen. It's going to be a challenge for all of us. It's not going to be one-on-one we all have to participate. They're two of the best this league has ever seen. It's going to be a lot of fun. Just have to embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,Pray they miss laughter. They're special. They make tough shots. You just got to try to make it difficult for them for 48 minutes and embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"You got to know the personnel. You're just competing. We've been switching a lot all year. Whoever has that challenge, just got to know that it's not just you on an island we're all going to be there behind them. Just embracing that challenge, competing and trying to make it as difficult as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, obviously there's a lot of history between the two. I think once we get in between the lines and the game starts, it's just going to be a competitive game. We're just going to go out there and compete. I know he's going to do the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think at the time we didn't have anybody who had any Finals experience. So obviously we've learned a lot from that Finals a couple years ago. Obviously adding KP and Jrue, all the experience they have. I think it's going to be different. Everybody is looking forward to it and embracing the challenge. This is the NBA Finals, it's what you dream about. It's going to be a challenge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think everybody's excited, honestly. It's been a long break. A good week of practice. Everybody is looking forward to it. Like I said, this is what you dream about. Whatever it takes we got to be willing to do. We've been working for this moment the whole season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,Yeah. It's going to be here tomorrow. It's going to be fun. There's going to be a lot going on. A big challenge and have fun with it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We didn't want to skip any steps the whole season. Obviously, the outside noise is going to be there no matter what we do. So this whole year we didn't want to skip steps. I think we did a really good job of that in the regular season and the postseason. Just continue to take it one day at a time, one game at a time. Just understand there are going to be ups, there's going to be downs. Just embrace it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, you're here, you see all the banners, all the history. It's in our practice facility. You just dream about being part of that. Obviously the great history that the Celtics have. I think we all just embraced it and are thankful and grateful to be a part of this organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"This is what it's all about here in Boston, this stage, this moment. We understand the challenges of it. We're just looking forward to it. We're going to have fun. There's going to be ups, there's going to be downs. We may lose, but we got to go out there and compete each and every night. Whatever it takes to get four wins."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's crazy. This is like the biggest stage in basketball. To reach this point, have the opportunity to come out here and perform and help my team win the championship, it's an honor. Hopefully we can get it done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I would have the belief in myself that I could do it. I always dreamed of being in the NBA. I knew I worked really hard to make it. So I guess in a way, yeah, I believed in it. It's the only reason I would work every day like I did, I had the belief in that dream, so yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I wasn't here when Kyrie was here but there's no bad blood. I think a lot of the guys that played with him have admired the way he plays the game. I definitely admire it, too. I take a lot of things. The way he plays basketball is very beautiful. He's an unbelievable player. There is no bad blood from us at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think it's the nature of Boston and the NBA. When a player leaves like that, fans and people can be frustrated. I think at this point we should just realize how good of a player he is and just give him his flowers for that aspect of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just helps that you've been through it. I think the difference this year, too, is we got a little bit more rest going into this series than the last time we were in the Finals. Just kind of the circus with the NBA Finals, the media, everything that comes with it. So just going through it realizing what the routine is going to be like. That helps. Just in the basketball game, I don't think it's any different necessarily than the playoff series we played before. Same thing, we getting up and down. Definitely helps, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think we have to realize they're unbelievable players, and we're going to try to make things very tough for them. You're never going to completely stop them. We're going to do our best."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"That's easy. The reason I fell in love with basketball in the first place is I watched Dwyane Wade win his first NBA Finals versus the Mavericks. I was really young at the time, I might have been seven, something like that. I can vividly remember watching them come back and how incredible he was that series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a huge moment. It's an honor. It's a blessing. It's one of those things you dream about, think about every preseason, every season, every postseason, every offseason. To be here now, it's something special. But just got to stay locked into the moment to be successful."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a special place to play, especially an NBA Finals. I know the energy is going to be insane. Their fan base is one of the best, for sure. They're going to support their team. We're going to feed off the energy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,There might have been a few moments when I dreamed of the future to come back here like this. It's cool to be back here. Back then was a whirlwind. I was trying to survive.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"He's a special player. Presence around the rim defensively, obviously can shoot from very deep. With his height, it's hard. Adds an element to those guys that we can definitely key in on and take into account. Scoring threat. As far as his time with us, we're going to compete. At the end of the day, we are good friends, have a good relationship. Looking forward to battling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,I'm not sure which story you're talking about.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"Very brief. I think he's wearing the 77 very well. For a guy like him, I think it's very fitting to have a unique number. As one of the most unique players this league has seen, this game has seen, for him to have the number that kind of stands on its own, it's very fitting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Feeling good. It was a long road to get to this point for me. But feeling good. Looking forward to today's practice, moving around a little bit more, then being ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Of course, of course. Burns inside of me, you know, not being able to be out there. But tomorrow finally I'll get the chance and I'm excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, no, not cautious. I mean, no. I've came back from multiple injuries. I've had these first games back, of course not at this stage. At the end it's just basketball. Of course, the intensity is a little bit higher. I have to go out there and play like it's a basketball game, an important basketball game, and that's it. I don't need to think too much or, yeah, overthink. Just go out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, I'll play tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, it's good. It's always been good. Yeah, as I said, he's one of the best players in the league, in the world. It will be a tough challenge for us to try to stop him. Just following his career when he came in the league, already made a huge impact. I had the opportunity to play with him for a couple years, get to know him. Just knowing what type of person he is, what type of player he is, his mindset, he's a special player. We have a big challenge ahead of us competing against somebody like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no, I mean, I did everything, right? You have to check all the boxes to even get to this point. Of course, as I said, you cannot imitate the same intensity in practice as it's going to be tomorrow in the game. I have to feel confident to go out there and leave it all on the floor and expect that I'm going to be healthy and completely fine."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, obviously it's been tough. No, I've never felt like I'm not a part of this. I am a part of this. I've tried to be with the team, like, in any capacity I could. Guys so far have been, like, playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up. Al has been unbelievable for us. Yeah, I just look forward to add more to complete the mission."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's going to be goose bumps, for sure, especially not playing for a while, then coming back in this kind of environment. It's going to be special. Going to be goose bumps, for sure. I'm really, really, really looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not all of it was, like, not good, right? We had some good moments. We had some decent moments. Yeah, overall I think it didn't work for both sides. It wasn't perfect. But, like, I would say everything, teammates, locker room, I know at that time there were some rumors there's like something in the locker room. It was never like that. It's all just noise at the end. It wasn't just perfect for us playing together, it didn't work out, that's it. We moved on. There's no, like, ill will from their side, for sure from my side. I don't think there should be. Just didn't work out. But I have nothing but love for Dallas and for the teammates and for everybody there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think he makes everyone's life easier. One, because of who he is as a person, the type of character he has. Your franchise player has to be a cornerstone of what you do. It starts with his high character, the way he carries himself, who he is as a dad, who he is as a teammate. His availability. He's there for every single practice, every single game. Loves being coached. Just carries himself the best way. There's no one like him. He's great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Right away. I think just all he cares about is winning. He's used the experiences he's had around the league. He's seen a lot, he's seen it all. He's seen success. He's seen tough times. He knows what the league is all about. I think at this point in his career, winning is the most important thing. But it's both sides, right? He had to do his part to fit in, but we had to do our part as a team, guys that have been here before, meet him where he's at because of his ability to play at such a high level. So I think it was just both."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think it's more like the things that lead to success are the same. You're in locker rooms, regardless of the sport, even if you're in a company, everybody is saying the same thing. The things that go into winning, the things that go into success Toughness, togetherness, connectivity, the mindset you bring. It's all the same. It's just a matter of getting the right group of people in the right spots, then just working to feed that mentality every single day. You can learn from anything and everything. You're trying to stay as open-minded as you can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, every year he just has the open-mindedness to get better. So if you have that, you're naturally going to be different. But also, like, from the first time we were there, he's been through other stuff. He's been through success, we've been through failures, we've won, lost, had pain, triumph. You use the things you've been through every single year to make yourself better on and off the court. That's kind of where we're all at as a team, using those goods and bads to use us for where we are right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he can process information. He can process situational basketball. He has an awareness of what's going on on the court. He has innate ability to communicate that in real-time because of his ability to just kind of take that all in. Who has the ball, who has the matchup, where is the help, what's the spacing, who can you help off of, when can you make a play. He has great instincts. That allows him to communicate at all times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I would say this is not the end of the journey. The journey is for however long you're alive. This is just one piece to that. Regardless of what happens you got to wake up the next day and do your job. The journey will forever be there. You're just ready for it. You do everything within your control to prepare for it, mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. Tomorrow you just get after it. The game, the environment will tell us what we need to focus on, what we need to get better on and what we need to do. The most important thing is staying on a even keel and staying with poise. I think that's something our team has done a good job of doing all year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I had a good seat, great perspective in that. I think the biggest thing you learn is what goes into winning in the NBA Finals is the same as the last series, series before that, regular season, preseason, practice, training camp. It's the details, the execution, the ability to take your mindset and your body to the next level. The toughest team will win. The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different. The biggest thing we took as we were going through that series against the Warriors, the things we kept coming back to were the things we kept talking about the entire year - the margins, details, fundamentals, the way you go about executing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's not the only moment that those guys are using to get better. The coolest thing about where Jaylen has been is his surrender to anything external and the most important thing is his growth and development as a person and as a player. That's all he cares about, is getting better. I think that's been really cool to see. I think it's the same for Jayson. You can pick numerous experiences that everybody in our locker room has been through that you need to be able to use for the situation we're in now. That will remain the same for the rest of our careers. I think it's all about using what you've been through good, bad, indifferent, to help you in the present moment. The guys are doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, unless they change the light bulbs in the arenas, they won't be any brighter than they were the last series. It's just sticking to the details, the things that matter, the truth. The truth of the matter is if you don't box out, if you don't sprint back in transition, if you don't pass the ball in a two-on-one, if you don't take away the other team's tendencies, if you don't know who you're guarding, don't recognize the spacing, if you don't talk, if you don't play hard, you're not going to win. Focusing on the most simple things and the truth, the truth of the matter is you have to do those things. You have to do them at a high level. Obviously the stakes are higher, that just means that the details are more important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, everybody in the organization is a leader in their own way. Everybody sets the temperature when they come in. Brad giving me my start, hiring me, empowering me from day one as an assistant, giving me some of the opportunities that he has. But also the way he carries himself. I've always had a lot of respect for how he went about coaching, how he kept family balance number one. How he treated people number one. That was always more important than whether there was a success or a failure. I think he spearheads the leadership, the temperature of the building, just as everybody else does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"A whole lot of trust, just a whole lot of communication. In life, you could think someone has your back, but you're never really going to know unless it happens in game play. You get blown by, you see your teammate putting his body on the line for you, makes you just want to do that much more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard not to, right? Got to be able to adapt to every situation you're putting yourself in. Whenever you're shooting, doing layup lines and stuff like that, you turn around, there's 150 people with cameras, all you got to do is just smile away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard to treat it like every other game because there's a level of urgency. We're more focused on each and every individual fact that we can, no matter if that's defensive coverages, offensive game plan, what we need to do to come out and throw the first punch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It's definitely been a journey, man. I feel like it hasn't even been a year, but it feels like three. I feel like I've matured, I've grown up, and I've grown a lot as a person and as an individual."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding I'm going to get them into their spots. Whenever they have three people on them, you just got to understand put yourself in the ability where they can see you, and they going to get the ball to you because they're always going to draw two or two and a half people. It's just finding little holes in the defense and slowly being able to not be as aggressive but try to get them open so they can get you open, and you're going to get your shots. It's not always going to be me, people in the corner open, people at the top of the three that's open. Just be able to move the ball and find the right shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It makes you play with a certain level of aggressiveness and freedom. You put your life on the line out there. You put your body and your soul on the line in this 94 feet so you can win a basketball game. We're talking about basketball. Are you going to go out on the court and be scared of anybody because it's a basketball game? No. I feel like there's a lot of things in life, a lot of fears in life that I've had to meet over this past year, and it's caused me to be that much more confident in myself, being in such a tight-knit, intense moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like the Boston Celtics has always been a franchise that has a lot of respect, has had a lot of talent, has had a lot of people come in and left their mark here. It just makes it that much more of an experience for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Their voice is law. If you're on bullsh-- they're going to call you out. At the same time, they have the same respect for you if they're on bullsh-- and you're supposed to call them out. I feel like they both act younger than me off the court. They're both joking, joyous, trying to put a smile on everybody's face. But whenever it comes to on the court, there's a certain switch that they turn on. You can see it in their eyes. The kill mentality, just go out there and hoop, go out there and get the best shot, go out there and try to be the best basketball player possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"It's not game day yet, but it's obviously very special to be here. This is what you dream of, just making it here. As a team, we have our ups and downs during the season, but we deserve to be here. We want to take advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Theres a little bit of a history, so I think it will be very energetic. But that's why we are mentally prepared. We just have to keep the composure, focus on ourselves, what we have to do. Play with the same energy that we had in the last games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"The days off obviously helped. I had a little bit more time to get treatment in and work on strength and everything else, also on conditioning. Overall feeling great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, it's the Playoffs, so there's limited time. You get back and get the amount, the reps, practice. But we did a great job I think of ramping it up before that. Also the minutes were kind of restricted, too. We tried to make the best out of it. It's not ideal, but it's what you got to live with. I think we did a great job overall of pushing with the right pace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think especially after winning the Western Conference Finals it's a thought that you have. Now its really game to game, you can't get too excited because it's a lot of ups and downs for each individual game, for the whole series. You just got to stay locked in and prepare the same way for every game, keep your composure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"No, it's just like to stabilize it a little bit, some comfort for the shoulder. Nothing to get adjusted to, or change. No big changes here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think every series that we play prepared us a little bit for that because we had other lineups against Minnesota where they had five guys that shot. I think we have a really strong defensive core now, with Gafford and Lively playing big. I think they're also doing a great job. Overall we have so many defensive possibilities, lineups that we can throw out there, without having big disadvantages. It will change a little bit because they play a little bit more five-out. Obviously, the rotations, defensive rotations, will be a little bit different. That's why we worked on it for a long time. Hopefully we can just adjust to it in the game tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"No, when you talk about it didn't work, did it work, I only had him for a short period of time. I thought it was going well in the sense of our defense, his ability to block shots, rebound. Then offensively we looked to post him up a little bit more than Rick Carlisle had used him in the post, which was strictly on the perimeter shooting threes. Both worked. He has the skill set to do both. As you know, in the business of basketball, there's trades that take place. We're judged if it works or doesn't work. That's just part of the business. For the short period I had him, I really enjoyed KP. Great, great on the floor, great off the floor. Did everything we asked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Again, his game, when you talk a big who can put the ball on the floor, who can score, I believe can play in the post. In today's game there's a lot of threes, not a lot of post-up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, you said that, Eddie. I did not smiling. We believe he's super athletic. But when you talk about basketball IQ, everybody has different levels. When you look at Luka's level of understanding the game, time and score, who's on the floor, he is at the head of the class in that sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think you do have to experience it. I think that's the nicer way to accept losing, is that you have to go through it. It's a graceful way to accept losing. But you do have to, again, go through defeat to understand that bad taste, how do you feel, how does it make you feel, to work on your game, to get better. There are times when you're just not good enough. As a player, unfortunately with the Nets, we played the Lakers, we weren't just good enough and we got swept. There are some cases that you run into Shaq and Kobe. You got to just take defeat and then move on. We did bounce back to come back. But I think you do. Jayson and Brown have gone through defeat. We also lost to the Warriors, too, that year. The Warriors are really good. But they learned something. You could see they're playing at a high level right now, winning 64 games, the best team in the NBA. To be penciled in at the beginning of the season, that puts a little pressure or stress because you're supposed to be here. They fulfilled that. But that tandem, they're playing at an extremely high level and we got our work cut out. But they've been here. Some of us for the Mavs have been here, some of us haven't. We're going to embrace that and find a way to hopefully win a series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It's simple talent. Sometimes you don't have enough talent. As I brought up the Lakers and Nets, we were happy to be there, but we just didn't have enough talent to beat Kobe and Shaq. It could be that simple. But nerves sometimes play a part, too. Just the human side of things. But at the end of the day, as much as we've talked about it, to embrace it, to stay steady, and to enjoy this time because you're not promised anything to come back the following year. To do everything, this isn't a vacation. This is a road trip in the sense of a job. We have an opportunity here to find a way to win on the road. That's how we're approaching it. This is the best of the best at the highest level. It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I did. Is that the first question smiling? Oh, God, I love it. Got to love this, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I have a great reaction. It's appreciated. There's a lot of gratitude there, as well. Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish. I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now. Definitely miss him. Playing out there, just making things easier, being able to run up and down the floor, just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air, as athletic as they come. Yeah, just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life. Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other. Off the court, our families meshing well. I definitely think about those times. Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him, some of the great teachers that have come before me. I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game. Shout-out to LeBron for that. Knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the future and getting this series started now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it is a fleeting feeling, to be real with you. There's so many peers of mine that have spent long years in the NBA trying to make it to the NBA Finals, Western Conference Finals, Eastern Conference Finals. Have gotten very close or almost struggled or strived every year to get back. I had a chance to do it in my fourth year, my fifth year, my sixth year. When I look back at those memories, never regretful of how I treated it, but a little disappointed on how I approached just that success. I wanted to be able to enjoy it and take a breather, really take in the moment. You're in the middle of a 76-year history. I'm in the middle of a 76-year history now, but then we were in years of history. The NBA is very young still as a business. When you ascend to this level, put in a lot of hard work, you beat some of the best in the world, competing with some of the best in the world. I looked at it as, oh I'm going to be here every single year. At this age I've been through what I've been through, been able to come out on the other side. I look at it as an opportunity that I don't want to take for granted. I want it to last as long as possible emotionally just because of how much it took to get here. These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship. So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that. I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader, accepting what I can't control, and what I can't, letting it lay to the wayside. Letting that go, how it's going to go, that's life. Basketball has been a great teacher for me, but life has been an even better one. Using those same principles I've learned in life apply to basketball has allowed me to connect to my teammates better. There's no silent treatment that's coming randomly throughout the year because I don't know how to emotionalize or vocalize how I'm feeling. Some of the things I struggled with as a young player, I've now been able to accept this is what comes with being in this position. Taking on the pressure. Then also teaching my teammates how to get through it. Also look them to teach mere. Just staying a student and enjoying the craft, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, shot out to God Shammgod. He's been imperative in just helping me grow, enjoying the game every single day, competing. I feel like he's just one of my uncles just from Harlem, New York, that's there to give me a little s--- when I need it but be honest all the time. Remind me this is bigger than basketball. Shout-out to God Shammgod. He's helped me a lot this year, been there every single day to help work me out. Also inspire the next generation. He does it in his own way. I'm just following his footsteps, just like other uncles of mine who have done great things in this world."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, I've experienced Boston twofold my first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, then being right down the street in Brooklyn, now being here in the Finals playing against them in a potential four-to-seven-game series. You just got to breathe through it. To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it. Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day. Then the first question was? Oh, playing against my former brothers. Yeah, no, I'm excited. They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best. They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more. This is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year of putting in the time to prepare for moments like this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Just really excited. Just excited to be in this position. At the beginning of camp, that's all we've been talking about, being in this position again. I'm just grateful. Right now, just trying to take this experience in of the Media Day, per se. It's just a fun time, a fun time for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm enjoying it. This is a part of it. I feel like the first time we went through it, I feel like it was a bit overwhelming, just a lot going on. This time around, I feel like we all understand it a little better. I'm very appreciative to be in this position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, just continuing to stay consistent in the things that I did, coming in, working out individually, doing our team stuff when we needed to. It was just for a longer, extended period of time. Staying really locked in. I think the first day I took a day off right after Indiana, Game 4. After that, I just continued with my routine, continued to stay ready, taking advantage of the time. For me, this time off, I feel like it's been good to get me as prepared as best I can for tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It's great. He's obviously a very big part of what we do. Just everything that he brings on the floor. He's a threat offensively. As we know, he shoots it, he can post, he protects the rim for us. It's just a really good thing for us to be able to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,I'm excited. I know I'm excited. I know our fans are even more excited. It's the Finals. They're going to be rowdy. They're going to get after it. 830 start. I'm just happy. I can't wait until tomorrow. I can't wait to see them bring that energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I think it's a thing. I think so. I think being in this position, this situation, everything we have to manage, it can be overwhelming your first time dealing with all this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"The good thing about playing for the Boston Celtics is that the expectation is always there. When I came here eight years ago, this is what I came here for, for these kind of moments. What you say is pressure, nobody is going to put pressure on themselves more than we do, more than I do individually myself. I'm just really excited for this opportunity."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I mean, I feel like he's looked good. Kristaps, he's more of a gamer. I know when the game comes around, if he says he's playing, he's going to be ready to roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"You do your best to stay away. Your mental health is probably the biggest thing, especially playing in the NBA Finals. But not only that, I mean, everybody gets scrutinized, right? When I was in Milwaukee, it was about Giannis not having enough help the first two games, whatever. The pressure that J.B. and J.T. have to take on is something different. I've told them this before, but it's really impressive how they handle themselves, how they stay professional, how they still come out every game and do what they do. Yeah, I think it's extremely impressive how they do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Pray smiling. No, I think it's just familiarity. Just I think knowing each other's game, doing your best to stay in front of him, trying to take away the things that will probably hurt you the most. Probably most of all having help. Him being able to see multiple guys on the court, making it look like it's crowded, making shots as tough as possible, even though he's a tough shot-maker, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think he's always been great, to be honest. I do think play-making, he's done a really good job, and that's something I never really saw from him before. He's never afraid to take the big shot. He's never been afraid of that big moment. I think making the right plays in moments is something I've noticed since I've been his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"One thing, the talent. I know sometimes talent doesn't always mesh together. This does. You saw it during the regular season. You've seen it throughout the playoffs, how any given night everybody is just unselfish. I feel like we sacrifice for each other. That's kind of what makes it go. Then I think it's just the will to win. I think this team really wants to win. I know they've been to the Eastern Conference Finals a million times. They've been to the Finals. They've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted to. Now that we're here, we want to get the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"He never wants to sit out. He never wants to sit out. I've played with a lot of players. When you have your best player who wants to play every single game, takes the game that seriously, even if they're banged up with an ankle, knee, whatever it is, still goes out there and plays, I think it shows a lot. Not only him as a basketball player, but his character, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not for me. I would just like to add to it. I think to be a part of history would be cool, especially a history that the Celtics have and everything that comes with it. Again, I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team. But to add to that is I feel like a part of the reason why I was brought here, the part of reason why I wanted to come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I saw something or somebody told me said they started from the bottom, literally at the bottom, now they're at the top. That's really cool to see, especially playing against both of 'em during the season with their previous teams, seeing their role, how it went for them, then watching them in the Playoffs, being intricate, huge parts of why their team is so successful. It's really cool to see. They definitely are energy guys. They're guys that mesh well with that team and really make them go. It's going to be a challenge for us to stop them."

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's pretty special. Trying not to take it for granted. Not everyone gets this opportunity. So just trying to make the most of it, especially being on the path that I've been on. It's been like a wild ride almost. But it's been cool. Just trying to cherish every moment. You never know how long it's going to last."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure. Like I said before, I just try never to take it for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"There's nothing like tangible that I switch out in my workouts or anything. It's just trying to stay confident, maybe going back and looking at highlights where I'm on a heater or something like that. Just to know that, like, I'm still the same guy, it's just shots aren't going in sometimes. It happens to everybody in this game. That's why you play the game of basketball. That's why it's a team sport, not just an individual sport. I try to impact the game other ways. Obviously shooting is the loud impact that I make. But I always know that water finds its level. It usually regresses to the mean. Shots are bound to start falling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Sometimes I just search up my name and watch the first couple videos that come up. Sometimes when you're in a hole or a slump like that, you just need something to bring you out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I think we're just excited to get going. I think, I don't know, it's been eight or nine days since we played our last game. Everybody is anxious to get back on the court, play in front of these fans. I know the Garden is going to be rocking tomorrow. We're excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, well, I think we all had a goal at the start of the year. We wanted to be at this point. I think each day we just treated it as its own entity, not look too far ahead. We knew we had the talent, but it's more of like we got to go show it and prove it. Now we're here. We definitely celebrated getting back here, but now we're laser focused for tomorrow. Hopefully going to come out on top this time as opposed to two years ago."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,This experience is amazing. I look at it as a blessing. A lot of people play their careers and never get a chance to play in the Finals. I would never take this for granted. I'm just super grateful to be here. Can't wait to get started.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Kyrie has helped all of us, those going through this the first time. He told us to just stay in the moment, lean on each other. We're all brothers. Just being there for each other. Stand together, stick together, trusting each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, that experience was super fun, to have the opportunity to go out there and play on the highest stage in the Playoffs, be able to perform. I was super grateful. I want to thank God for all of the blessings that He's blessed me with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"All that confidence comes from hours in the gym, late nights, just having confidence in my abilities. When I go out there, I feel like I'm confident in my ability to go out there and perform."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"I don't look it as an underdog. I feel like we have a bunch of guys that are hungry, I would say that. We have a bunch of guys that are hungry and ready for this moment. We're not going to take this for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"I feel like with the pace we play with, I feel like with our bigs, how athletic they are, I feel like we have good depth with our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, I think about it. I've been thinking about it every day, how these days just keep approaching. It's getting closer and closer. I'm just super excited to get out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, it's going to be a lot of energy in this building. It's probably going to be hostile. We already know what is expected. We going to come in hungry and ready to fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"This is awesome. I've dreamed of this opportunity as a kid, my whole life. It's something you work for. I think being here now, it's amazing. It's bright lights. I think the guys are ready to go. It's been our number one goal since the season started."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think the history says it for itself. Like I said, everyone is excited. It's one of my favorite places to play in the NBA. I'm looking forward to it. The rest of the guys are, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think we obviously respect them a lot as a team. They're a great team, coached amazing. I think everyone we faced in the Playoffs has been a great challenge for us. I think it adds to that. It's exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"It's weird, man. Looking back at it, it's crazy. There's so many times in my career, whether it's high school, college, it felt like everything was going the wrong way in life. Especially my first couple years in the NBA. To be able to reflect on this and see where we are as a team nowadays, it's super fun. It's exciting. It continues to motivate me. I still feel like I'm young in my career. But, yeah, it's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, I knew I'd be on it in like in 2K or something or playing My Career as a kid growing up, always dreaming of being in the Finals. But I think it's hard to say I knew I'd be here. Where I come from in Australia, Castle Hill, you dream of stuff like this. Pretty sure the little me would be very happy with myself. I would say I worked very hard to get where I'm at, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, the atmosphere is amazing here in the regular season, so I can only imagine what it's going to be like tomorrow night. It's going to get the adrenaline going. It's going to be exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"He means everything. Kyrie has been an amazing leader for not only me but everyone else on the team. He's competitive. Since day one, all sights have been on making it to the Finals. It's not only Kyrie. Kyrie is a great leader. Luka is a great leader. All the team has been so tight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Being confident and being pretty much prepared for anything, 'because nine times out of ten I'll be out on the perimeter a lot more defending. Just being comfortable in that situation. There's going to be times when I'm out on the perimeter, in the paint, protecting the basket. There's going to be a lot of stuff thrown at us. Being comfortable in that situation, being confident I make sure I make those reads and being able to rotate defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmm. Just coming out, setting the tone. We got a lot of energy around this team. We got a great atmosphere around this team. If we come out with our heads on straight, I feel like it's going to be a pretty good situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"What's crazy, when I got traded, we were actually headed here to play Boston. I got to the practice facility. Wizards General Manager Will Dawkins called me and said there's a possibility you'll be going to Dallas. I said, okay, let me know. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes. He called me and said, You've been traded to Dallas. I would say when it comes to the emotions of getting traded, you could be mad, you could be happy. I would say I didn't really have a crazy reaction to it because I've been in the situation before. I just took this as a point, one door closed, another door opened for me. So this is another opportunity for me to kind of like progress throughout my career. I just wanted to make sure I most definitely took the right approach to it. I didn't really want to think too much on it. Like I said, it's another opportunity for me. I just took this as this is another step down my path of success."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, man, the first game when we were there, Luka threw the first lob to me. The crowd went crazy. The Dallas crowd reminds me a lot Bud Walton Arena when I was in college, for sure. Just being in that atmosphere like that, love and energy throughout the arena. It's just something that I felt like I missed just throughout my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much the same. Go out and stay confident and comfortable when it comes to just like the position we're going to be in defensively. Offensively, not letting them speed us up. They got a lot out of veteran defenders -- Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, he's around the basket blocking shots. There's a lot of guys that are guards that can block shots, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Honestly, one of the best human beings to be around. When I got here to now, just seeing how he carries himself, how he talks. One of the best people to be around. He embraces everything he's been through, and he's found ways to just improve and progress from that. I've heard him talk about when he was here, transitioning to Brooklyn. He said he learned a lot. It takes a lot of just like humble and humility just to go through something like that. I would say he's one of the best people in the world to be around, because everybody has had some type of situation. You see me at my worst. You never pay attention to just like the progress of how I'm trying to better myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Because we are players. That's the main thing, in my opinion. Because we're players. We see him as a teammate, we see him as an opponent. At the end of the day, he is the same person on the court and off the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"There's a lot of great memories with KP. I always used to expect to come in and have a challenge day in and day out going against him in practice. He's one of the guys that used to always, like, motivate me when it came to the things that I did on the floor. I really appreciated him with certain areas that he helped me progress in. He helped me a lot defensively, too, guarding a guy of his height, a guy that shoots over you. You crawl up into his airspace, he still shoots over you. Finding a way to make that not happen was something I always focused on every day going into practice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's a little different because it's the middle of the day. Obviously, I remember growing up, I wasn't able to watch it being at school. I mean, it's something that everyone watches. I know they have watch parties all over the country. It's a big event and everyone watches it down there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, you could have asked me two years ago if I was going to be here, I would have been shocked. I think it's kind of the hard work and dedication that I've put into my game. Staying focused throughout it all, through the ups and downs, injuries. Making sure I always got back to just loving basketball, just wanting to be on the court. Obviously, when I got this opportunity in Dallas, jump on it. I knew we had a good team, but to even look at a year ago and say I'd be here, it's crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I mean, yeah, you always dream about it. I think just being a kid from Australia, even getting to the NBA was a big thing. More and more guys are doing it now, so it's becoming a thing that a lot of kids growing up look at it like, I can do that, it's not so farfetched. It's definitely something you look at, yeah, I did not see this. It's just hard work and you continue to grind every year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, we've been here during the season, kind of the hostility they showed toward Kyrie. They're just passionate. I'm all for it. I love it. They just want their team to win. It's going to be the same when they go to Dallas. It's just going to be a fun series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's peaks and valleys. The biggest thing I've done is try not to get too high on the highs and low on the lows. There were some very lows. I think I used everything as an opportunity to get better or as a challenge. Definitely going to Europe helped propel my game, build confidence, be a leader on a team of young guys. I think that helped me a lot, to get me to where I am today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know. I don't know why it didn't work out. We were still both young. We tried to make it work, but it just didn't work. So moved on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, his leadership is amazing. The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it. He's keeping us all together and motivated."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Some things he's done, I mean, especially in practice, it's insane. The things he even tries in the game, it's insane. I never seen nobody make those shots. I don't see nobody try those shots. Obviously we know the handles. Just some shots are crazy. It's amazing just to experience this live."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think we'll see how my knee is. But if it's a good, I'm going to go play, yeah. More games. You forgot, what was it, World Cup before the season smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Amazing. First time here. Hopefully it's not the last game. But never take it for granted. You never know if you are going to come back, so just enjoy the experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,I think it's very loud crowd. Everybody knows that. They been known for that. It's hard to play in this place. The crowd is amazing for their team. All I got to say is we got to stay together. It's us against them. We got to stay together. But it's going to be really hard to play in this crowd.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it speaks a lot. You seen more examples, too. But I think they fit perfectly with us. The trade made us a so much better team, especially on the defensive end. So, they're in the perfect roles that we need."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it was I remember it, it was quarterfinals of EuroLeague against Panathinaikos in Panathinaikos. The crowd went crazy. They started winning 20-0. Imagine that smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Well, I think it was, like, five questions smiling. I think it was great. Definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here. It's been great to see his journey, see where he's at, all the stuff he's going through, stuff like that, to be where he's at it's amazing, it's dope to see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, you learn and grow from your experiences, from being a 25-year-old to being a 27-year-old is a big difference. Yeah, I'm 27 smiling. You learn from those experiences. We got a different team. We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka now we have Joe Mazzulla. We had Marcus Smart, Rob Williams we have Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis. Different team, different coach two years later makes a pretty big difference."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think Brad has been great in his role as GM. He was a great coach. I think he just continued that by just being a great GM, being able to put the right pieces together and things like that. Just happy for him. His schedule has been able to settle down, probably putting a little bit less stress on him than we did when he was coaching us. But, no, Brad has been great since he's been a part of the Boston organization. He's helped bring this organization back in terms of winning. He's now been able to move into that GM position and put the right pieces together to get us back to the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially. I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of. So I would say a few times at least I've watched the Finals, the whole thing, all the way through."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Two different people. Two different guys. Joe's got his own style. Ime has his own style. Both were great coaches. Joe has been able to emphasize what we wanted to be offensively. We're with Joe a little bit longer. Joe had an interim year. Now this is his second year in a sense. Ime only had one year. So it's hard to really compare, contrast, to be honest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, D-White has been great all season long. He's been aggressive. We've empowered him. He's primed for these moments. We want him to come out and recognize when it's his time to strike. We feel comfortable with him doing so because he's been doing it all season long."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it's fair. I think it's a fair question. I think it's fair to say that it does affect you being embraced versus being scrutinized. One of my favorite quotes is, like, The child who isn't embraced by the village, something like that, you will, what is it? Y'all know this quote, right? You will feel like the warmth. The child that doesn't feel the warmth of the village will burn it down, something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, whatever. Neither here nor there smiling. But, you know, referencing that, you get to a point where it's, like, you get scrutinized enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal. Then it just rolls off you. For me, at least, I can say. I don't know if Jayson feels the same way. It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me. It just becomes another headline."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's a great question, as well. I think this is a special group. I really do. The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"It means a lot. It's a real testament to my hard work, all the time I put in in the gym. I tell myself this is where I want to be, this is where I want to play at. Being here is great. It's a blessing, especially getting here right now. Something I've been dreaming of my whole life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"I wouldn't say natural. I look at all the videos, but just a lot of trying to learn stuff. It's kind of turned into a hobby."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"I feel like now in the NBA you kind of have to expect stuff like that with the way that teams play, especially the way we play. We have guys, sometimes J.T. is at the five. Myself, as well. We can throw anything out there. Just be prepared, be ready for anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,I've been doing that for a while. I think college. I played it in college sometimes. In high school. Because I was always the tallest guy. I can guard one through five. Feel like switching up is easy for me always.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"No, that's always been in me. I love basketball. I love playing basketball. Before anything, I was a fan of basketball. I liked watching. All of my brothers played. It started from that. Now being here on the biggest stage, some of the best players in the world, that's just who I am. I love staying engaged. It helps me stay focused, stay locked in. It's just something that, for me, helps me. I also know it helps the guys out there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. My foundation is based in St. Louis. Obviously that's where I'm from. I'm very prideful about the city and community I grew up in and trying to impact and change those around me. Yeah, the initiative will start in St. Louis, and hopefully as it continues to grow and we get bigger and get more resources, I would love to expand. As of right now, it just focuses on single-parent families in St. Louis at the moment."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Individual awards are important. I'm not going to say that they're not. Everybody wants to win a championship, but you want to be rewarded for the work that you put in, for the things that you go out there and do on the court. They have individual awards for a reason. As a competitor, as a player, you grew up watching your favorite players winning MVP and First Team All-NBA and all that. Of course you want to win those things. But you can't take precedent over playing the right way and doing the things that you have to do in order for your team to essentially be the best team in the league and have a chance to win a championship. Would I love to win? Yes. But apparently us losing the Finals two years ago affects what people think of me now, so I guess I've got some ground to make up. Everybody who has a vote, they vote -- the criteria is different. Everybody thinks differently. Right, wrong, or indifferent, it is what it is. You can't tell people what they should look for when they vote. That's the beauty of it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, it's been great. Couldn't be happier for him. You see the things that he did while he was at Duke. That's when I first got to know him and be able to talk to him. Obviously since he's been in the league, got a chance to meet his dad, his mom, signed with Jordan Brand, so obviously we have that connection as well. Just a great person, great kid, works extremely hard. Obviously only in the second year, and already an All-Star. So the work is there. The talent is there, for sure. I'm excited to see where he takes it. Couldn't be happier for him. This is only the beginning for him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I'm not caught off guard by making the All-Star Game. I'm still very grateful to be here and thankful to get that because it's not something you take for granted, right? Only 24 of us get to be here every year. There's 450, 500 players in the league. So that's a really big deal. It's a special weekend. You've got the best players in the world. A lot of retired guys come around, and you get to see them. It's great for the fans. It's great for your family. So that's kind of my favorite part about the weekend, just being able to bring my son, obviously, my mom, and seeing all the retired guys I grew up watching and spend time with them. All-Star weekend is great. Very honored to be here. Look forward to making many more."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"What makes it special is just the history of it. When I was your age, watching my favorite players compete and play in the All-Star Game and make highlights, it was a very special weekend for me to watch. I can only dream and imagine of one day being able to wear that jersey and live out my dream. Five years ago, I made my first All-Star Game, and I've been fortunate enough to make it every single year. Just everything about All-Star weekend is special, and the game is super exciting. You get to play with guys that you're normally competing against. So that makes it different as well. You just get to share the court with some of the greatest players to ever play, and it's just memories you'll have for the rest of your life."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Always just follow your heart, follow your dreams. Never let somebody tell you what you can or can't do. If people are not laughing at your dreams, you're probably not dreaming big enough. So reach for the moon."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, he's having a great year. Unlike any other player we've probably ever seen. At this point, I think he, for sure, deserves to be in the conversation with some other great rookies out there. Chet Holmgren at OKC. I think those would probably be the two guys off the top of my head right now. Yeah, I love watching him play. He's going to be incredible for a very long time. He's having a great year, and I'll continue to keep watching him do great things."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"One change, that's a funny one. If you get a tech -- bear with me. If you get a tech for overreacting to a call and you were right -- if they go back and look, the coaches do the challenge and they overturn the call, that tech should be rescinded. You should get your money back. If you get a tech for overreacting to a call that was deemed incorrect or whatever, you should get your money back."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Laughter.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. And I think the league is in a great place right now, the amount of high-character guys, the amount of talent throughout the NBA. The fact that LeBron and KD and Steph are still considered one of the best 10 players in the league right now at their age and how long they've been playing is incredible. As well as all the younger guys. Whether it's guys my age or the guys a little bit older, with the Jokices and Giannis, or guys younger than me. So I think the league is in a great place. When LeBron retires, the face of the league, that's tough. But we win a championship, I've got something to say about it, I know that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,My mom. Easy answer. My mom raised me to be the young man that I am today. I give her all the credit for all my good qualities.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Kobe. Kobe Bryant. That was my idol and the guy that inspired me to ultimately get to the point where I am today and strive to be the best version of myself.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Hot take, I probably won't score 55 points tomorrow. It's a feel thing. Starting in the game tomorrow, you get into a good rhythm, get a couple layups, maybe a couple threes, you look up, now you've got 16 points, and it's like, all right, I might try to go get it again. I wonder who's the last person to win back-to-back All-Star Game MVPs? I'm not sure I know that. Russell Westbrook in 2015 and 2016. But if it's not going to be me, I might say -- maybe like Donovan Mitchell, maybe so. Someone from our team."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Just feel like he's athletic enough, obviously. I think a key part of it is starting, right? Probably going to play a little bit more than the rest of the guys. Is he starting? Wait, is he starting? Shoot, I might be wrong."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I had, like, 55 last year, and I think he was on my team. I want to say he might have had 40-something, so he was close. Mitchell scored 40 points. He's just somebody that can get really hot. In the All-Star Game, if you can get hot, have some electric dunks and things like that, you have a great shot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"It means the world. It means the world. I think the respect that I've gained from my peers and legends means the world to me. Just to keep meeting people where I'm from, that's not really a thing. There's no chance that they even know where Oshkosh, Wisconsin, is. So it means the world to me. I just want to continue to keep doing what I'm doing and gaining people's respect."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"No change. My goal is to play for USA until the wheels fall off. If I get that call to go, I'll be there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I don't really get into that. That's something that you guys decide as media members. I think we got a lot of different guys that it could be. The league is in great hands. It's the most talent that has even been in this league. There's a lot of different guys it could be. We'll see. To be the face of the league, winning has to come with that. Whatever young guy takes that charge and is winning moving forward, that's probably who it will be. Yeah, that's not for us to decide."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Well, I'm not on the team yet. If I were on the team, it would mean the world to me. Obviously I had a lot of fun with Team USA last year, and we didn't get the result we wanted. To be part of the team this year and have a chance at a little bit of revenge or a little bit of get-back, that would mean the world. I think, as a kid who grew up in the 2000s, I always wanted to play for Team USA after watching the Redeem Team with LeBron and those guys. And watching D-Wade's doc for them on Netflix, and I was at the premiere with D-Wade. It would mean a lot moving forward."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Going into the Skills contest, I have no idea what that entails. Looking forward to finding that out. I do think what we have over people is chemistry because we're all together all the time. 3-Point Contest, just don't choke. Last year I had a legendary first round, and then I think I got iced a little bit. That might be the reason. But I was terrible the second round. Just some consistency this year, and hopefully I can pull off the W."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"That's a good question. I'm going to say myself, number one, of course. Then I'd probably say Shai and Nickeil Alexander-Walker. I like their style, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"It's been a zoo. It's been a lot, but it's been a lot of fun. I've been told I'm kind of like the prom king of the weekend, so just doing whatever I'm asked to do. Coolest thing I've done? That's a good question. The IndyCar was cool. I'm trying to think. I don't know. I don't know. I did the little 2K League thing yesterday and was with Tyrese Maxey and some other 2K League guys. That was fun because I've always grown up playing the game. There's a lot of YouTubers there that I grew up watching, so it was cool to see those guys for, sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Wow, that's a great question. I'm glad I get to plug I.Y. a little bit, give him some love. Me and I.Y. hit it off right when I was in Sac, and we grew our relationship there pretty quickly. Obviously I got traded here. He was able to join me here. We spent a lot of time together. This is his first time living outside of California, so there's a lot of trust that he's put into me and my future and this organization's future to move here. I'm excited that he's here, and we're very, very close. Thankful he's in my life, and thankful that I have him, that I can call him a brother, but also someone whose basketball opinion I trust more than a lot of people."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Very critical. When I get compliments from him, it means a lot because I don't get them often. He's like my mom. Yeah, I'm always -- especially a play or if I mess up or somebody else messes up, I can quickly ask him to pull up the iPad and give me a look. You see a lot of times that I have the computer or something on the bench just showing guys just because he gets it to me pretty quickly. I know our minds are usually on the same wavelength, so that helps a lot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I appreciate the love. It's super cool to be on Chinese social, interacting with fans. That means a lot to me. So I appreciate that. I feel like that has a lot to do with me being first in fan votes. I know people see a player in Indiana and don't expect that, but the love I've received from my fans in China has been amazing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I'm trying to think. What comes to mind? Have you ever seen that commercial where the dude goes to the ref and says like, Coach, I touched this, their ball, and then the ref switches the call? Terrible. I don't know what brand that was, but that was awful."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"For sure. I'll be Chad. I'll be the sidekick. Me and Ant, if Disney wants to rock with us, we'd be down. We could do it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I think winning games speaks for itself. That's why everybody plays the game. That's why you watch the game. You want your teams to win. It's everybody's ultimate goal, and I think that obviously this year we've gotten off to a really good start in that category. I think winning games is the biggest."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I honestly try to stay very present, try to stay in the moment, not look too far ahead, not look back and kind of just take advantage of every moment, whether it's me working or it's me just being grateful for where I am today. I try to just stay in the moment, and it's worked out pretty good thus far. So I try to continue to do so."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I have no clue. I think that's your guys' job to decide and figure out. But it will be an amazing league regardless. Obviously, he's done amazing things for this league and for the game of basketball. You don't want to take him for granted, obviously. But when he's gone, yeah, it will still be great."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"For me, it's not any more difficult. I think I've learned through experience -- and obviously as a young kid it's easy to get caught up in it, just going back to high school and rankings and things like that. I've just found so much success from, not blocking it out, but not letting it faze me or control me. I think I've just learned through that experience and figure out what works for me and then try to run with it. To this point, it's not any harder, because I've grown through it being hard, I think, in the past."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It's amazing. It's a good feeling, just seeing the thing develop, not only for myself, but for my peers and guys that I'm around all the time and guys that are like brothers to me, just because we do everything together. It's exciting. Not only for myself, like I said. We've just got to try to keep pushing forward. Whatever's been working, just try to continue to do so and keep getting better."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Good question. I'm not too sure. Usually experience, the teams that have gone through multiple playoff series and multiple guys that have gotten to that level know what it takes to get over the hump and do so. That's something that, honestly, just has to come with us playing in more games. Maybe we give it time. Maybe we don't. But we have no ceiling on what we think we can do this year. We kind of take the same mentality and just stay in the moment, plug away every day. Where we get at the end of the year, whenever the end of our season is, we'll look back and make adjustments and try to figure out then. As of right now, we just try to stay focused on the task at hand."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I don't think it's a message to the rest of the league. I think it's a mentality, almost like a message to ourselves that the job's not finished, not even close. We're a little bit more than halfway through the season. But our goal wasn't to be 37-17 halfway through the season. We want bigger things and better things. Obviously, we're not done. So, yeah, I think it's more of a message to ourselves."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"He's super, super humble, a great guy, first and foremost. Really down to earth, easy to talk to, easy to work with. Easy to get along with. Then as far as on the court, he has an ability to -- he always understands what the right thing to say is. And the things that matter, he always emphasizes. When he speaks, guys listen and guys understand that it's something that is going to make or break our team. I think that over time we've seen his -- not only his development, but we've seen kind of his schemes and his work coming to life and really lead this pack and steer us in the right way. We all have his respect and appreciate him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I'm not too sure. I think no matter what there's like a fine line in -- like when it comes down to it, there's always a fine line in games played and availability. I think the league has the right intention in trying to make that line a little bit bolder and easier to make a decision. Now, I try to be as available as I can every night, not only for that, but just for the love of the game. But as far as how the rule goes, I don't really have an opinion. I'm going to try to be available for my team to win basketball games every night. If I can't be available, then I just can't. It is what it is."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Work on your craft as much as possible. Pretty cliche. But I would say be a star in your role -- that's also a cliche. I think when guys figure out what their game is going to look like, what their roles are going to be, and then attack it with everything they've got, you find the most success. I'd say that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"When I see those high-scoring games, I just think about the skill that has come into the league and how great these players really are and how great offense is always going to beat great defense all the time. You watch Luka's 70-point game, and he's making tough shot after tough shot. I definitely feel like someone can break that 80-point. 100 points would be tough to do in a game. You've got to make every shot and get a lot of shots up to get to 100. But I think somebody could get 80."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"I think each era has about six or seven guys that help carry the game forward, help push the game forward. It's more than just Steph and LeBron and myself. It's the James Hardens, Russell Westbrooks, Kawhi Leonards, Paul Georges, a lot of these guys who inspired the next generation of hoopers to want to be professionals. There's more than just one or two guys. You look around the league -- I'm going to miss a lot of guys, but you see Shai, Ant, Book, Luka, Tyrese Maxey, Tyrese Haliburton. There are so many guys inspiring the next generation of hoopers after them to become basketball players that you can't just pinpoint it to one or two guys. It's about pushing the game forward, setting a different standard, how we play. These guys are doing it right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"That's a tough question. You put me on the spot. If I had to say one, I would say probably Game 6, 2012 Western Conference Finals, up 3-2 against San Antonio. We were down 20 at the half at home, and we had to rally to get to the Finals. At 23 years old, that was probably something that stood out the most."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Because we hang out off the floor. I think that's most of the battle. When you get to know your teammates that deep, we almost to this point know what each other is thinking. I hung out with him a lot since I got to Phoenix and this past summer, and we worked out obviously. Hanging out, playing video games, going out, having a drink. All that stuff helps when you're trying to gain chemistry as a team. It's been great getting to know him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Same thing. I feel like we're both confident players. But when you've got that extra support out there to just go do what you do, sometimes you need that, especially when you're one of the lead guys on the team. You focus on so much other stuff -- your teammates, scheme, strategies -- and sometimes you need somebody to relieve you of all that stuff and just go play, and that's what we do for one another. Also, our coaching staff does that for us, as well, and our teammates. When you've got support like that, it just makes you a way better player."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Whenever Drake just wants to talk about life, I'm just there for him. And then he just gave me that title."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,I doubt I have an album dropping. I just do it for fun.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"""Hi."" That's it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"I think I've had great chemistry with every point guard. I think, to be honest, I played longer with Russ, so I think I probably have more chemistry with him. We came up together as 19-year-olds. We played eight seasons together, and he knew me inside-out. Obviously, I had great success with Steph. I don't want to discredit that. But I don't want to also discredit what me and Russ did, as well, as a duo. Yeah, I had great chemistry with every player, like Kyrie, as well, Book, as well. We had success as a team with the Warriors, for sure. But I feel like I had great chemistry with all of the guys I played with."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"I just want to keep being available every day, keep adding to what I did already. I never go into any day trying to accomplish anything. I just put the work in, and whatever happens, happens. Legacy, I just want to be respected amongst people that actually played the game, and players that are aspiring to be where I'm at, I want to be respected by them. And that's it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Some guys get injured, man. Some guys just get injured. I think the 65-game rule for the load management, but I think load management sometimes comes from these organizations too when they force you to sit out of games and guys may be injured. I don't know. It's tough. It's tough. I just want guys healthy and on the court too. I guess that's what the solution is, try to get guys to stay on the court. It's just something we've got to deal with. I won't say I love it or I hate it either, but it's just something we've got to deal with."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Every night my best player and my top fives and GOATs, I feel like every week they change. I feel like this last week right before the break Minnesota was playing good ball. Clippers playing great ball. If anything, I'd probably say Clippers and give it to Kawhi as the best player I've seen."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Yeah, I got asked this question three times over the last three weeks. My final answer today is I'll go with Steph. I just think the fact that you got the men's and women's game coming together to just help celebrate the game of basketball is always good. Sabrina is such a great ambassador for the women's game -- I don't even want to call it the women's game. For the game of basketball in general. Steph is such a great ambassador. So when we get them both on the floor together to shoot some basketballs, it's always going to be fun. I'm looking forward to it. It's a new event we have, and hopefully we can do more stuff like this with the WNBA, as well, and All-Star Weekend. So I'm sure they're going to put a show on."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"It's huge. It's huge. It's an opportunity for people around the country to see the type of talent they have at HBCUs. There's a lot of hidden gems there, great coaching, great talent up and down the board. If we can give them the platform to showcase their talents and skills, we need to do so. So I'm excited for them. Hopefully this becomes an annual thing and we start to see more and more talent come out of HBCUs."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Just a flat-out legend. For the Boomers, right? Boomers. He's been a constant for that program since I've been in the league. They play with such a toughness, and you know that comes from their best player, which is Patty. And then having an opportunity to play with Patty for two years in Brooklyn, I see why he's become such a legend over there. He's so passionate about where he's from. He's so passionate about just the culture itself and basketball. He's an extremely hard worker whose journey should be spoken about with some of the best. He continues to push the game forward and inspire a lot of people. That's what I love about this game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Just being around the greats. Even if it's a couple minutes, you can soak up some type of knowledge from these guys. You just get so much energy seeing other greats, other Hall of Famers, all the other champions in the building with you. So to be in that atmosphere with them is probably the best part."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",KEVIN DURANT,"Man, that dude can achieve anything he wants in this game. He's only getting more comfortable as time goes on. 20, 10, 3 12 blocks a game, 2 or 3 assists. It's just insane how dominant he's going to be as he gets more comfortable in the game. Luckily I'm on my way out, so I won't have to deal with it too much. You just see him settling in game after game after game, and it's going to be a joy to watch."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,"We'd hope that this stage and being a first of its kind in basketball, kind of the competition, the road map that Sabrina has ahead of her as an ambassador for the game of basketball, not just women's basketball, but how she handles herself, and just the conversation around promoting the WNBA, the NBA, merging our two worlds, it's going to be fun. I don't know what's going to come out of it, but me and Sabrina talked about how cool of an opportunity it is to do something that's never been done before in our game. And for her to have a presence on this stage is going to do a lot to inspire the next generation of young boys and girls that want to compete and see themselves in either one of us. Wherever it goes from there, we know we can kind of plant our flag as doing something really special."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,"There's a lot of guys to pick from in this group of 24 that are here. You see Luka, Ant, Shai, guys that are really coming into their prime, and they're highly decorated already as All-Stars and All-NBA guys, but have a perspective, I guess, of what that means within the on-courtoff-court opportunities with the doors that basketball opens in that respect. You've got a lot of talent to choose from in that respect. I think the more you understand the authenticity around it, and like me and Bron and KD, like the guys you named, have done it and tried to do that in our way, where it might look different for different guys. But the league is in pretty good hands when it comes to young talent that I think gets it and understands the magnitude of the platform we all have and will respect it as they come into their own."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,"It was a surprise, one. I didn't know Seth was on the trading block and whatnot up until probably two days before. The fact he had his homecoming going back to Charlotte, the first game they played, they wore their retro, old-school pinstripe Hornet jerseys, which my pops wore, and like you said, No. 30. It's funny, my dad said on the broadcast, I don't think anybody asked Seth or my dad what number he was going to wear. He just did it knowing it was an easy decision there. It was cool to see the Curry 30 alive back in Charlotte. Still got a lot of family there, and my dad obviously doing the color commentating for games. It's a family affair, for sure. We haven't played them yet, so it will be cool. We've got two games coming up against them the second half of the year. I'm excited about those two nights."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,"I can confirm it's the guy you're looking at right now. Trying to apply some pressure, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,"The first year we did the player draft -- the first year I was the captain up until the game in Chicago, it was the Elam Ending, that was kind of your peak competitive nature that kept everybody on the edge of their seat till the end. I think the guys had a different energy about them and definitely a spirit of competitiveness throughout the whole thing. Then it kind of got a little quirky with all the draft stuff that was happening. We talked about it a little bit in some of our meetings. It's kind of hard when you're here in the building -- it's very prima donna of us, but you're here four or five hours leading up to the game. It's so different than our normal game day kind of experience, like the way we prepare our bodies and stuff like that. So it's kind of hard to get to a normal level. I think there's a balance. We've talked about it a little bit. It's just coming with the right energy where everybody knows kind of the speed of the game, physicality of the game, and you can kind of make those adjustments, whether you're starting, whether you're coming off the bench, playing a little bit of defense. And kind of taking it from there wherever the game goes. I think getting rid of the pre-draft thing where everybody was standing around for however long will help. The East-West stuff, where there's a little more familiarity with your teammates, will help. Like you said, it's not going to be a Game 7. It's not going to be a playoff-type vibe, but it should be somewhere in between."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,"Like you said, talent is at an all-time high in every position. Shooting ability, scoring ability, different combinations that coaches are putting out there, like five-man units where everybody is a threat to shoot the ball. So the game has changed dramatically. I think there was that week or two-week span, there was a 70, a couple 60s and I don't know what. It was astronomical scoring. That slowed down a little bit. There's a couple rules, I think, from a defensive perspective -- I know Coach has talked about it a little bit -- where you could favor the defense a little more. I know the conversations the -- what's the group called that makes the rules? -- Competition Committee, thank you, that make those decisions every summer and try to adjust how the game is going, those conversations are always happening. I like the brand of basketball because everybody who is out there can put the ball on the floor, for the most part, can, like I said, be a threat to shoot. You're going to see a sway toward higher scoring, but I think the cycle of the league, it will reset itself at this point. I don't know how quickly that will happen or what rules will change this summer and the following summer, but I personally like the brand of basketball that's being played because it highlights the amount of talent that we have around the league."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,"Gui is an unbelievable person. He's shown in some short stints out there on the court with us what he's capable of. He's got a bright future ahead of him, and I know he's proud to represent his country. I've been to Brazil once, and it was way back when I was in high school. I told Gui, when I come back, I'm going to call him, call Varejao, call Barbosa and all the guys I've played with, and hopefully they treat me to a good time. They're definitely proud to represent their country. Gui is the next in line to do that. It's been cool to watch him grow in the short time he's been with us."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",STEPHEN CURRY,He hasn't shared that with me as much yet.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"That time I drafted him, the relationship, I had a big relationship with him. I appreciate him as a player at the time, and I knew the value he brought to the game. It's a guy on the All-Star team that you want to have on your team. I think that's pretty much all. Now having him as a teammate, I think it's unbelievable having the all-time great suiting up next to you and getting ready for the game. Our chemistry day by day is getting better and hopefully can get to a place that we can compete for the championship. We've been teammates for 50 games, so four, five months. Now, as I said, game by game, day by day, we're getting closer, chemistry is getting better. Hopefully we can get to a place that we can lead the other guys to the goal that we've set in the beginning of the year."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's always a great feeling. I never take it for granted, and I'm never going to let it slide by without appreciating it. From my first one until my last one. I'm happy that I'm here. I'm happy that I get to suit up and play, participate in this game in the best place in the world. I'm happy that I'm able to put on a show for the people. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to come to practice. The plane was delayed. I know there's a lot of kids that come out to practice that don't have a chance to go to the game to watch us play. I don't know if the NBA is that complimentary anymore. They have you pay for it, I don't know. But first time I was at the All-Star, it was free. As I said, it's great to be here. I appreciate every moment of it. I appreciate that I'm able to put on a show here for the people in Indiana and for the people around the world that are watching. Suiting up with the best players in the world in the locker room, you get memories, great memories, from conversations that I remember that I had, with Carmelo, my first one, and conversations I'm going to have tomorrow with Dame, Tyrese, Brunson -- all these players that I don't always have the opportunity to sit in the same locker room with. But it's fun. Every one that I was able to participate was fun, except for last year when I wasn't able to play."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Oh, yeah, that's my dad. Growing up, I remember it was a game that the best players played. I think my first memories of the All-Star was in the video game. Now it's the NBA 2K is big. But back then from where I'm from the NBA Live is a different version. I believe in the 2006 version Manu Ginobili was doing well. I remember they were playing East versus West, and I used to compete with my brother in the video game. That was my first memory. I thought all the best players coming to a game and they play against one another and it's fun. Then you participate in some of them, and it's been a fun ride. I enjoy it. I hope the people that watch the game enjoy it as much as we enjoy it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"First of all, I think LeBron is going to play seven to ten more years. There's no sign of him slowing down. It's year 21, and he's playing incredible. I don't know, he's probably averaging, what, 27, 8, and 8. Close. I don't follow, but I think it's got to be somewhere up there. I don't know. We have Victor. We have Nikola, but he doesn't want to be really the face either. We have Luka, Joel, Shai, on and off the court. There's a lot of people that can take his place after LeBron leaves."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"His availability. 21 years he never got hurt. I think that's the biggest talent he has. He's able to be durable throughout his whole career. There's never been a player like that. I think a lot of people have minor injuries, major injuries, and they come back. But he's always been available for his team. I think that's one of the -- first of all, that's one of the secrets that he's the all-time leading scorer, because he plays games, he plays minutes, he scores the ball. That's why he's been successful too. I wish that I could be as durable as LeBron. That's the most important thing. All of the other things you can control, from being able to shoot better, be able to post up better, be able to dribble better, be able to run the floor better, all the other things you can control. The things that you can't control is how durable this guy has been, how the way he takes care of his body. A lot of people work hard, but there's only a few of the players that recover as hard, too, as LeBron. So probably that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's fun. It's always fun playing against the best players. Now, if we are going to be in the Finals, I don't know, time will tell. Denver has a very, very good team, probably the favorite in the West, probably going to make it all the way. But we have a lot of work to do, talking about our team. We have a lot of work to do. Hopefully, if we get there, it will be fun. But at the end of the day, you've got to get there first. We have a lot of work to do, and it's very far down the road to even think about that. But it's always great playing against Nikola, playing against the best players in the world. It's always fun."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Oh, Jabari Parker? I love it, man. I watch all of his highlights, and he's found a place that he's happy. I feel like, when I played with him, whenever he was happy and he felt comfortable in his environment, he will thrive, and you can see he's playing really well. He had this crazy buzzer beater a couple weeks ago. He's leaned out. He's healthy. I'm just happy that he's enjoying the game again. Barcelona definitely have a good one -- good one. A great one. Great guy also. I'm happy. I'm happy to see him out there. I'm very, very happy to see him out there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I'll be honest with you. I don't watch basketball. I didn't watch any game of Wemby before that, and I didn't watch any game of Wemby after that. Not just Wemby, but in general, I don't watch basketball. Stats, highlights, how people play, I have no idea. And I love it. I love when I go to the game, and I have no idea who I'm playing and what they do. It makes it harder."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I really don't want to go there. Just never give up. Keep on believing. Keep on going. And be a hard worker. That's all I can say. I don't give up. I believe in myself. I believe in my dreams and what I'm trying to accomplish, and I know that I've got to work hard. That's what I've done my whole career, and that's what I'm going to do in basketball after I retire. It's something that's allowed me to be the man that I am today. So, yeah, be a hard worker, don't give up, believe in yourself."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I hope it can touch as many people as possible, inspire them in the best way. But for me, I'm just -- when I'm doing stuff like that, I try to be myself. I don't have in mind I'm trying to inspire. I just try to be myself. I try to be as authentic as possible. I understand that I have a platform that allows me to do that, and I have to be a role model for a lot of people around the world that look up to me. I try to be myself as much as possible. I was inspired by many people before me, and I hope that I can do the same for them. Not just for immigrants, but for a lot of people around the world."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be patient. You've got to be patient. They're not always going to do things that you like. Be patient because they're kids. I think that's the most important thing.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's hard. It's hard. This is my fourth coach in the span of six months, from Coach Bud, Coach Griff, Coach Joe and then Doc. Different philosophy, different game plan. It's hard. It's training. I am a student of the game. I try to -- when somebody asks me to do something, I try to do it in the best of my ability. I try to understand what we're trying to accomplish because, if I can understand it, I can also be there for my teammates if they ask me a question. But I love working with Coach Doc. He's been very, very successful. We can talk all day about things he's accomplished around the league. He's won, I think, 1,100 NBA games. Some people have never played 1,100 games. Yeah, he brings that level of -- how can I say? A championship level to the team. He won. He's coached a lot of successful teams in the past. When you have that guy in your bench, you have to bring your A game. Now, things that we have to do to get back on track, I'd say, one, we have to get healthy, but that cannot be our excuse. We've played 56 games, which is a lot. We've played a lot of minutes. We've got to take care of our body, and hopefully we'll have a mental and a physical break now these six, seven days. Then we get back, and we are fresh, and we're able to go again and try to build new habits and play good basketball and try to win some games. Yes, it's been a very, very, very hard season for everybody. Not just for the players, but for the coaching staff, and changes -- it's been a hard season. But through it all, I think we can get it done. We hope. We'll see."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,"February 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Be a hundred times better than Giannis. He doesn't need to be Giannis. He's going to be Victor. As I said, I don't watch a lot of basketball. I haven't watched him play a lot of the year, but obviously when we are in the bus or in the plane, you have guys going, oh, wow, that's crazy. Then it kind of draws your attention. It's like what happened? You want to know because I'm nosey, I want to know."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE MAXEY,"Honestly, I think that the home team rigged this. I think we won the passing. They told me the lines were going to be on the court when we did the obstacle course, whatever you want to call it, and it didn't happen. We tried our hardest. Me and Scottie did have some mishaps. He dribbled the ball off his foot. I don't know what was going on with that, but that's okay."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE MAXEY,"I had a blast. I thought we had a chance to win, giving ourselves a chance to win, winning the shooting competition, and couldn't make a half-court shot. It happens like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE MAXEY,"Yeah, they start struggling. Once you start shooting them and you get a little tired, you get a little winded, the shot gets further and further, the basket gets smaller and smaller. Shout out to the other Tyrese. He made a shot."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE MAXEY,"I think all the support. My entire family's here, a lot of friends. A couple of the Sixers staff, organization, media people. It's just been great, honestly. I'm just extremely happy. I think it's a great opportunity for myself to just go out here and kind of decompress and have fun and get ready for the second half of the season."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE MAXEY,"Extremely different. But good different, though, not bad different. Good different. More people know you. I've done a lot more media stuff, a lot more appearances and whatnot, but it's been great. I've had a great time. I can't wait to cap it off and try to get us a W tomorrow."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE MAXEY,"I think seeing the billboard on the skyscraper on the building, that was really cool. That and then also I had a dinner with New Balance and my family, my entire family -- nieces, sisters, my dad, my mom, my grandma. That's amazing to me because it's a family. They've done a lot for me and my family as well. To do that and have that family moment, that was great."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE MAXEY,"It is. It's great. We really tried to come out here and redeem ourselves from our Rising Stars performance, which I think we did, honestly. We made some big shots, but we just weren't able to cap it off with a W."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Felt good. There was a lot of energy in the building, and a lot of people want to see us succeed. Yeah, feels good to win."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",MYLES TURNER,"I heard a fan. He was like, Get two balls. I was like, That's a good idea"
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"They told us during the walkthrough, we had a walkthrough before, they told us about the first round. We didn't know what the passing or the shooting looked like. We felt like we probably had the best team chemistry just because we're actually teammates. So we could use that to our benefit."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",MYLES TURNER,"That's cool. It's a really glorifying moment to bring home some hardware. And being part of the All-Star festivities, off the floor, making an impact, and just seeing more and more people welcomed to Indianapolis."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"It makes it fun. Makes it fun going with them, and also the Skills Challenge is a good thing not only for us but for the whole city of Indianapolis."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",MYLES TURNER,"The energy in the building was solid, man. He kicked a lot of things off last night. So it was cool. I think it was cool just to be in that environment and obviously come out with the win."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"Number one. Number one so far. At the end of the day, this weekend is about basketball. When we're out doing basketball, we were able to win. This has been number one for me so far. I don't know if Ben would agree."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"Totally 100 percent, sure. TYRESE HALIBURTON Cap!"
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,That's crazy.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"We felt like there was a lot of energy in the building. We heard in our intros how loud the crowd gets, and that was exciting for us to be a part of. This whole weekend has been exciting for us to be a part of, I think we all can agree, being able to do stuff in the community, doing brand activations, all this stuff, has been a lot of fun. And good for people to see our city for what it is, rather than, when they come here, they don't really go out because we play the next day or whatever. They can actually enjoy the city for what it is."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",MYLES TURNER,"He's a dog, man. Some people are just born that way. I think he's naturally born for the moment. He's a competitor and a showman, and he's able to go out and do his duties. It's not just for show. This is him every single day. You've got to have guys around you on your team. It's easy to have consistent, reliable energy."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",MYLES TURNER,"I thought it was pretty cool, honestly. It didn't really bother me. I feel like I play a full 48 like that. I thought it was cool. Probably looked great on TV for the fans. I wasn't mad at it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,Great question.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I think it's exciting for us. Obviously, we were able to play in some high stakes, competitive basketball earlier in the year. Had a playoff-like feel. We saw how our crowd can get, and I think everybody can acknowledge, when watching the game against Boston, the energy in our building was second to none. I think that, as well as this and bringing fans out. We all have aspirations of getting to the playoffs this year and competing for that. This just makes us want it more. You see all the Pacers fans coming out to everything we're doing and supporting us, not only in these events, but our brand activations and stuff. It means the world to us. So we want to repay that by playing the right way and getting in the playoffs and playing high-stakes basketball."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SKILLS CHALLENGE,"February 17, 2024",TYRESE HALIBURTON,"I thought it was going to give me an advantage, but I missed. I don't know. It just wasn't my day. It wasn't my day. We'll try again next time. I think I'm going to just keep coming back until they don't allow me to, and eventually I'm going to win one. I'm going to retire after that. I'm going to keep coming back, and eventually I'm going to win one."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"That hurt. That hurt. I thought I shot well. I shot well all day. Got to the last one. I don't even know what happened. I'm not even looking at it. I feel like the science was there. You make all the money balls, and then the middle ones, I don't know what happened. I don't know if I made 2 for 5 or 3 for 5, I don't know what. But he made the Starry ball. I felt good. I felt good about it. The last one, the last money ball I missed, I thought just to clinch it, just to make sure he doesn't even have a chance. But it is what it is. I thought I showed myself well today. I shot really well. I think that people will respect it, I respect it. It hurt. You want to win. You want to win. I wanted to bring two home to Minnesota."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"It was different. I didn't really see it too much. I just was shooting. Of course, if I made some balls, it would have been even better."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,I appreciate it.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,I for sure went out and lost.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I appreciate the love and support. I really wanted to win and bring this home, but I came up a little short today. It felt good. I hope I made all the Dominicans proud and stuff, and I hope that's some inspiration for them."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"Yeah, I asked to go first. I wanted to go first just like last time. I wanted to set the standard. Like I said, I've got to watch it. I've only seen really the last round of my last one. I don't know, but I felt like I shot well. It looked good. I had a lot of in and outs. It was weird. I have bad voodoo in this building. Final Four, the only college game I ever lost was here. Just got to figure out how to play basketball here."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I was hurt. I was hurt. I already knew -- you know, you wish you could get some shots back. I just felt like I shot well. It just didn't happen."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I knew, once I got to that three-point ball, the deep one, I could win it if I knock these down and just give myself an advantage going into my bonus rack right there before that last one. So I knew I had a good chance."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Last year the final round was a much lower score to win. Like nobody really shot the ball great. So that one was fun obviously winning the first one. This one I thought everybody shot at a pretty high clip in the first round, the tie-breaking round, and the final round. Everybody like shot well. This one was a little bit more fun, I guess a little bit more rewarding because we had to really shoot it in to win. That's what feels good, doing it two times in a row."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think it's an advantage because you can see a target, know what you've got to get to. You're not shooting just aimlessly where someone can come behind me and beat this score. You either have a chance to beat it or you're going to fall short. I think that's the only advantage that it is, is just knowing. You can still go out there and miss. I like that advantage because I can see it and I can -- as a shooter, you have to tighten up and be sharp and try to hunt somebody down if it comes down to it. So I think it helped me for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I didn't prepare at all. I think that's the key to it. I kept telling Bease, look, the first two times I did it, I was practicing. I had racks. I was doing all this stuff and trying to get ready for it, and I went out there and just didn't win. Last year I went in there, I never practiced, never shot off a rack. I didn't do nothing, just showed up and won. So this year I was telling him, you're trying too hard. You're doing all this practicing. You're talking about it a lot. Just show up and just shoot. I think that's what's going to be best because, when you practice and all that, you're just constantly thinking about it, and that was it. But I didn't practice at all."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think it's easy to see the defense in the league, but if you look at the pace of the game now compared to how it was just a few years ago, it's a much faster paced game, and teams are also shooting a lot more threes. You've got a lot more guys on the floor that can make threes, that can make deep threes. Those things considered, it's going to lead to some high scoring. So I think that's what it comes down to."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,There was a lot going on.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think my first shot on every rim was either really short or to the left or to the right because your depth perception is a little bit off. You see a crowd in front of you, but to my right is like way out there. I can just see like a crowd way up high, far away. So it just threw me off a little bit. Then I just settled in. Then another time I was running from, I think, the corner to the wing, and as I was running, I was trying to look down to where the line is, and there was like some stuff going on. I might have just shot standing on the line. I probably didn't get all the way behind it because I didn't know where I was at on the floor, and it kind of confused me for a second. I don't think it really distracted me that much from shooting. I think everybody kind of tuned it out at some point, but I'm sure everybody had a moment where something happened and it threw them off a little bit."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Yeah. I mean, in games there's people guarding you. You're running around. You're a little more tired, and you still can get into that rhythm. But as a shooter, sometimes when I'm working out, I might hit 50 threes in a row once I keep seeing the ball go in and it's the same motion over and over. So when it's like repetition, you just kind of turn, and once you get comfortable with that motion, it becomes an easy shot and you can get into that zone pretty easily."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR 3-POINT CONTEST,"February 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"My favorite thing, I went to the zoo, and they let me watch them feed the lions. It was crazy. Like I saw them in the cage. It was. They let me watch them feed them, and the lions saw the food coming, but they were still in the cage, and they started kind of roaring a little bit. I was probably as far as I am from you from the cage, and my chest was vibrating because it was just so powerful. It was like -- it was crazy. That was a great experience."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"There's so many people that came at me before this, like, oh, man, you should be mad. You want to be in the NBA. You deserve to be in the NBA. And I do believe I do. But I also think this is my human experience, and I think it's my human experience for a reason because, without this grind and struggle, I probably wouldn't be able to impact like I do and have been lucky enough to do things like this. So this is my story, and I've really embraced it. I'm going to keep fighting. I'm not going to quit no matter any other outcome."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"That was the backup option. The other one was a little better maybe. I won't tell that one. I know Chuck Millan is probably mad I didn't use the other one. No, Shaq is so cool to put on my high school jersey. Makes me emotional that he did that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"That's incredible they're doing that and letting us be a part of this and get our names out there. Yeah, it's been great, and it's a really cool thing they're doing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"I'm trying to sit with it right now and take a second and understand what's going on. I feel like life is so fast sometimes, it's just I'll look back in 20 years when I can't jump anymore and not as quick. But I know I'm a lucky dude. That's about it right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"Yeah, that was a shout-out to my hometown again. That's what I did last year. I wanted to build on it. Really the thought I was thinking was don't miss the dunk. Like, I can't miss a dunk. I don't usually miss. I think I had room for improvement, and I knew I had a better set than I showed. But I'm glad the outcome happened the way it did."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"What a cool guy to do that, man. What a great guy to do that for myself and my hometown. I think that just shows who he is now. Just really cool of him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"I think Nate Robinson did. Didn't Nate Robinson win three times? I don't know. We'll think about it. I'm not sure yet. I'll think about it. Nate Robinson has won the Slam Dunk contest a record three times -- 2006, 2009 and 2010."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"No, it was preparation. I told my parents the idea, and they hopped on it maybe five, six weeks ago. No, I was. Seeing some of the guys do dunks, and I was like, oh, wow. I got done with my first dunk, and it was okay, you've got to really bring something. I think they wanted us to make our dunk on the first try, which I completely understand. I knew it was time to lock in the finals."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"It's so cool, man. I think that -- like you said, I just feel lucky, man. I don't know how to really explain it. I've really enjoyed this organization. The GMs from top to bottom have been incredible and so hands on. Shout-out to K.T. Kevin Tiller II and Trent Pennington and Ade Adetunji Adedipe and Mark Mahoney for all coming here. They sent such a big staff just to help me, and I'm very appreciative of that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"Yeah, just a lot of thinking. I don't think I've worked so diligently on something so far away for a long time. I can't lie to you and be like, oh, man, I just came up -- it took a long time. I used Chuck a lot, and I used my best friends. Probably tired of me calling them at night. I was sending them videos every other day What do you think about this one? Is this good enough? They're like, Yeah, it's good enough I'm going to bed. Probably just bothering my friends and bothering Chuck and having a creative time with it. It was fun at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",MAC McCLUNG,"Not really, no. I think Jaylen Brown did it because he wanted to. I thought that was really cool of him and speaks on his character. But I think you want people that want to do it, that want to win. That's the biggest thing. I think Jaylen coming was a really great thing for the contest."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. I thought I had fun. I think that was what the ultimate thing was to go out and have fun. I accomplished that. It was an honor. At least I can say I did it at one point in my career, and I can live with that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It takes some energy to go out there and do tricks and perform. On any given night, you've still got to go and perform for your team. I think ultimately this media era, some players are afraid to make it into a meme or anything like that. Like I wanted to come out and have fun with it, and that's what I did."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, that's what I wanted to do. I wanted to be creative and bring some more entertainment to show at the end of the day. I thought it was cool. I thought the setting was great. I thought the court was great, the LED lights. I just wanted to be as creative as possible."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"No, actually, that's my first Dunk Contest ever, official. I've never done one ever before. That was a first for me."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Terrence was like my little bro. Definitely a Boston connection. I wanted to have a purpose in everything that I was doing. I wanted everything to have a message behind it, and I think that's what I did tonight."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, I thought that was good. I wish that -- I felt like the court was a little slippery. I wish I could have really done what I planned to do in my head or what I practiced to do. I still think it came out. The message got sent. I had fun while I was doing it, so I can live with those results."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,Whoever is the tallest. Wemby would be great.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR SLAM DUNK,"February 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"We'll see. I'll take it day by day. Today was fun. Regardless of the result, I feel like I was close, but it was fun nonetheless to get out there and have some fun, have some of my friends come out there. I thought we had a good time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, it's been -- I mean, the schedule has been full, but it's also what I'm here for. It's a lot of fun experiences. I'm looking forward to play in the game, two games hopefully. Next year hopefully the big game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"The Tech Summit, that was a lot of fun. It was funny. Had the rehearsal yesterday too. Actually learned a lot from these people who made the Internet world what it was today. It was a lot of -- I learned a lot. Yeah, about not skipping steps, I've been told never to skip steps my whole life, but that didn't stop me from running up the stairs. So yeah, of course it's something I want to be a part of in the future. For now I'm just a student of this league. I don't really know how everything works. Of course, it's something I want to be -- highly involved in the future, yeah."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I don't know. I'm probably going to keep that secret because I want to beat those guys in the season. Yeah, I'm going to keep that secret."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, I think so, especially if we win."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Expectations, it depends from who. My coaches and my teammates, the rise of expectations has been going on all season. It's no reason that it changes. So it's something I hope will continue as well with the years coming because I don't want to -- we want to be in the playoffs soon, and then we want to win. It's something anyone has to manage in their career."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"To me he's kind of like a mutant. He was ahead of his time and just so different from -- he made the game so different from what it was. This is someone I'd like to -- I mean, I would like to look like him sometimes because he was so special. Of course, not even talking about the statistical facts. He was just incredible."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"""Welcome to the NBA"" moment, there's been plenty of them. The earliest one I can remember is Kevin Durant was pretty tough to guard. Even though sometimes it feels like you've done your best and he still scores. So, yeah, there's been plenty of those."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"How different? The talent is just so incredible here, every team. So it's tough to guard because -- yeah, it's tough to guard. Yeah, those shots you've got to take are different as well offensively, the positions. Yeah, it's way different."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yes, how everything's getting better in terms of knowledge, the body, treatment, stuff like this, I think we're going to see more and more of those. Taking care of my body has long been one of my most important thoughts even for long term. But only the future will tell how the health is going to be. For sure, I'm trying to have no regrets about how I treat my body."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",TREY MURPHY III,"Cool, obviously. It was cool. Fun experience. Got to have a little fun with the guys, play against my teammates. So, always can appreciate moments like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",TREY MURPHY III,"Just to show people what type of time I'm going to offer Utah for Saturday in the Dunk Contest. Didn't want to do anything too crazy. Didn't want to give any previews of what I'm going to do, but definitely wanted people to see I got a little ups."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",TREY MURPHY III,"Yeah, I mean, the dunking thing came late, first of all, so I didn't start dunking until my senior year in high school. That was probably part of it. Then, too, just continued to work over the summer to get more athletic each and every year. That's probably what it is."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",TREY MURPHY III,"Always. That was always my motto. Just be patient and be myself and continue to work hard every single day. That's the best way to do it because if you don't, you try to rush the process, things aren't going to go your way."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",TREY MURPHY III,"That's definitely part of it. I feel like it started even in preseason. One of the first games I was back, I had 27 against the Spurs, and that was one of the times where I was, like, all right, I'm ready and prepared. I just kept that confidence, kept the same energy. Just stuck with my consistent work and just tried to produce."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",TREY MURPHY III,"Obviously health is an issue, but without that being an excuse, we just have to play together, play the right way and defend at a high level. That's the best way to do it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,I don't know. Enjoy my time off.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"A little bit. I didn't get all the way suited up, but almost there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"I feel like what I offer is very elite. My shotmaking ability, my playmaking ability, my speed, my pace, my quickness. I feel like that's definitely a go-ahead position for me right now. I feel like I'm bigger than that, but in the meantime just go with what I've got right now."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"I feel like it's good. A lot of good guys around the team. A lot of good vibes, positive vibes. Just great dudes all around."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"Really good. Ty is a good dude. Stays in my ear, tells me to keep going out there and be myself."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"It feels good to see the guys like that be back around at All-Star Weekend. Get out there and play with them and stuff like that because, honestly, we don't see each other a lot during the season. So just to be out there and be able to compete against each other and have some fun is good."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"Of course, yeah. I always set my goals for myself, and I knew I would be here. I'm just checking things off my checkbox. So it's been good for me."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"Of course. Yeah, just try to blend in, but at the same time just getting in where I fit in right now and just trying to be that spark plug for us and get out there and do what I do best."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",BONES HYLAND,"I knew guys on the team before, but I didn't know I was going. Once I got traded there, it was definitely, like, a lot of excitement for myself. I knew a lot of guys on the team already. I just feel like I could fit in really well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's got to be MJ, I guess. I mean, he was the best."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I wasn't ready for these questions. Laughter. Probably like Embiid or somebody, just because he's huge."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, probably would help with a WWE match."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I'd say we surprised people who weren't paying close attention. Obviously we're in a small market and everything, so we don't have the constant daily national media attention that some teams have around them. But the diehard fans who really watch us could see the talent that we've had for the last couple years. It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"First of all, it's a blessing to be here. I'm completely grateful. I don't take any of it for granted, especially knowing it can be taken away at any time. What's really respected in this league is winning. It doesn't matter what you do, if you never win at the same time. That's always on the forefront of my mind. With the group of guys we've got, if anybody is not focused on winning, it's kind of an outlier in our locker room. I'm not going to be that guy who is kind of pulling away from what we're trying to do. It's showing in the win column. We know we've got a long ways to go. It's always good to be able to look back on what we've done so far in the season with kind of a natural break we're having with All-Star break. But there's still been a lot of lessons that we've still got to learn from."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I don't know, I just always show up early to things, I guess. Part of it's also like I'm young, and I didn't grow up in L.A. When you're driving out there, you've kind of got to take into account there might be two hours of traffic. So just in case, I always leave a lot of room there just in case."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in. That was a big emphasis this summer, figuring out how to get my shot back to where it had been in the past and even better. That was a big part of it. I got to work on my shot kind of from the ground up, and when I got back to OKC, I kind of just continued that work all the way up to this point."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"He's a high-level competitor. You can see that in how hard he plays and the emotion that he plays with. He's a really good basketball player, too, so it's always fun to go up against players that are not only really good but play really hard. It really brings the best out of you."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"Always. Like I just said, it's always great to play against players that are really good and also play hard and have a lot of talent. It brings the best out of you and makes you better and really makes you compete. I'm excited to play against him, but also all the other guys that are in this Rising Stars thing. There's a lot of talent across the board."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I think it's always been an exhibition. If you really go back and watch some of those highlights, there's not a whole lot of defense until the fourth quarter in those ones. But it just comes down to competing. I think last year there was some great moments between, I think Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown where they're going back and forth with each other, just competing. I mean, it's friendly. At the end of the day, obviously nobody wants to have anything bad happen in terms of injuries or anything during the All-Star Game. But I think it just comes down to competing and having fun with it at the same time. A lot of guys are friends with each other from being in the league and seeing each other all over the place, growing up playing basketball. If guys have a little friendly competition and go back and forth, I think that would be great for the game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I guess dominance and stats. Yeah, put up a lot of stats."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,I'd say my post fade. I added it to my game a while back. I've had it in my game. It's a good shot for me. I feel like I should just get to it more.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I was on defense? I'd probably say like Embiid. And then ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, I mean, there's been a lot of good moments and a lot of bad moments this year, just like for anybody in the NBA. But I'd probably say Andre Drummond stripping me and making me fall on the same play. First game in the league, too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"First, I feel like I'm coming along great. Physically I've been blessed with enough luck, and I've worked hard enough to play in all 54 games so far this year. Obviously, last year I missed all 82 with kind of, I guess you could say a freak injury. I put a lot of work into my body and making sure that I'm in the right shape and strong enough, et cetera, to kind of deal with the night in, night out banging of the NBA. I feel like I've done a great job of that so far. Shout-out to our medical staff, too, for helping me in between games, get ready for the next one. God willing, it would be great to play in all 82 games this year. That's definitely one of my goals this year is to play in every single game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"""I can't believe I just did this."" I mean, getting into the NBA, being drafted, shaking Adam Silver's hand and finally playing in my first game. Obviously, there was a lot of time in between that, but those two moments were huge for me. I also understood that's just the beginning. Got a long ways to go from there, a lot of work to put in, but it's a good stepping stone along the way, I guess."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's got to be MJ, I guess. I mean, he was the best."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I wasn't ready for these questions. Laughter. Probably like Embiid or somebody, just because he's huge."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, probably would help with a WWE match."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I'd say we surprised people who weren't paying close attention. Obviously we're in a small market and everything, so we don't have the constant daily national media attention that some teams have around them. But the diehard fans who really watch us could see the talent that we've had for the last couple years. It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"First of all, it's a blessing to be here. I'm completely grateful. I don't take any of it for granted, especially knowing it can be taken away at any time. What's really respected in this league is winning. It doesn't matter what you do, if you never win at the same time. That's always on the forefront of my mind. With the group of guys we've got, if anybody is not focused on winning, it's kind of an outlier in our locker room. I'm not going to be that guy who is kind of pulling away from what we're trying to do. It's showing in the win column. We know we've got a long ways to go. It's always good to be able to look back on what we've done so far in the season with kind of a natural break we're having with All-Star break. But there's still been a lot of lessons that we've still got to learn from."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I don't know, I just always show up early to things, I guess. Part of it's also like I'm young, and I didn't grow up in L.A. When you're driving out there, you've kind of got to take into account there might be two hours of traffic. So just in case, I always leave a lot of room there just in case."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in. That was a big emphasis this summer, figuring out how to get my shot back to where it had been in the past and even better. That was a big part of it. I got to work on my shot kind of from the ground up, and when I got back to OKC, I kind of just continued that work all the way up to this point."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"He's a high-level competitor. You can see that in how hard he plays and the emotion that he plays with. He's a really good basketball player, too, so it's always fun to go up against players that are not only really good but play really hard. It really brings the best out of you."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"Always. Like I just said, it's always great to play against players that are really good and also play hard and have a lot of talent. It brings the best out of you and makes you better and really makes you compete. I'm excited to play against him, but also all the other guys that are in this Rising Stars thing. There's a lot of talent across the board."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I think it's always been an exhibition. If you really go back and watch some of those highlights, there's not a whole lot of defense until the fourth quarter in those ones. But it just comes down to competing. I think last year there was some great moments between, I think Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown where they're going back and forth with each other, just competing. I mean, it's friendly. At the end of the day, obviously nobody wants to have anything bad happen in terms of injuries or anything during the All-Star Game. But I think it just comes down to competing and having fun with it at the same time. A lot of guys are friends with each other from being in the league and seeing each other all over the place, growing up playing basketball. If guys have a little friendly competition and go back and forth, I think that would be great for the game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I guess dominance and stats. Yeah, put up a lot of stats."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,I'd say my post fade. I added it to my game a while back. I've had it in my game. It's a good shot for me. I feel like I should just get to it more.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I was on defense? I'd probably say like Embiid. And then ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, I mean, there's been a lot of good moments and a lot of bad moments this year, just like for anybody in the NBA. But I'd probably say Andre Drummond stripping me and making me fall on the same play. First game in the league, too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"First, I feel like I'm coming along great. Physically I've been blessed with enough luck, and I've worked hard enough to play in all 54 games so far this year. Obviously, last year I missed all 82 with kind of, I guess you could say a freak injury. I put a lot of work into my body and making sure that I'm in the right shape and strong enough, et cetera, to kind of deal with the night in, night out banging of the NBA. I feel like I've done a great job of that so far. Shout-out to our medical staff, too, for helping me in between games, get ready for the next one. God willing, it would be great to play in all 82 games this year. That's definitely one of my goals this year is to play in every single game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"""I can't believe I just did this."" I mean, getting into the NBA, being drafted, shaking Adam Silver's hand and finally playing in my first game. Obviously, there was a lot of time in between that, but those two moments were huge for me. I also understood that's just the beginning. Got a long ways to go from there, a lot of work to put in, but it's a good stepping stone along the way, I guess."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",SCOTTIE BARNES,"It feels amazing to be a champion. We put in the hard work, the effort, and we were just playing hard both games, and we came together as a group, and we won out there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",SCOTTIE BARNES,"Everybody played hard. Jose, my boy, he played hard. Everybody just played hard really. That's why we won. We just tried to stick to that mindset, and that's why we came out with the W."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",SCOTTIE BARNES,"It's been amazing. Of course, I knew a lot more guys last year, but it was fun getting to know new guys, seeing the young talent that's under me. I'm only in my second year, but I'm seeing those first-year guys, and they're really good. They're really talented. So, it's been fun."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",SCOTTIE BARNES,"For sure. I feel like I always have that inspiration, that motivation to try to come back as an All-Star. It's one of my goals, and I'm going to keep fighting every year for it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"My ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, I think was my first game. We played in Detroit. First regular-season game, in Detroit. I had a fast break and dunked over the top of a guy, and it was kind of a surreal moment. I didn't really realize what I did in the moment. But after the game, I just saw a clip and realized really what I did. It was crazy."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"It's exciting. Like you said, just having all these games after the break really mean something, every game. We've got to be ready to go because we're trying to make this final push. The break, just everyone getting a chance to take a breath and get whatever it is they need, whether it's rest, time with their friends and family. It's a great time to just take that time. So I look forward to getting back and making that push at the end."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"Some, for sure, have just said little gems to me throughout the season, told me I'm playing well and they love what I'm doing, stuff like that. Then once I did make the All-Star, guys definitely went out of their way to tell me congratulations, which is dope because not even really knowing the guys, just them coming up and saying congrats, it's just a brotherhood in the NBA, and I appreciate it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"Yeah, working out with him just showed me how to be even more efficient as a scorer. Like you said, a lot of pivots. A lot of movement without dribbling. When you catch, getting your defender off balance. Just being able to simplify the game and getting to your spots, that was one of the major takeaways I had from working out with him. It wasn't seven, eight dribbles. There was never anything like that. It was simple three-, four-dribble combos, pump fakes, pivots, turnarounds, all stuff to be able to rise over the top and make the game a lot more simple."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"It was great. We got to go there early in the year. The fanfare was crazy. I didn't know what to expect, but sold-out game. The media at practice was crazy. You could just tell how excited they were for us to be there playing. As far as the game, the game was super fun, super energetic. The crowd was into it. Every play that was made, they were reacting. It was a really fun game to be a part of."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"I don't really know him too well, but he seems like a pretty smart guy who understands who he is. He's the number one pick, so they're counting on him to turn around the franchise, and I think he understands that. I think he understands the pressure that comes with it. I think he's handling it well. I think he's playing well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"On the team right now? That's a good question. I like some of the guys they got this year. Some guys have been playing well. I think Jared McCain has been playing pretty well. I think Kyle Filipowski has a chance. He's been playing well. Yeah, it depends who comes out of the draft, but I'm always watching them, cheering them on. I like some of their players, for sure. Shout-out my guy Jeremy Roach too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"Coming into this season, I had just played in the World Cup. When we got done, I think it was like two or three weeks into training camp, so usually that's like when you get built up and ramped up to get in the training camp. Me, it was the opposite. I didn't touch a ball after that for two weeks. So I came to training camp just body like I've been sitting down, not really into it. So I had to kind of ramp up through the training camp, through the preseason, and that can take from two weeks to maybe a month. To start the year, I was kind out of rhythm, and I was kind of playing. I was kind of having trouble fitting back in, I think to our team, after playing so long with the guys. I think I also just -- the role I was playing for USA, I wouldn't say it clouded how I played the first four games, but I had to get back to who I really was, having the ball in my hands, being that guy. I think it was the first four games, that West Coast trip, where I wasn't really playing well. I wasn't even shooting the ball, just kind of out there floating. That Utah game was where I had to snap out of it. I went to dinner the night before with two of my coaches and had a good talk with them. Just wanted to come out with a clear head. After that game, I knew it was over. I just didn't want to look back. After that, I had to start getting the between cross and start getting back in my bag, for sure."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"I'm not going to sit here and say I'm a point guard, but I definitely think I can handle the ball, initiate a lot of things, create plays. I think I'm growing a lot as a playmaker, being able to set up my teammates. That's something I take pride in, being able to play whatever position is needed. Obviously, I know how my size is an advantage. So I don't want to get too much into staying on the perimeter. I want to be able to mix it up and always keep the defense off balance. That's something that I think me, my coaches, we always try to balance and work on is how much I'm handling, how much I'm inside and just trying to find that perfect balance."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"I wouldn't say it's over, but I think it's just changing. I think it's more of -- really it varies from team to team, system to system, how guys fit, what the team's running, how they use a certain player. I think like with Victor, I think I saw like a difference in his stats from playing power forward and center. So like when you're out on the perimeter, like I said, with my size, I don't want to be on the perimeter too much because then you become inefficient or taking bad shots. So you want to stay kind of around the rim, but also you want to be able to use your versatility to keep the defense off balance and make plays from the perimeter. Just finding that for me has been a challenge, just since coming into the league, because I think, when I first came in, I kind of just wanted the ball and wanted to dribble around and see what I can do. Now in year 2, I've been a lot more intentional with how I get to my spots, how I'm being used and where I'm trying to get to on the floor. Even if I do have it as a handler, I'm still trying to get to this spot on the floor. So that's been a big learning curve for me."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"Definitely the grind of the season with all the travel and the games, and the competition level doesn't drop off. Every game is a high-level game. You're playing against the best players in the world. So it's definitely grueling when you are playing all these games against the best players in the world. You have to be strong, and not just physically but also mentally. There's a lot on your mind too. So it's definitely something I've been learning and just trying to manage as the season goes on."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"Everything. Everything. Literally everything. So definitely going to finish out the season strong and then take a nice break. Definitely look back at this year, and I can set some main focus points to work on over the offseason and just grind those out to become a much better player."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"Yeah, yeah. We feel like we can beat anybody on any given night. We're talented enough to do it, and it's just up to us bringing that same mentality. Yeah, it's encouraging when you know that you can compete with any team in the NBA. I think that's what we're starting to realize. I think that's why we've been able to put together the last two, three months of basketball that we have."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"It definitely was tough for me and I think the whole team. A lot of those games, we weren't getting blown out as well. We were still competing. We were down a lot of players because of injuries, and we just had to fight it out. A lot of those games were losses, so it was tough just racking those up. But we knew that once we got healthy, we were going to be much better, and that's been the case. So it's definitely encouraging."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"Considering the circumstances of the injuries and what we went through as a team, I think we were able to fight through it. We started off 5-20. I don't know what our record is since then, but I'm pretty sure it's a winning record. So it just shows how much we came together and bought into what we were trying to do."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,"February 16, 2024",PAOLO BANCHERO,"It's just the guys we have in the locker room. I think we just all get along. We all want to see each other win. Nobody is out there with a personal agenda. Everyone is just trying to do what's best for the team. And I think when we have guys with that mindset and everybody is talented like we are, it results in wins."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"It was kind of weird. At the same time, I want to win. I hate losing. At the same time, I have so much going on that Im happy that I knocked one thing off the list for this weekend. Yeah, mixed feelings."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"It didnt feel like a game day. I enjoyed the first part, the Tech Summit. That was great. Great experience. New for me. The rest was as usual appearances, interviews. Its part of the job. And the game was fun, playing against those guys who are very promising."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Its hard to say. We can really see the shifts the past years, decades, in the game. I dont know. I think physical bigs are going to be more and more dominant in the game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Its a great energy. The organization is pretty good. I dont have much to say about the interviews its like usual. But the energy definitely is something, the dedication of the people who work here. Theyre doing very good."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I was tired even before I started. I cant wait until its over because I need those couple of days of rest to get back to be good during the season. My head is fine, though. Its not spinning. I set up the schedule with my crew before it started, validated everything. Once something is done, I forget it and on to the next thing. So Im good."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Im surprised nobody asked me that question before. Im kind of happy someone finally did, because I think he is one of the most underrated players and No. 1 picks in the past years. I dont even understand why. But he is someone that I think has a bright fiture."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Its great. Its a new experience for both them and I. Were all learning in this. Its really the first time in my life Ive been asked anything about shoes, really, because I didnt have a choice most of my life. So this is great. But Im still learning a lot about my feet and my own body."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, its definitely on my bucket list."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,"Just go in the gym and just play, really. You don't have to have a trainer to be one of the best players in the world. Just go in there, have fun. Be free."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,It was just within the flow of the game. I wanted somebody else to score the ball at the moment. That's the easiest way to get it.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,Not as relaxed as I thought it would be. It was a little more intense. We were playing catch-up the whole game.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,They feel great. I've been wearing KD's all year. I'm glad they were in my locker. I like them a lot.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,It was great. It was a different vibe out there. Everybody feels like they're the guy from the last two drafts. So just being able to go out there and share the moment.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,"I feel like I've been playing well on a very good team, and I feel like all the other teams and players have been noticing my presence."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,"It will be great because everybody is talking about the job's not finished, and how we're going to come back and have even more juice."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,Definitely.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,Go back to Dallas and just enjoy myself.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,Probably Rudy's.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,"Yeah, I saw Chet and Dub Jalen Williams doing their thing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,"I liked Chet's windmill. I don't know if I've seen him do that before. I was like wow. They're like, Chet got that? I ain't never seen it. Yeah, that was cool."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CASON WALLACE,"Well, I knocked two down. The other ones wouldn't fall. It was fun being out there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI,"I think it's amazing. Like I told people before, I started my basketball journey kind of watching overseas guys and how they played, how the team was more oriented on ball movement and passing to one another to get everybody into a rhythm. So to see a lot of those guys come over here now and be a big part of it, Wembanyama for example, it's just really cool to see that. To see the game of basketball be globalized and welcoming to so many countries, different players from so many different countries over here, it's great. It goes back to young kids, wherever they're from, they can make it here."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI,"Selfishly, I wanted to be a starter from day one. Did I think I earned that? No. I have high standards for myself. I wanted to win both games tonight. Obviously, we didn't. But I think it's just a testament to what I kind of put into the game, how smart I am when it comes to the game, just seeing things. Given my athleticism isn't that of others, I've got to find other ways to be more prepared, see things a little bit differently. I think I do that with my free time in what I choose to focus on."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI,"Yeah, it's everything but the scoring. The charges I take, lead the league in charges, the passes I make. The big thing for me is not turning the ball over, playing defense and finding ways to make shots. That's really it. Everything else falls into place. I get open shots from them. Give the ball to Andrew and Jonathan in space and let them play. Those are small little things to do to get your numbers up. Even though that's not really the goal. Just playing simple, making the easy play, and the game rewards you."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI,"I think it was very obvious the G League team brought it. They're playing for of a much bigger reason than just the game. The guys from the G League Ignite are trying to show they can be drafted high. Mac McClung, Alondes Williams, they're two-way guys. They're trying to make rosters. You could tell. It was evident. They played hard from the jump. All they cared about is winning. For us, we're happy to be here. Feel like we earned it. It was given to us. Obviously, the results showed. I would love to have a really competitive, like a real game. I only know how to play basketball one way. For me to be out there and be like it's whatever, I can't play like that. I think in the future, if we have that, especially Rising Stars game kind of sets the tone for the weekend, and maybe that carries over into the All-Star Game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,Leave with? Money? A lot.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"It's great. It's great for us, the Pacers. I feel like it's also great for the kids who are watching me, seeing me as an idol. Pretty much grateful for that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"That's a great question. I feel like the main thing for me was just to enjoy the time this weekend, seeing family, friends from home, traveling all the way just to see me and having a good time. I feel like it definitely is a great thing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"It's great. It shows a lot, having my teammates, like you said, having Tyrese as an All-Star starter, definitely is a great thing. But I was pretty pumped to see them. Seeing how much they support me and seeing how much they love me."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"I might have just seen a couple shots go in, and I was like it's a wrap. If I'm being totally honest, it's also my city. I have to make sure I bring it home. So that was the main thing for me."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"Just having normal conversation. Competing, talking crap, just having fun."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"It was fun. It was fun to see, to receive those chants. The Rising Stars Game, I feel like I haven't really gotten that feeling in the NBA. One day I want to be MVP, so it was great to have that feeling pretty early in my career."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"I had some soup joumou, a Haitian dish. I had a lot of -- I don't even know, soup. I had a little bit of Skittles, but that was it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"Sure, if I play, I'm all in. If I sit out, come back next game."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"It was fun, competitive. That's my nature. I don't just play the game. It's my job. I just don't play it to play cool. Yeah, it was fun, I'd say."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"Yeah, of course. I always like playing in Indiana. It was great to go out there and compete. Obviously my second year here, so it was great. Short, but it was great."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"Really just go out there and play hard. We didn't really go over anything too much. Just show up and go hard. I'm thankful to be out here. I thank my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ for the honor to be out here and show the gifts that He gave me, that God gave me. I'm just thankful."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"Go back home, see my wife. I'm about to have my second baby. She's about to be in labor any minute. So I'm going to head home and get out of here and see my family."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"It was great. It was great seeing her face. I haven't seen her in a long time. Obviously, what she's done for this city, just what she's done as an athlete, for the women's game. She's just a legend that will be remembered forever, for what she brought to the city. She brought their first championship. It's just great to be around her and see her again."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"I think for me just learning and growing along the way. Obviously losing 28 straight in a row, like you've got to have motivation to go in, go in and work every day. I've been doing this my whole life. Whether we lose 50 in a row, we can lose 100 in a row. I'm still going to show up for work every single day and thank my Lord and Savior for allowing me to play this game and to glorify Him with my gifts. I'm just thankful to do that. Over the course of the period of the season, I've shown growth because I stay consistent with my work. Just going to continue to grow. I've just got to keep sawing it and God gets the glory."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"No, not at all."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JADEN IVEY,"Always. I love playing against him. He's so competitive, and I really like that. Like I said, every time I step out there, I want to compete. He was competing as well. Like I said, he's a great player. He's very talented. I look forward to playing him again."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, it's like you said, it's a great opportunity to come out here and kind of just mingle with the guys. It's a unique platform, you play with people you probably wouldn't play with. You're playing in front of teammates you wouldn't play with. It's a good time to kind of play free. Win or lose, it doesn't really matter. Shows what guys can do and kind of puts guys on the map as well."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"It's a great opportunity to have fun and also put out a good product for the fans. Throughout the season, you don't get a chance to talk to a lot of these guys. There were definitely some dudes who I thought, I don't rock with this dude. He's kind of weird. He be mean mugging. Then you get in the locker room with them, and they're super cool. Shout out to our teammates. They were all cool. We had a fun time, and it's always nice to put a little extra bread in your pocket. So good time."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,It's probably both.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,I'd say it's everything.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"We're around each other pretty much all season. We kind of get to hone that even more playing out here. I was forcing lobs to him that weren't even there today, just trying stuff out. I think any time we're around each other and able to relish this moment together will bring us closer, which will obviously give us a good product every time we play. So it's a little bit of both."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"We were up a good amount of points to where, if I missed, it didn't matter."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,Because that spirals.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, that is true. We're up 10, it was doable for sure. But I like fake ran a stack play, so they could go under and I could shoot a three. I don't know if the team knows that's what I had intended, but that's what I was going to do. Yeah, my parents are here. So it's always good to have them around and just enjoy the festivities. You never know when you'll get invited to a weekend like this again and even be part of any of the events. Any time you can, it's a blessing and an opportunity I don't take for granted."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I'm not going to go like out of my way to just act angry towards people because I'm trying to beat them. Like I'm just going to be me, you know what I mean? That's not going to take away from my competitive edge. I'm still trying to win at every moment. But there's no reason to be over the top in any way, I guess."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,I think what they should do with the Dunk Contest is the four highest verticals in the NBA have to participate. So I'm safe. Laughter.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think some of it is -- I don't even know. I've heard a lot of stuff about doing the one-on-one tournament. I know there's a lot of logistics that go into that, like guys don't want to get hurt and stuff. I think a one-on-one tournament would be cool. That's an experience that fans don't get to see. We play a lot of one-on-one in the summer, which nobody ever really sees. So one-on-one would be cool. Everything else, I think Dunk Contest is good. Guys just got to participate and do the whole thing. I like the Rising Stars event we just did. I think it's competitive. You saw the way we were playing at the end. Winning 25K is a pretty good incentive to play hard. Yeah, it's fun. I think the one-on-one would be pretty cool, though."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"To me, I didn't talk to him about it, but usually if a guy is in his home city, if that is their intention, you understand. You don't want to be trying to get in the way of that necessarily. Ben's a great player too, so all credit to him. If he wants to go out and have some extra juice to go get that MVP, go ahead. We're going to support him in that. The whole team gets the bread if we win. If he wants MVP, go ahead. We're happy for him. Shout out to him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"They were great tonight. They came out from the jump, and they were hungry. You could tell they wanted to win. I asked a couple of the guys, and they were like, yeah, we want to win. I'm sure they have plenty of different motivations to win, and it showed out there. Shout out to them. Credit to them. A bunch of good players over there."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, they came out ready to win. They've got a lot of unique talent over there too. I think that helped the game too, just them wanting to play as hard as they did. They're out there running plays and talking defensive coverages. I think that added a little extra juice for us to play too."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,They were rebounding too.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, they were rebounding, running the lanes. It made us play hard inadvertently."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",CHET HOLMGREN,"I guess you could say that because, if you just do a normal format where it's timed and a team's up big when the clock gets low, there's no incentive to really start playing hard. Yeah, I think it's a good idea. I'm going to leave it at that. Good idea, yeah."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",SCOOT HENDERSON,"Playing with Matisse Thybulle, I'm just glad that we're on the same team because he's in the passing lane like nobody else. He's the best to do it. He's been on All-Defensive Teams for a reason. I see that now that I'm in the league rather than watching it from afar. Just the little things he does in practice and the little things he does in games that really impacts it. Against Denver, man, like three, four steals in a row. That's just like, sometimes he amazes me, and I'm like how? Only one person in the world has that type of talent, and it's him."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",SCOOT HENDERSON,"The first one I had shot like a fallback. I was like, he's definitely going to go for this. I was about to shoot it, though, but he came up so far. It was Chet, and he's pretty long. There was no way he could jump and get that far back. I was like, let's hurry, let's go to the rim. Walker came over and I tried to go around him. Great shot blocker, so I tried to go around him. Finish over him and things like that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",SCOOT HENDERSON,"I think it is the same. My first year, I was like oh my goodness, it's finally over with. I'm here. But my first year as a rookie, it's just a bit different. The fact that I'm in the league and a point guard in this league and a rookie or whatever. So just trying to go out there and have fun."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",SCOOT HENDERSON,"I remember not getting the ball like mad possessions in a row. I remember hitting a shot over my teammate, and that's about it. And also getting my name called on stage, and everybody was like ""Scooooot!"" That was my first time ever hearing that."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",SCOOT HENDERSON,"I think just learning all my lessons early was very great for me as an individual and as a point guard on a young team. Ever since I learned those lessons, I just try never to go back to them. All the film watching I'm doing with Pooh Jeter, Scottie, it's been great. Just learning on the fly really."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,It was fun. It was good to compete with the best guys in the world. Show what kind of talent I have. Excited for the future.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,"It's been a roller coaster of a journey for me. I work hard, so I've been trying to get the feel of the game for the NBA. I think it's getting into more of a groove."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,It's fun. It was really fun just to be out there. It's a blessing to be here for sure.
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,"Yeah, I knew it was going to be tough. So I came in with the mentality it was going to be a tough season for me. I'm still working, progressing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,"I've still got the G League Up Next Game. That's exciting for me. Just cheerleading, seeing a bunch of stars and seeing my family."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,"Just playing well. Consistency, playing well. That's pretty much it. Getting better every day."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,"I got the rebound, and I've been working on my post game, post fade, I feel like I can make that shot every time. So I took it, and it went in."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS POSTGAME,"February 16, 2024",MATAS BUZELIS,Not really a surprise. I've been playing in the G League the whole year. So it's always going to be competitive and a lot of good players everywhere.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Just is says a lot about our guys. Giannis at halftime, that's all we talked about is our defense. We felt like in the first half we didn't execute offensively well and we felt like we executed offensively -- we thought we had to win the three-ball game coming into the game. That was a big emphasis for us. We have to win from the three-point line. And we have to take them out of their iso game and I thought we did that, at least we tried to make Shai and Williams play in a crowd. I thought overall we did that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"I mean, a 10, right. That opportunity, you know, to coach a Giannis, to coach a Dame, to see that group, a veteran group, it's an amazing opportunity for a coach. This group allows you to coach them, they really do. They let you coach them hard. Nobody takes anything personal. I even said it last year, it was like coaching grownups, if you know what I mean. They really get that. They get that you have to tell them the truth and they handle it, and that's been great."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"We're competitive. Didn't for me but one of the guys, I think yesterday said, all they heard about was the defense of the other team. That's all they have heard for two days. I think that bothered guys. And so I thought that was part of it. You could see them, I think when they scored the last bucket, our whole bench exploded. They were mad. They were very intent on trying to hold them to a low number. That was good."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Yeah, that's not a bad thing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"I think it reminds us that we can beat anybody. And we don't care if it tells everybody else that. Like we only care about us. It's what I said in the first day of camp. Also said we can lose anybody if we don't play right, right. I thought we learned that lesson early. So I think it just helps the messaging that when we play right, when we play together, listen, that's an excellent defensive team and they forced Dame and Giannis to pass the ball and they did that. And then they passed it so much they stopped helping it and then those two got to work. That's what this is a teacher for us is different ways to win."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Yeah, it's great. One advantage we had, and again, we came in here and we heard about the old team and all the young guys. And we just kept talking about our size, and as the slower the game gets, the bigger we get. And that's what we kept talking about. You know, taking them out of transition, make it a halfcourt game, and it allows us to be a big basketball team. I thought starting the second half with playing Giannis on the elbow over and over again, so he can see where the traps were coming from, was good for us. You know, earlier in the year, probably couldn't have done that with him, and now you can. And it just makes us a better team."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Playing together. Going in at night, not drinking laughing. You know, but really, I had to say that because it's true and just playing together, hanging in there. You know, a great lesson for our team is a guy named Pat Connaughton. Pat Connaughton had not played in a month, and today we chose him to play in this game and he played great. The best part of it, he never stopped working. He kept preparing every day so there's message in there, too."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Yeah, we said that right away. We brought our secret weapon. Darvin Ham is now an undefeated coach in two years in this Cup and then when I said it, TP, he was like, what about me? And TP is an undefeated player and thats pretty cool for them because, on the back end of this, it's tough, you come out of this and you're back to the grind. This is going to be a tough little stretch. We have to figure out how to get through this."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"No. Right here. Right here. That's it. Listen, I was proven wrong in a very good way. I was worried that if an L.A. team wasn't in the cup we couldn't get enough people in the crowd, and the people from Las Vegas showed up. It was packed today and that's huge. You know, not only for Vegas but it's huge for the league and so it all worked out and it was great. Guys had a great time here. Restaurants, that's it. I'll stop there."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Its eat. I mean, look at me, you know, it's usually restaurants. I have a couple of them, a lot of favorites, I'm not going to name one. It's a great town, it really is. You can also shop a lot and spend a lot of money here. It's a good city."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I feel happy. Like I said, it was something we wanted to win and just being in something like this, the second year, I feel that teams cared about it a little bit more. I think teams played with a little bit more pride about trying to reach Vegas and having an opportunity to win at the end. For us to be back again and then we end up playing against a younger team, a hungry team, No. 1 in the West and they defend well and they do everything well. They have got a good team, well-coached. I just thought the way we played as a group and how we were able to do it was what felt the best. Everybody did their job. We defended. We played well from the start of the game all the way through the finish. I think it just showed what we've been building. I think it all came out in our biggest game to this point. It all came out from the film room to practice to us becoming a more connected team, the trust on both sides of the ball. I think it shined bright in a really important game for us. I think that's what felt the best. Obviously, the experience winning something. I've had a lot of experience individually where I've had accomplishments and stuff, but to have some team success and win something and be the last team standing in this tournament, it feels great."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I wouldn't say it completely flushes it because we can't get those games back. That's why it's important to not take games for granted, because you look back at the schedule and you look back at four or five games we feel like we should have won. I don't think you can flush it, but we've shown the team we started the season as is not the team that we are now, and it was never who we truly were. Just got off to a tough start. I don't think the tournament or the Cup was something that Giannis was just determined to win. I think that's just who he is. He's a determined person and player. Just the background that he comes from. His journey to becoming the superstar that he is is a tough one. So when you get to this point, you don't want to stop. You've got to keep fighting for your position and where you've come. I think that's who he is and that's why he goes about things the way he does."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think we just sustained how we started the game when we had success. We kept showing them crowds. We didn't leave each other out to dry. We were in help positions. We hit bodies and rebounded. We didn't give them second and third opportunities like they kill teams when they crash the glass. We got back. We executed offensively. Our spacing was good. When they loaded up on the ball, we got the ball out. We swung when we needed to swing. We attacked when we needed to attack. We got quality shots. Over the course of the season, we've had lapses over the course of a game. I think tonight we kept our focus collectively. I think because of that, we were able to run off with the game."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I wouldn't say a message. I would say it was more for us, for us to go out there and be the team that we know we are. If we go out there and do the small things, we play together, we share the ball, make the right play, we trust our scouting report and our defensive coverages and our scheme, the more we able to put that together possession after possession and sustain it over 48 minutes, a lot of our games should look the way this one looked, especially when you're not playing against an elite team like them. So that's what it is for us. We don't need to send nobody a message. We need to focus on ourselves. When you get on the floor, you send a message on the floor each night. You're going to focus on what people see, not what we're doing or nothing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think it's one of those things where people wanted to put me with Giannis and think it was just going to be perfect right away because we've both been high-level players. But I come from a situation where I've always had the ball, and he's had a decade of him having the ball and playing a certain way. So I think time is the No. 1 thing. It just took time for us to get to know each other better as people. You can't just trust somebody that you're paired with when you don't really know who they are, how they think and how they operate. So I think time has helped us. We've got a lot of reps playing in games together. I'm getting to watch him and listen to him talk so I can see where his head is and vice versa. He's been able to see that. It's just grown over time. You get to know somebody. You spend a lot of time around them. We spend more time around our team than we do our family over the seven, eight months. So you get to know each other. We've had a lot of dialogue through text. Vin Baker is always getting us together before practice, after practice, talking about two-man actions that we can get into that teams will have a hard time with, stuff like that. Then you get in these situations where we might be in a late-game moment and he'll see me come through for him. It might be a game where we're down and he'll start dominating and he'll come through for me. I think when you see how well we can balance each other out and I see the luxury that it is to have him as a teammate and he sees luxury it is to have me as a teammate, and as a player, once both sides see that, you just start to have more trust in it and you get confidence in it. And then in a game like tonight where you said the stakes are high, for us, nothing changes because that trust has been developed, and we've seen it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"No, I didn't think about it in the game. I was just thinking like, man, I was looking up at the time and I realized the game was pretty much over. I was like man, this is going to be cool to actually win something as a team. So I was excited about that. But as far as the money, I just was, you look at our team, we got a lot of young guys on our team. In the NBA, in my experience, I've been in the league 13 years now. There's been a lot of young guys that I played with that were in the league one year, gone. In the league two years, gone. Or overseas or they just don't play no more. So the opportunity that this is for a lot of our young players is not lost on me. What it could mean for them and their families and some of their kids. It's a great thing for them. So when it came to that, that was like my No. 1 -- that was my No. 1 thing was just knowing how much it's going to mean to some of our young guys."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, we didn't shoot it well tonight. It's not really an excuse. There was definitely controllables tonight we could have taken care of and we didn't do so, and that's why the score looked the way it does. We've shot bad and won games before, so it's not an excuse."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I felt like I got enough touches. Yeah, I shot 24 shots. I've shot less in wins, on other nights. The ball didn't go in as much as I wanted it to tonight, but I felt like I got enough touches, to answer your question."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I mean, they're big, so that's their advantage. Yeah, I don't think we generated enough force and weren't as sharp in the half court, getting freer looks to get in the paint. But at the same time, some of it is trying to get in there to look for sprays and have them rotate. That's some of it. But yeah, probably not enough force getting to the rim."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think sometimes -- I think for the most part, we got good looks. Like you said, when you're playing a good team, you've got to continually generate good looks and also make shots, and I feel like that was one of those nights. I think defensively we were pretty good. How many points did they have, 97? So defensively I thought we were pretty good. Sometimes it just doesn't go in, and you have to have enough will to kind of keep doing the right thing and moving the ball, and the chips lay where they lay. But it's just one of those things, just didn't shoot well. Probably could have got some better shots, myself included. That's kind of it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,Not great. Could have been better.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,Found him a little too much.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"But like you say, he presents his challenges. We'll watch film, get better, see if we can do a better job of containing him. He also made a lot of plays tonight. It felt like it. Yeah, he had 10 assists. He was kind of scoring and making plays, so we'll watch film and try to figure out how to do a better job containing him for sure."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, it's always good to have -- it's rare to have a feel like this where it feels like the playoffs, and we'll kind of take it and learn from it. Yeah, so it's a good opportunity for every team that's in the Cup to -- especially us being as young as we are to simulate being in a different city for however long and kind of having a playoff feel to it. It's definitely good practice, and now we have a lot more to learn from and still have I think 70 percent of the season left, so we have a lot of areas that we can improve, and this is a good kind of insight before we actually now get into the thick of it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"He did a good job tonight. I don't think he was the reason for my type of night. The way I felt tonight, I still got to my shot, my spot, I just didn't make anything. Things like that happen. Nights like that happen. But yeah, he played hard, was aggressive. Nothing I haven't seen before. But yeah, I feel like it was me missing more so."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, it's funny, we don't play them a whole lot being in the West, but yeah, from the outside looking in, it seems like he works hard. Like you said, he's been playing at a high level for a very long time. You don't get that without hard work. Yeah, it seems like he puts his head down and he works hard."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Disappointed. I mean, obviously it's a lot of money we're playing for. You saw them celebrating they're happy. I think when there's money on the line, everybody is going to play hard. But yeah, disappointed. I think you also have to know in a sense this doesn't really count for our record or stats don't really matter. But there is a competitive advantage, if I'm going to go play a game, I'm going to play hard. I'm not changing how I play just because of the circumstances. But yeah, I want to win, at the end of the day, and I think I speak for the whole team, and obviously they wanted to win. They had a fun time celebrating and they were playing hard. There hasn't been a team that we played during the whole Cup thing that didn't play hard, so I think it's a good thing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Well, first of all, congrats to Milwaukee. Both teams were trying to win that game, and they did that. They outplayed us and they deserved to win, so congratulations to them. In terms of our stuff, I thought we did some good things. We outscored them in the paint, so obviously we did the job defensively on that end, but obviously a tough night offensively all the way around for us. We didn't score nearly enough points, especially in the second half, to give ourselves a chance to win, but we can learn from it. We'll move forward here."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"It's usually a combination of things. It could be a shot-making thing. I thought we got some decent looks. I could have done a better job shaking us free in some situations. But we have 70 percent of the season left, so it's important that we zoom out of this one. We played three relatively high stakes games this week with Dallas, Houston and tonight, which is a valuable experience for us as we have a lot of the season left. We've got to take some of the lessons from this, good and bad, apply it forward, but obviously we weren't good enough on that end tonight."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"He's obviously a great player. I thought we weren't as tight with him with our defensive game plan as we were in Dallas or at the home game against Dallas or the Houston game or as we have been on many of the top guys we've played against this year. We've been really good about getting those guys to play to their weaknesses. We had some possessions where we did that with him, but we also had some breakdowns that I thought were uncharacteristic. He's a little different because where he catches it on the floor, the elbow isos and the post-ups, you don't see that every night. We can learn from it and be better the next time we play them, and we'll play them two more times."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Well, they're big, and they collapse the paint quite a bit, and you can get shots against them, and if you make them it can loosen them up a little bit, and I thought not being able to get some of those to fall kind of had them doubling down on the paint, and it made it harder and harder for us to get in there. Like I said, I could have done a better job. I never look at it as, like, we just missed shots. I could have done a better job shaking us free at different times in that game. But we can learn from it. It's a high-level opponent that it was a high-level game, and that's a good experience for our team and for everybody."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"It's closer to, like, elevated regular season than it is to the Playoffs in my opinion. The time of year has to do with that, the nature of a series versus a one-and-done situation has to do with that. But playing elevated opponents, good opponents with some elevated stakes, elevated distractions is a good experience in December for our team, and as I've said all along, win or lose, we're trying to grow with a lot of the season left, and being in these situations has helped us do that, so now we've got to take these lessons and head into the rest of the first half of the season."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,I made my point. I'm not going to get too far into it. I made my point. I like those guys. They did a good job. We didn't lose because of the refs.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Well, these are like the Lakers. They're like Dallas. There's a size element to them. They're a team that you really have to try to move around. It's hard to do that. They're really good at not doing that. Then there's blunt force on offense, similar to those teams. They pump fastballs against you and you've got to be able to hit 98. It's not just one game. But these are informative games. You win the Dallas game, we win the Houston game, those games give you confidence because they're elevated opponents. You execute, you go earn the games. Then when you lose a game like tonight, it gives you wisdom. It gives you information on yourselves, and as long as we're growing through all those experiences, then we'll gain momentum as the season goes on. We're still a young team and a team that's growing through everything. These were good experiences this week, and now we've got to get back into the rhythm of the season and continue to get going here."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"The shooting against their size. They've got Giannis and Lopez in the first unit, so I thought getting some shooting out there early was good. We got off to a great start offensively, 20 points before you could blink. The other thing I didn't know Middleton wasn't playing until later in the day. I thought Cason and Caruso for Middleton and Lillard, Middleton and Giannis was appropriate. We could have shifted some things around rotationally to accommodate that. I thought it kind of checked both boxes, and everybody is live, as usual. We've kind of settled in lately to Cason, but we'll continue to look at it tonight and kind of use the starting lineup and the rotation to test our team, look at different things, give different guys opportunities, as we've always done."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"I'd have to look at it again. Like I said, I could have done a better job. When your team scores 14 points in a quarter, the first place to look is the mirror. I've got to look at ways I can get us shaken free there. Obviously, there's always a shot-making element to everything, but we've got a good enough team that we should be able to generate some offense there, so I'll take that one."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"I love Chet. I wish he was available. I wish he wasn't hurt. But I'm very present in the games. At the end of the day, in these types of situations, you're playing your strengths against their strengths, and their strengths were stronger than ours tonight. But when we lose a game, we've proven that we can beat anybody with our strengths, so we're going to tap back into that. We're not going to daydream about what our vulnerabilities are or what the other team's strengths are. We're just trying to double down on the things we do well, which has been good enough in a lot of situations, so we've just got to learn from it, figure out how to attack it. Like I said, we play these guys two more times, so we'll be able to test ourselves again."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Jackson's pressure. They're picking up full and he's denying them full, and rather than having him go get the ball in the backcourt and exert a lot of effort to get the ball and get the ball over half court, we move him off the ball. It's an attack we've seen with Dillon Brooks. It's an attack we've seen with Herb Jones. There's multiple ways to play him. That's one way teams try to play him, and we've got solutions built in. We've got other guys that can create, other guys that can handle, and we try to do that. Obviously, we weren't able to shake him as much as we'd like to, but that was the reason for it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's the best feeling ever. Just winning. Winning feels good. Playing big games, feels good when you're able to come to the game and execute your game plan, and then the outcome is exactly what you want it to be. But it's not only about the game. It's about everything leading up to the game. The way you prep your body. The anxiety you feel that you want to get everything over with, let's go straight to the game. All those feelings leading up to the game. It's what makes the win even better. So proud of the group. Everybody was extremely locked in. We came in, we were focused and played great basketball, and we were able to win this game. We had this goal as a team, and we accomplished it. We accomplished it. I'm very proud of everybody. I'm so happy for Dame that we got our first trophy together. This is just the beginning. We have to keep on improving and getting better, and we will be better."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yeah, I'm happy. My kids weren't able to be here. My mom is at almost every game. My wife, almost every game. They weren't able to be here. Only Thanasis was here and my sister-in-law. So yeah, from where we started to where we are, I'm extremely happy. I'm proud of the journey. I don't take no moment for granted. I just have to embrace my brother and celebrate him. He's been supporting me since day one, not just in my basketball career, but as a brother. He's always been there for me. In all the high-pressure moments, all the tough moments, difficult moments, he's always there for me no matter the outcome. So I have to embrace my brother. I love him to death."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's fun. It's fun playing in Vegas. It's my second year of playing in Vegas. I've played a couple of Summer League games, maybe ten years ago here in Vegas. The atmosphere is incredible. I think the atmosphere in the game tonight was also very, very fun. I can't wait -- I think in probably one or two, three years, there's going to be a team in Vegas, so we're probably going to come here more often. For sure, we're going to come here for the NBA Cup moving forward. Coming here, competing in Vegas, for me it's fun because I don't leave my room. For others, it might be a little bit of a distraction. But I have fun. The weather is good. People are great. I'm able to get some In-N-Out Burger whenever I come here. So I love it. I love it. I have some great memories here."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"At the end of the day, when you approach a game like this, you're not thinking about MVPs. You're thinking about trying to win the game, and sometimes when you try to win the game and try to do whatever it takes, you put yourself in position to be successful and you're able to get a trophy like that. But yeah, I don't know. I don't know if they always -- the best player on the team gets the MVP trophy. In the history of the game, I don't think it's always been the case. But I think it's the guy that is able to lead in the series, or in that game, their team to victory. So I don't know. I don't know why I got the MVP. I'm happy that I got it. I don't take it for granted. I'm most happy we got to win the game. Some of my teammates got life-changing money. We had this joke within the team about our two-way guy, Liam Robbins, that I promised him from the first Cup game, I promised him, I said we're going to go all the way and we're going to get you a house in Iowa. So after every game, I'm like, hey, one step closer to your house in Iowa. After the game, I went to the locker room and I saw smiles on their face. For me, as I was saying before the game and halftime, the money does not matter to me. It never mattered. If money mattered to me, I wouldn't be who I am. I wouldn't keep on pushing myself to the limit to improve every single year. But I understand that this is life-changing money to people. I'm happy that we're able to give that to a lot of players within our team, and not just players -- coaching staff, physios and people that helped us to win this trophy. But this is a great moment for the team. This is a great moment for us individuals that we're able to win the second NBA Cup trophy. This is a moment in time that, last year we came here and we had a bad taste in our mouth and this year we came here and we're more improved, more composed. We played more team basketball and we're more humble. So I'm just happy that the outcome of this trip, it's a good outcome. But we have to stay humble. We have a lot of basketball front of us, and hopefully we can win the next trophy."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I feel like it means we have what it takes to compete with the best teams. Like OKC is one of the best teams in the West. But we have to stay humble. We have to stay humble. The last 15 games we've been competing. We've been playing team basketball. We've been setting the table for our teammates to be successful. Down the stretch, we played great basketball. We get open shots. Our defense has been better. The first ten games of the season we were the worst defensive team in the NBA, and now I think we are top 10 in the NBA. We hold a team that scored 100-plus points in all the games they have played to 80. We are getting better. I think with more time under our belt, we're going to keep on improving as a team. We have to improve as a team. We have a chance to go deep into the playoffs, but we have to stay healthy. Today we didn't have one of our best players, best decision-maker, best shot-maker, great incredible IHe wasn't available for the game. So there's a level to us that we haven't still tapped. We have just got to stay humble, keep on improving. We have a lot of basketball front of us. I think we play Cleveland on Friday. Very, very good team. They are going to be waiting for us. Right now, the emotion is at an all-time high. We have to bring it down, be humble. Once we leave here tomorrow, go back to the gym, lock in and hopefully we can go and get a win against the Cavs."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I'll be honest with you, in the beginning, I've never initiated my offense from the elbow or from the high post. Usually it's transition or screen and roll. So it was kind of a weird transition. I had the conversation with Doc. He told me that you can be very, very effective when you're at the elbow. You're under the wall. It's very hard for people to show a crowd, and when people show a crowd, it's easier for you to make that pass and you're one step closer to the basket. This whole summer I was working on that. And it's not only about scoring. There's levels to it. Sometimes you can facilitate. You can make the hockey assist to GT for the open three. You can create shots for yourself. You can get to the free throw line. I think it allowed me to be a little bit more effective down there and allows me to help my teammates be great. It's something new for me. I've played in the elbow for 25 games. I think I will stay there for the rest of my career because I'm getting better. I'm getting better at it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 17, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I don't drink. Last time I drink a little bit of champagne, when we won the NBA championship, I had like a full-body cramp laughter, so I try to stay away from it. I don't know who is superstitious. I don't know. I think the champagne should be in the locker room. Guys should celebrate this. You never know if you're going to be on this stage again. But for sure we're going to have a form of celebration. I don't know what it's going to be. Probably might have -- guys will go to dinner. Some guys might spend some time with their family. Some guys might -- I don't know, go out with their friends or whatever the case might be. But there have to be. There have to be. This has been a great trip. This has been a trip that for six days, everybody has been locked in. Locked in, on time in the film session, so focused on the walk-throughs. At practice, we are able to be so sharp. Yeah, we have a few hours until tomorrow to be loose a little bit with our family, which I definitely recommend and I would advise to all of my teammates. Not just my teammates -- the coaching staff and the physios, everybody that's part of the organization. They work extremely hard for us to be healthy and go and perform. All of them need a glass of wine and a good steak or chicken or fish, whatever they choose. Because we can take a break, a breather now. On Friday, we have one of the best teams in the NBA to play against. So we'll have to be ready."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, not everybody gets the same paycheck in the NBA. We have guys that are on two-way contracts and some guys that are fighting to stay in the league. So obviously that money is a bigger deal for some people than others, so we definitely play for that. Also, we're playing a really good team. So there's a lot of competitive fire, if not more that means more than obviously making the money. I like to win. So obviously it's like a big deal. And we've been saying that the whole time. Like if we are going into the Cup we might as well win the whole thing, and you play good teams while you're doing it. So there's an aspect to that. As a team, this is like the closest thing that you can get to a playoff environment for the most part throughout the whole season aside from a couple games are going to feel like that. It's a good, like, learning moment for us to be able to have a lot of media -- we are having like media before practice. We get to like simulate a lot of what's going on during the playoffs, during those stretches, to where we can kind of flex that muscle now and be better on later in the season. So there's a lot more involved than obviously the money. J-Will has been big on the money thing for us."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Whenever you're guarding really good players, it's not about just one person guarding somebody. It's about a team effort. And that's with anybody. Obviously, he's an extremely good player and kind of like a one-of-one. So we'll have a good game plan in place. Coaches always do a good job of putting us in the right place. But it's going to come down to how well as a team do we execute keeping guys like that at bay. Obviously, they have Damian Lillard, too. So just trying to find different ways a team that we can kind of slow them down will be big for us."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,I think the good teams keep the same mindset no matter what the game is. I think the stakes as far as like prizes and stuff will be higher but we're still going to be going against another good Orlando team and we're going to play against a good Miami team. Having that maturity to know that there's not going to be a competitive gear switch I think will be big for us.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think I said this yesterday. It's not Oklahoma playoff environment. But I think just as far as like media and like all the outside noise surroundings games, I think is a big deal. I think a lot of the best teams can kind of separate what's going on in the media to actually like play basketball. I think that's what I'm saying when I mean it because it's very hard, if not impossible, to actually replicate, you know, wearing the same jersey throughout the whole entire arena like Oklahoma does."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think it's good. I think, obviously the NBA is trying to have a team here. So I think the crowd's been pretty cool. But yeah, Vegas, I think can have an NBA team. I think it's cool that it's like a little test run into how successful it would be."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,I'm not. I'm not at all. I've been coming here since I was like six for AAU tournaments and stuff. So I've been here forever. I'm not the biggest fan. Too much stuff going on.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Before we start, Im sure everyone knows about the shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, five have passed away already, not a lot to say. Just a shame this keeps happening. Kids can't go to school safe, and it just seems like we don't do anything about it. Not going to get up here on the podium and give a long speech except for it's just bad, you know, and that we are thinking about them."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Good question. You know, it's interesting. I like that the space -- I guess if I could tweak one thing, it would be after this to try to give the teams that are playing in the finals a cushion. You know, I remember last year, I think I told Darvin this, during the game, I actually said, Oh no, how are the Lakers going to play right after this? Because emotionally you get high and you get thrown right back into it. I think we have a day off, and then we have a back-to-back. So we are going to try to cushion it the best way we can. But that would be the only tweak, I guess I would make. But I love it. I love the format. I like that people want to win this thing, and it's good."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Yeah, Damian didn't go, precautionary, and Khris is sick. So other than that, everybody was good."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"No. We just want to win all of them, if you want me to be honest but I don't think we need one. We believe who we are and we believe we're going to be here and we're here, and we don't have a signature win yet, I guess. I don't know what that is. You know, the way we started, that was impossible to have a signature win. We werent playing very well. You know, so no, would be the answer. Having said that, we want to win just like Oklahoma wants to win tomorrow. So let's get one."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"That's a great question that I don't know the answer. I think there's times where you watch the game and it looks beautiful, and then there's times where you watch the game and it looks awful. You know, I think it goes game-to-game. You know, I can watch Golden State play all night. They take a lot of threes. They move the ball. But I can watch Boston play, too, and it's not because they take a lot of threes. They play right. They move the ball. The ball moves to the right guy. They defend. They play together. And there's other teams that only just jack shots up, don't play defense, and I don't want to watch them. So I think it's hitter's choice, I guess. I thought last year, the game got more physical in the second half of the year, and I think fans actually enjoyed that. I think what we want is motion, movement, a physicality to the game, as well, and we like watching team play. I don't think that will ever go away. And so the teams that do that, you enjoy watching, and the teams that don't, you don't."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"It's impossible, and the reason it is, is it's unfair that we would have to play a West Coast team three times. It's unfair that whoever's in it, I guess is the best way to answer your question, you have to play them an extra time. That one game could be the difference in you getting the first seed and the second seed. I don't think as far as the game comes, it doesn't affect how we're going to play. You know, there's going to be a winner and there's going to be a loser. Both teams who are in the Championship want to win. So I don't think it hurts the competition part. I don't like that the numbers aren't counted. I don't know how you can do that. I'm not smart enough to figure that out. I think AD had a monster game last year. You know, big points, big assists, and rebounds and that should be counted in something. You know that, just shouldn't go away. So that part, as far as record, I don't think you can."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"I'm all for that, yeah. Yeah, let's do that laughing. You know, that wouldn't be bad. I could say something on that but I'm going to stay away because I've been fined once."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"As long as it's a warm place, I'm good. Just no cold places, please. And it's actually cool here. I don't know. I don't even subscribe to the whole -- that Vegas has to be the place, anyway. It's just a convention city. It's a neutral site, which is very difficult to find. If they want to move it around to other neutral, warm city sites, I think everybody would be fine with that. It feels like this is the perfect place, in my opinion, but I don't think it really matters, and we're all going to have -- the issue with like attendance in this is, you know, five days ago, no one from Milwaukee knew we were going to be here. No one from Oklahoma knew they were going to be here. It's tough. You're not going to have like a two-week period where your teams know when people can plan and come. You know, and so obviously last year, the Lakers were in it. That's a three-hour drive, four but three if you're driving fast and you can come and watch the game. That would be the only issue that would be nice to figure out but I don't know how you figure that out."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"No. No. It just means that we decided -- I guess for us, we were struggling early, and the Cup started and we said, ""Let's win it."" That told me that our team believed what I believed that we're going to be good. We're going to be a really good team at some point. It just took longer than we thought, and now we're here. So I guess it means that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"It's better because it's not regular season where you play every other day or two days. You can actually -- you know, you can actually watch enough film and make some adjustments. If we wanted to, we could have had two days of practice for this. I would say the biggest difference is like neither team practiced yesterday. Both teams got shots up. Neither team did much today. If this was a playoff game, today would have been a much livelier practice, I would say that. I think the way, at least we look at it is, because we have a bunch of games following this, that you're looking at your legs past this game, as well. And so I think that would be the only thing as far as preparation. But you know, it would be great if you had two and three days every game to prepare for teams. It would be a different game."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Well, it depends on your team and it depends on the guy. A lot of times, send personal messages to the guys. The bigger the game, the more the team has to be a team. And what usually happens when things go awry, is either the role players just decide, I'm just going to lean on your stars, and that never goes well. Or your stars decide, I'm going to win the game for us, and that never goes well."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"The simple answer, offensively our best shooters, the ball wasn't going in. Brook, I think was in the 20s. Bobby was in the 20s. TP was in the 20s. AJ Green was in the 20s. These are great shooters, and that's something we didn't even address. Like we knew, like you don't forget how to shoot. We just knew that would catch up. I think the biggest change is our defense, over the last 12 or whatever games, we're in the Top-10. During that stretch, we are 27, 26. You know, you're not going to win a lot of games there. The biggest change is we've caught up to what we've been trying to teach defensively. Our shooters are making shots, and we have a guy named Giannis, and the more misses you get with this team, the more lethal he is because that gets him out in fast breaks. That gets him in the middle of the floor. When you're taking the ball out every time, that takes away some of what Giannis can do. But we can get teams and have multiple misses every game, but Giannis gets out and we get to spread the floor, we are pretty lethal when that happens."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I don't think so. I mean, we all -- they made it to the Cup final and we made it to the Cup final. I don't think it's any deeper than that. They have been a good team for some years now. They are not new to it. These guys have been top of the West I think the last three years. It's just two good teams from both sides playing in a championship with a Cup. Obviously they are a younger team than we are. But they win games. They are a good team. We win games. We're a good team. It just comes down to one game, and that's it. I don't think nobody, at least with us, is looking at it like, Oh, we old and all that and they young. I don't think nobody on our side is looking at it like that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I like it. I think it provides excitement for us as players and excitement for the fans. It's something on the line before you get to the playoffs. I think it just brings out the best in us. You get in these Cup games where the floor is different. The uniform is different. You know that we're playing for something. There's a prize at the end, obviously, a trip to Vegas and ultimately just an opportunity to win something as a team."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Obviously I play a part in it. For our team to be successful, I've got to be a good version of myself. Coming into the second year, having a better understanding of who I'm playing with, coming back knowing who I'm playing for, having that time, as well, with Doc last year and just being able to step away from last season and get my life in order and then also have the time to properly prepare. Getting healthy, getting my training in and having my mind right coming back into the season was all it really was for me."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,None taken.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,I don't know. We're going to have to see. I understand what's being attempted. You want to create some type of competitiveness in that game on Sunday. You want to try to mix it up to try to find a way to make it more entertaining. We'll see.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Like the second quarter of the game against Atlanta, I just kind of irritated it a little bit. So it was just some discomfort. When I have something with my calf, sometimes I start panicking. But I knew it wasn't nothing serious. Just a little irritation. So I've just been doing treatment and doing all the stuff to try to get ahead of it and just get ready for tomorrow."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"No, I'm playing. I'm playing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think it's been pretty simple. Just being a vet, I know any time you miss a significant amount of time, you really need a period to get your body used to being on the floor, playing at this pace, the physicality, your conditioning, your timing. There's going to be some rust there, I think. With Khris being such a smart player, he's going to find a way to be effective. The trust and chemistry that he has with Giannis, he's going to be able to find his spots and ways to be effective on our team. Being able to shoot the ball helps, as well, his size. All of those things help him transition back a little bit easier. I think for us, it's just not thinking about it too much. You know, trying to overly incorporate him and involve him and all that stuff. He's smart enough to find his way into it, and obviously we're going to have a lot of opportunity for him. He's going to handle the ball in playmaking positions. Like you said, he's going to be our inbounder. He's going to be involved to where the opportunity will be there, but we're not going to like try to force it or nothing like that. I think we've got a good thing going. We've figured out a lot of things. I don't think he's someone we need to overly help or be concerned with working him in. I think it will happen organically. I think that's what's happening right now. He's slowly building himself right back into it. But you see him with the ball in his hands and getting opportunities, and I think we just let it happen that way."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It's been fun. Obviously the added stakes in the game gives it a little bit of a different feel. It's good prep for postseason. It's obviously heightened stakes than a regular season, 82-game season and it's good to get reps in games that mean a little bit more and have stakes to it. It's been fun and beneficial to the group for sure."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Talented group, obviously. They speak for themselves. Obviously, their head of their snake presents its challenges. We at the end of the night have to be who we are and have to take the fight to them. I think if we do that, we'll be all right."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, it will be fun. It gives the game a little bit of like a March Madness feel with the neutral site, like home-court advantage, but at the end of the night, the better team will win. It's about focusing on being that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"To be completely honest with you, I don't differentiate games on who I play against. If we play the worst team in the league, the best team in the league, I'm trying to take their head off. I am trying to be the best version of myself every night I step on the floor. And I think that's why I've been able to grow the way I have as a person and a player is because every night is an opportunity for me to get better, and whoever stands across that line doesn't change that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, if I get a chance to go, obviously it's a blessing. Support whatever they do because it's an honor to be there. But obviously with the elephant in the room being us competing, them trying to shake things up is expected and makes sense. But at the end of the day, it's going to come down to whether the players wanting to go at it, and I would love to see that. Love to be a part of that for sure, and hopefully it happens."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, look, I was always taught growing up, like basketball is going to come down to taking what the defense gives you and being a weapon. Like as many times down the court in as many ways as you can, and that's just what I focused on in my career, summer in, summer out, season in, season out. And that's just -- it's just been like another hurdle, another steppingstone. Like I just try to be a better version of myself, and make sure that the defense has to pay for whatever they try to throw at me. And I've gotten better at it every year, and it's been work paid off."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I try, yeah, like you said, to be like a pioneer. I try to create my own wave on and off the court. Try to just do things my way. Growing up I was always taught to be a leader, never a follower, and so that's kind of instilled me. And then I did draw the logo. Created it myself, and I'm glad the way it came to life for sure."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Biggest life lesson. I think basketball is a lot like life, and I think I would say like what you give to the game, the game will give back to you. And you can't cheat it, just like life. If you want to be a doctor if you want to be a middle school teacher if you want to be a dentist, whatever you want to be, what you put into it, you'll get out of it. And there's no faking. There's no fooling the universe, it knows. And for the kids out there, I guess that just leads into working hard. That's what I've been able to -- how I've been able to build all of this, is just working hard and not caring what anybody has to say about me and doing things my way because when it's all said and done, you don't want to have any regrets, no doubts. You want to know that you gave it your all and that you did it how you wanted to do it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"He's been amazing. Obviously, we lacked a little bit of physicality in the past as a group, and he's been able to plug that hole immediately. And then the little things he does, like his IQ offensively, his passing, his play-making, his touch around the rim, his screening, he's opened the game up for guys like myself and the rest of the team. And then the most underrated part, I would say is his unselfishness as a player. Like every night he doesn't care if he has 20 points, zero points, if he has 15 rebounds or zero rebounds. As long as we win and he affects it, he's happy. Like there have been so many times, like I've tried to get him in a position to score, like help him get in a spot and he's just like, ""I don't care. As long as you get open, I'll figure out the rest."" For him to reciprocate that is a cool feeling, and the teammate he is is what's been special so far."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"A little more but it's an early game tomorrow. We're not having a formal shoot around. So really, not a ton. And we're still in the mode of improving and kind of building our muscle systematically, and this is not a departure from that. And we think that that also gives us the best chance to win the game. So one way or the other really not changing our preparation very much because we think our preparation is sufficient as it is."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Among people qualified to weigh in on that, I'm very far down the list, so I'm just going to abstain."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Yeah, this is a great test for us. The game, we played them late in the year last year on the road and they really took it to us, and it was a great game for us. Because we had been having a great season to that point, and we ran up against a team that was really ready to take it to us, and they did. Physically mauled us. Played with more edge that night. It was good -- it was like water in the face for us. I thought it really informed us at the level of physicality, focus, everything you need to win against a good team, they exposed, on that particular night. And again, we are focused. We have 70 percent of the season left. So we are focused on continuing to grow. But testing yourself against a team that's playing as well as they are, that's as capable as they are, will help us one way or the other. If we clear the hurdle, we'll have earned it, and if we don't, we'll learn about ourselves. That's why playing in games like this is very valuable."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"It hasn't happened, so I don't know. Again I'm more focused on the growth of the team with 70 percent of the season left, and with the age of our team, we are not a finished product and we have a lot we can improve on, and a lot we have to sustain if we want to be a good team. And this is a great challenge. You know, it's an elevated situation with a lot of distractions and a lot of noise around it against a very good team. So it's a great test and a great challenge to kind of figure out where we are and how we play in this type of situation, and we're going to learn from it one way or the other. But I don't know otherwise."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"The league has never been more skilled, dynamic. The offenses have been never been more efficient. The shooting's never been more capable across the league. I think the numbers would support that. And that obviously gets a lot of attention but basketball is a game that 50 percent of the game is played on offense and the other half is played on defense, and the attention doesn't always reflect that. But there's two sides to that coin. So if the league is as skilled as it is, if the shooting is as good as it is, if the players are as good as they are, the ability to guard that becomes paramount. That's the flipside of the coin. And we've got guys that not only are capable but they are committed to it and they are competitive and they understand the value of it to team success, and it's been a huge strength of our team to this point."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Well, we want to win. This is an opportunity to win and it's an opportunity to compete and we're going to be very present in that. There's no other way to be. And so we are not getting ahead of ourselves with that. But it will be a challenge coming out of it for both teams. You know, we're coming off of -- we're basically on a six-day West Coast road trip right now, and our next game coming out of this is three time zones away, four-hour flight to Orlando and then a back-to-back against Miami. Which if you look that as a road trip, is an unprecedented road trip. I mean, the NBA would never schedule that. They would never put a team a six-day West Coast road trip, and then fly them east for a back-to-back. And so you know, this is a great challenge for us. We're excited about it. But it will present challenges on the other side but we'll handle those when we're there."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"To a degree. I mean, there's kind of two parts to every game plan. There's the individual player, and those guys have habits and they have strengths, and you can learn them. And we obviously have got some familiarity with him from his time there. But then there's those skills inside the ecosystem that they are in now, and they are a different animal with him combined with the other guys on their team. You know, especially with Giannis, and those two guys in a pick-and-roll presents like a completely different challenge. So a little bit, but also they are different when they change teams and change systems, change teammates, that sort of thing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"He's always the coolest guy in the room. It doesn't matter what room he's in. He's the coolest guy in the room. So I've seen him respond. What's impressive to me about him, aside from what everybody can see on the surface, is the defense, first of all. He continues to play on that end of the floor with great commitment despite being obviously a great offensive player. And then the ascension of his teammates, which isn't a given with a great player like that. Sometimes their greatness and their gravity can bite into the hole. But his teammates have been able to ascend, despite his ascension. And so guys like Jalen, guys like Chet, those guys, it has not stopped them from becoming great players in their own right. And guys like Isaiah Joe, Wiggins, role players have maximized themselves. And I think those two things on this stage, I think go a little bit overlooked, just overshadowed by his greatness on offense. But to answer your question, he's the coolest guy in the room."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"No, no. I haven't really -- I don't really think about that. I go out there, I try to compete. Play at a high level and try to improve as much as I can. I think when you approach the game that way, things like being in the Finals of the NBA Cup, winning the Championship, things like that just fall in place. I think any player that approaches the game, approach any big game thinking any -- oh, all season, I want to win the MVP, I want to do that, I want to do this, and that is main goal, it won't happen. It won't happen. You know, because you approach the game the wrong way, and you're thinking about yourself. Yeah, I wanted always to be one of the best players to ever play, like every kid that plays basketball. When you're in your backyard and you're dribbling the ball or in your neighborhood playing in your basketball court there, you're thinking about being one of the best and making that shot and making a cross-over to a jumpshot and dunking on somebody. You always think about that. But it takes so much more. You know you've got to sacrifice so many things. You've got to be consistent. You have to have a fearless mentality about yourself. You've got to have confidence. So it takes a lot more for you to get to that point. Even when I got to the league, obviously I saw a lot of players, I think my first interaction being around the All-Star Game and being around all these NBA greats, Carmelo was there, Steph, Klay, Cousins, LeBron, Jimmy, like all these players, you see the way they carry themselves. You're like, okay, you've got to like -- you've got to give more. You've got to give more to the game and that's what I always try to do. I try to give everything I have for the game, and if that sometimes leads to success and individual accolades, that's good. And if not, it is what it is."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I think we are competing. I think we are competing more. You know, I feel like everybody understands in order for us to be in a game or to win a game, we've got to compete more. Early this season, I felt like we had this mindset, just because we have great talent within the team, that things don't just happen. Like guys just going to dribble the ball up and give us the ball I'm going to go the other way and try to score. And that's not what happened in the first 10 games. We were 2-8, and I think we came together, watched a lot of film. Had a lot of conversations, and we said, we've got to compete with every game we play. Win or lose we've got to compete. It's got to be a close game. We've played a lot of close games this year, and it's going to be the little things that we have to do that's going to like change the game. And I think at times, we've done those little things, and other times we haven't. But we have a lot of work to do. We're not at our best yet. Got to keep on improving. It's good that we've played well the last couple of games but we have a lot of work to keep on doing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I don't know. I don't know. Because like I'm not the one shooting the threes, you know. So I don't know, obviously I think the game is evolving. If it's evolving and it's becoming better, I have no idea. I've got to think about that question. But yeah, when I came to the league in 2013, teams werent shooting this many threes, and I know it wasn't that long ago, but I remember like you had players like Al Jefferson, like we had a great player on our team, Greg Monroe, we had to put the ball in the post and then play off the post. Guys were moving, screening, cutting. You were playing deeper into the 24-shot clock. Now it's different. It's totally different, and I don't know if that -- I don't know if that necessarily helps my game. But at the end of the day, the game is evolving. It looks good. We have more eyeballs watching basketball right now. So I don't know. I don't know. I can answer that question maybe when I see you again."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's life-changing money, okay. Obviously 500,000, you can put a down payment on a house. You can put the down payment on two houses. Some players, like might not make that money ever in their career. So it's definitely, you play for them, too. It's an ongoing joke we have in our locker room, like we say we play for the young guys because this money will mean a lot to them. But it really means a lot to everybody because it's a lot of money. But for me, I don't think. I try not to think about the money, which no, it's accurate -- it's not accurate what I'm saying. I think about the money but I think about the money when we talk about the young guys. Personally, I try not to think about the money. For the game, I love playing basketball. I don't love playing basketball any more for the money and because I don't like to lie. When I came to the league, obviously you want to take care of your family. You want to send your brothers to better school than you went to. You want to create a better life for your parents, boy your mom a house, you know, all the stories about all the athletes. But at one point if that's what motivates you, you won't go far. There's got to be something within you that wakes you up every single day to go and put your body through this stress, you know that we put our bodies through, it's just creating more art. It's creating more moments that I can remember. Creating more legacy for myself or something that my kids can look back to and say, Damn, my dad was a bad MF'er when he used to play. But I totally understand this is life-changing opportunity for all the young players within our team, and some people need this. And not just for the young people. Not just the young players, the coaches, too. Coaches, physios. Some people, it would change their life. So yeah, you know, we've got to -- not just for that but I want to win. That's why I play. But that's extra motivation, also that I know that if we win the game, a lot of people are going to benefit from it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 16, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"First of all, the league is growing, not just because of the NBA Cup. It's growing because there's a lot of talent coming from overseas. Like you can see the last couple of years, the No. 1 picks, both were from France, if I'm not mistaken. And you see, like some of the best players in the league today, the last couple of years, they are not American. Even Shai, I think Shai is Canadian, right, Jokic, Luka, Wemby. So the game is becoming like even more like -- I think it's at its best that it's ever been with more international. I love this system, this play, NBA Cup system. It was my first time going to watch the Euroleague Final Four this year in Berlin, and you could see, like it was two games, Semifinal and Final, and how much it mean to the teams, to the atmosphere. It was incredible, the attention to it, the pressure that we had. So I love that the NBA kind of adapted this system, like within the -- within the regular season you have games that means more, but when you come here, you have two games that brings a lot of attention to basketball, to the NBA, to the teams and teams have opportunity to kind of make something happen. You know, because not necessarily always the best NBA team going to win the Cup. It's who going to play the best basketball in those knockout games, kind of, which I love. And the NBA has figured out ways to bring more attention to the game, and the NBA Cup is an example of that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"I mean, you just -- in the moment, you continue to uplift them and give them praise, even when they miss. We know the shots that certain guys got tonight we've been making, and we're going to continue to make going forward. Some shots didn't go tonight. That's what you have to do as a leader, to continue to uplift them no matter what the circumstances and how they go that night."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"I kind of figured there would be a lot of Hawks fans out here with the Falcons playing Monday. It was good. You could definitely hear them in the crowd tonight. It was good to have them out here supporting us. Wish we could have won for them. So yeah, that's all I have to say. They were supportive obviously. I wish we could have won."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"Of course. Of course. But at the end of the day, we have got another one next week. We have got another game next week. It's not the Cup game. We're not going to win an extra little bit of money. But at the end of the day, this was a great experience for us, and we took full advantage of it. We're going to learn from it, and it's going to make us better."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"Just not to give up. I think what we have done in this Cup was really, really special, really good. I think we've really found the way we want to play and figured out the tempo we want to play at and things like that. Now that we've got guys healthy and back, we are able to find a little rhythm with guys playing and knowing when they are going to come out and play. It's been good. I feel like this Cup was really good for us. For a young team to go as far as we did, we can really use this as hopefully momentum going into the rest of the season."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"I don't know if they made it any tougher. I think guys just missed shots. Jalen had a wide-open three in the corner. I had an in-and-out sidestep. I had a good look. There were a couple shots that we had that just didn't go down. Dyson had a wide-open three at the top of the key. Those were all late-game shots and momentum shots. If we don't make that and they come down and hit a layup or Giannis goes to the free throw line, it's a back-breaker. That's just part of it. We're going to learn from it. It's not the end of the world. We're going to learn from it and be better from it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"Yeah, the defensive end is going to get us to where we really want to go, and especially where I want to go. I want to go far in the playoffs. So no matter like my offensive game has been -- I've gotten people involved, but shooting-wise have not been able to get it going. But to be honest with you, I haven't really been worried about it. I've just been so focused on the defensive end and focus on that part because I know it's going to carry us to where we really need to go. I think if we continue to have this mindset, the offense is going to be what finds itself. In past years, that's what's led us. So when that is secondary for our team and our identity, that's going to be really scary at the end of the day."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"We were getting the same looks. I think we slowed down a little bit. There's so much going on in these games, kind of had to settle in the first half, but our defense was great, so that carried over the whole game. Offense comes and goes, but when you can play defense and kind of shut certain things down, I think we did a good job of that, and offense came late."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, that was not supposed to go in, and it did. That was the story of the second half. Yeah, he's been great, finding us late, trusting us to make shots like that. So happy to knock it down. It was kind of a big shot, big moment, momentum was kind of shifting. Like I said, we were generating looks in the second half that we were getting in the first half and we were making them, so that makes it fun."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Our playoff atmosphere for people who are not familiar is very hard to replicate in Oklahoma, so I wouldn't say it's that, but it does have a certain energy to it that makes it very competitive. It's probably because of the money. But there is like a very competitive aspect to it. Obviously, everybody wants free money."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"It has nothing to do with actually being on the court. I think the way that he approaches basketball and his life outside of the court is something that nobody else really gets to see except us, and us being as close as we are, too, I get to learn how he carries himself on and off the floor, and I think that's helped my development. Then I think just on the floor, when you're the guy on the team, you're responsible for playing good or bad, and I think he does a good job of carrying that and trusting us. He just does a good job of staying within the team and not letting a lot of the outside noise affect him, and he's been the perfect role model for me and the rest of the guys to one day try and reach that level and obviously just be able to help him during the season."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"That's a lot, huh."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I don't know if that really applies to my thing. I think every year I just try and master one thing, so when I get to certain points, I know that this year I can master one thing and then I can go to next year and I can master multiple things, and I think that's what makes it unique to be very good at a lot of things, so every year I can kind of focus on one thing or two things at once and do that. But I try and take one thing at a time and not rush it. My dad is big on just one year at a time. You're not playing this for one year. I'm trying to be in the NBA for 15 plus and do that. Over the course of my work, I would like to master multiple things a year and see where I pan out."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think it's a very good test for us later on to kind of understand the Playoffs and just kind of simulate that. I think that's the biggest thing. Obviously aside from the money, I think just having the amount of media that we have here and how much more intense the games are, it's kind of a good simulation of focus when we're not on the court to be able to come in here and play and get the job done. Aside from that, we're trying to replicate a playoff kind of feel and go from there."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I'll do Shai first. Shai is not afraid to take shots that he works on. That's one of those things where it forces the other team to respect it because he's such a good scorer, and then he also understands that that's opening up driving lanes for us to be able to shoot. Obviously for Lu, we call him ""Big Game Lu"" obviously for a reason. He just does a good job of staying in the moment. He understands his role and he's always ready to make the play. He didn't shoot it particularly well in the first half I don't think, but just being able to stick with it and play defense and then still be ready in those big moments when we need him to hit shots is big, and his confidence is never shaken. Definitely one of the key guys, and he knows it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think from an X's and O's standpoint we'll leave it to the coaches, but basketball is about who can make the other team play on their terms, so we're going to go out there and play how we usually do, and I'm sure the coaches will have a good game plan for us to be able to go back out there and do our thing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",IME UDOKA,"Yes, it sometimes comes down to making shots. You know, especially in the first half, we guarded well enough, holding them to 41. If you make a few shots, you're probably up double figures. The other way we like to attack is get stops and get out. I think that's when we built our biggest lead, the seven-point lead. We got some stops and got out in transition. So we won those areas, offensive rebounds, transition. Obviously, individuals got to shoot the ball a little bit better and you're in a good spot. But you put a lot of pressure on your defense when you're not making shots like that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",IME UDOKA,"A little bit of both. The turnovers hurt us in the first half. Like I said, when we built the seven-point lead, we had back-to-back turnovers that got them out in transition where they hit a three, and the lead kind of dissipated pretty quickly. Taking care of the ball against a team that packs the paints and gets a lot of steals and turnovers, that would help. But sometimes, like I said, it just comes down to making shots. If they are going to dare you to make shots, wide-open looks, you've got to hit those. But we try to play with faster pace and crash the offensive glass, like we did all year, and that kept us afloat until our defense kind of broke down in the third quarter."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",IME UDOKA,"I think the turnovers helped them get out a little bit and get going. But they did make some more shots. I think they were 2-for-18 at halftime. We were 4-for-19. Both teams were missing, and they were the team to start making them more so. To hold them to 41 in the first half and give up 34 in that quarter, our defense started to give up a little bit there. We scored 27, so we actually were scoring better in that quarter. They got it going from three and that was a major difference. Fouls on three-pointers hurt us, too. Nine points on three fouls on three-point shooters. So that was the difference in that third quarter."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",IME UDOKA,"It's a heightened situation. It's a playoff atmosphere, and everybody is playing to move on obviously. So you've got to bring your ""A"" game. Obviously when you look at the stats, look down the stat sheet, I would say Amen and Tari really brought their ""A"" game off the bench. Other than that, we really struggled, from the starters. You have to play better in certain situations like this. Once SGA and Williams and Dort hit some big threes, once they got it going in the second half, that was really the difference. A few of their guys scored the ball better than ours."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",IME UDOKA,"Fred got a wide-open three in transition that would have cut it to two. Like you said, they were up 84-79. He had a wide-open three from the high quadrant that would cut it to 82-84. Missed that, and they get out on the break again. It was more of the same, honestly, that really hurt us in that quarter. Battled our way back. Had not been playing well. We talked about in that timeout they called, it's a five-point game and we haven't really played well at all, especially offensively. To see it go back the other way was due to some of our errors. But we also missed some wide-open shots, especially in transition."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",IME UDOKA,"We have a year under our belt that we saw what worked well for us and so we could kind of reiterate those same points, and guys haven't done it for the first time. I don't think there was a stress on us to be good right away last year. That wasn't really the expectation. It was to take a step, which we did, going from 22 to 41 wins, and being more competitive overall. But our goal was the playoffs. We fell a little short of that, but it wasn't any added pressure on them as far as that. I think we made the right steps, and then came to this year obviously doing more of the same. Another year under our belt and seeing success late in the season last year really helped propel us at the start of the season."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"Yeah, we had some good looks. I think us being able to execute during that stretch is something we need to get better at. I can't go through all seven shots. I know there were a few that were really good shots, and we had to work for them. That said, I think we know whatever that is -- it could be on the margins -- there are certain things that we need to do better. But I think for us to put ourselves in that situation, given we didn't really make shots during the course of the game, either. I'm proud of the team and the way we -- I think the storyline for me is just how we competed. Our consistency in that area is the most important thing because I think that's what we have to do to continue to try to build an identity. This was an opportunity to -- this whole tournament, to play in some situations and some games against some really good teams and try to do that. You find out about yourself. You find out when you're in a game like this. You're able to look back and say, we need to do this better. And we did this pretty well."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"There was a number of times that I thought they were physical with him. He can handle that and doesn't shy away from that. I think in some of his shots, that's a slightly different situation. We'll play through that. There's games where you don't make shots that other games you make. He's been terrific. The thing about 'Dre is that even if -- and this is true of our team but especially of him. Even if maybe the ball is not going in the way it has been, he's able to impact the game in different ways, and he did that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"I thought we competed throughout the entire possession. There were a couple situations that we struggled to guard. Obviously any time you play Giannis, it's going to be hard. But for us creating offense off our defense, I think when -- the key for us is not to have empty possessions. When we get in the lane and don't finish, it's hard to defend against that. Some of those, that's going to happen at times when Brook Lopez is down there. We have to continue to work to get in there, create help situations and play with our eyes out. I thought we could be more consistent and better in that area. Some of the shots we're going to get will be easier. We can space better. Invariably when we turn the ball over, there is usually something you can trace it to. Those are the times when it's hard to defend."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"Yeah, any time -- Dyson is, I think, 21, Zacch is 19, JJ is 22. Those guys are all starting for us. There's going to be ups and downs with young players. There's ups and downs with everybody, but particularly with young guys. So for us to be in this type of environment and be in these types of games, I think is really important. One of the other things that's happened is -- we mentioned De'Andre -- some of our more veteran guys that are still pretty young, I think have really assumed a leadership role. You see that. You guys don't see it in the locker room and off the court, but you can really -- it's visible on the court, how those guys are not only supporting each other but trying to give each other confidence. I think the youth helps the older, more veteran -- I don't call them veteran, but veteran guys, and I think the veteran guys in their experience in these types of situations can settle the younger guys. I've said it before, the term I've used is long runway. Our growth is not going to be just linear. We're going to have those moments, and every time we have -- like tonight, what can we take from it? I think that's really true for Zacch and Dyson and JJ, these moments, because they are getting an opportunity at a young age to be in them. There's a lot of opportunity."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"I'd have to go back and look. I don't think we got the shots we wanted all the time. I felt like we had some that were good shots, and even a couple that we may have passed up. Sometimes you pass one up and you don't get a better one. But that's part of it for us. I liked it the fact that we have really bought in to defending, and that really helps us."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"I think for our group, I've felt strongly that we can't get too high and we can't get too low, because I think both those situations, we potentially already have experienced that in the regular season. I think we were picked 10th in the East. So when you talk about playoffs, I'm trying not to think about any -- not that I don't want to make the playoffs, but whatever it is, I think the challenge for us is to really stay focused on improving and wherever that takes us, we'll see. But that approach for this group, to care, there's no -- you guys saw the game. There's no question we wanted to win, but at the same time, understand the things that we need to do so that winning takes place. If we keep that approach and try to continue to improve, I don't know where we end up in that regard. But if we are a better team in January than we are in December and a better team in February and a better team in March, that's the goal."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"Yeah, I think for the most part, I mean, they are a good defensive team obviously. We started off a little off rhythm, out of rhythm, a couple turnovers. They did, too. It was kind of ugly to start. But we just never found the rhythm and never found a flow. If you're not going to make shots against a team like that, it just gradually gets tougher to score. That lack of scoring puts pressure on your defense, and it just kind of compounds things. I thought our execution was okay. It wasn't bad by any stretch. But what determines that? Is it making shots or are you executing? Kind of depends on how you look at it. Make some shots, offense looks better. Obviously we didn't."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",ALPEREN SENGUN,"Yeah, of course. There's a lot of things we've got to learn. It was a tough game. We knew it was going to be a tough game. So we have now off days. We can just watch it, learn it and just focus on the season."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"Yeah, I think so. I think there's always room to grow and get better. You would like to learn by winning all the time and everything to be great, but that's not reality. I think it's a valuable experience being here with the stage and the way the NBA has kind of set up this game and this weekend. It has that playoff-style atmosphere, intensity. Obviously it's a neutral site here. For a young group, I think it's valuable experience. But obviously we're very disappointed in our performance today."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"Yeah, for sure. I have watch that stretch again. But I think we got to five. I think we fouled a three-point shooter, maybe once or twice in a short period of time and they made a shot. So, yeah, it's tough. Buckets were hard to come by tonight, and they go on a little 8-0 run to give themselves a cushion, it makes it tough. So again, I mean, Shai got to the line 15 times. That hurts. Lu, five threes. That hurts. Guys made plays and we didn't. Other than Dillon, nobody else really made shots tonight. I make a couple more shots, we probably feel a little bit better. So I'll take the blame for that one."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"Yeah, I think you definitely could feel it. The whole building felt it just watching the game. We definitely feel it. We're out there. We got some great looks. Stuff didn't fall. A couple things go this way, that way, a couple calls here and there, a couple shots. It's a game of inches out there. The margin is so thin. It ended up being 15, but it certainly was closer than that for most of the game and could have went either way. Like I said, we never really got on top and seized the moment and took over the rhythm. It's hard to do that when you shoot 36 percent from the field and 23 from three. It was a tough one out there."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",ALPEREN SENGUN,"I mean, there's not like -- you know, it was a bad day for a couple of our best players, and that was one of me. I just didn't start the game my best. But you know, just like we said, we've got to learn from here. Just got to get better and start getting ready again."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"I'll add to that. I think that we should be disappointed in our performance, but it's more of a missed opportunity than a disappointment. This is something outside of the norm. It has no impact on the season. It would have been great to win this thing, but our goals are for the end of the season. We can be disappointed in our performance, but at the end of the day, we missed an opportunity. We didn't lose our season tonight. So we've got to get back to work."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"What I will say publicly is we have to figure it out. We have to be better offensively. Other than that, I'm not really going to talk about what we want to do here. Coach can probably give you a better answer than that. It's my job as a point guard to figure out how to get this team to perform better. It starts with myself -- 3-for-15 and 1-for-11 is not good enough. Other than that, everything else will probably try to be ironed out behind the scenes and just find something that feels better and get more flow more consistently. We'll continue to iron it out."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Yeah, I just thought our help defense, I thought that that block -- I mean, how many times did you see that lob get blocked? I think we got two of them today. So we drilled it all day yesterday, and we have the capable players who can do it, between Brook and Bobby and Giannis. I mean, those are the type of guys that can go get that. I thought they did a great job of doing that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"He's tough, man. I thought we did a great job. We really wanted to try to take away a big assist night for him. He had 10 still, but our game plan was to try to make him play against one-on-one instead of going downhill. I thought Trae deserves a lot of credit because he fought over screens and it turned into iso one-on-one, and though Trae can have those games where he can hurt you, when he does that, he's not helping anybody else, so that's what we were trying to do as much as we can. I thought we did a pretty good job of it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Well, we really didn't clean it up, we just got the ball in bounds. I reminded our guys, you know, you can go in the backcourt laughing. We will be better. That was a brain fart. None of those were good, honestly. We have not had problems at all getting the ball inbounds. It might have been the first time in a while. Khris is our guy, but sometimes you forget that he hasn't played and so I thought you could see that a little bit."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"It's funny, a lot of people say it's the money, and it's not it's the competition. Now, the guys who aren't playing, it's the money. You know, I've never been hugged more by our rookies in my life than after that game. They were celebrating like it was a big game. But I just think it's a competition, man, and you want your team to be competitive. You want them to -- I'm not going to get on a soapbox, but I just think I'm not going to go generation. I'm trying not to. Accept the challenge, that's all I've been talking about. I think we run from challenges a lot, and we talked about it let's accept it. Let's put our name out there. We're going to try to win it, and if we don't win it, we don't win it. But there's nothing wrong with saying you want to win something, and if you win it, great, and if you don't, at least you went for it. That's what I'm proud of our guys. I think Giannis did it when we said it. He was the first guy, he just threw it out there, we want to win, and I think it's good for our team."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Oh, the loose ball where he dove on the floor, yeah."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Winning plays. We never show film after a game, and we showed the winning plays today. Like, you got to -- it takes what it takes. I wish you could script what it takes. You don't know it until the game starts, until the end. Certain guys, Dre makes a three, you know, a big three. Giannis and Brook get a double block, Giannis gets a loose ball. You can't script any of that stuff before the game, but you just got to keep teaching that it just takes what it takes every night. Tonight was a great example of that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Yeah, it's game to game. It's a good question. It's so funny, he looked to me with like five seconds like I need a do-over, you know, and I said, well, you get it Tuesday. That's the great thing about the NBA. You could see the rust. Like the layups, the transition where we threw it ahead before he knew it, that's at least a foul or a basket. I got to tell you, halfway into that drive I was sitting there thinking, this is not looking good right now, you know. But you got to keep trusting him, putting him out there because the more minutes he plays, all that will come back. He's so important to our team and he still in a lot of ways organizes our team better than anyone on our floor can do it. So, getting him back is huge for us."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"That's a very -- are you from Vegas? Yeah, I thought so. Laughing. Yeah, I love it as a host city. I mean, this city is a convention, big event city. This is a big event, so it's perfect for this. Yeah, they're going to get it. I don't know this, but I'm assuming Vegas will be in the NBA someday. Baseball is here, football is here, and everything else is here, right? So we need to come, as well. I think it would be great. I think it will happen."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Okay, yeah, preparation. Yeah, we're going to take tomorrow off. The coaching staff never get off, we'll watch film. I think it's a 530 game I don't even know that. So it will be a short day and we're going to have to get a lot of stuff in. There's a chance, you know, if we play Houston, at least we've played them, so that would shorten our work. If we play Oklahoma, we have not seen them this year. That would make us have to work a lot more. So we'll just wait and see and then we'll be ready."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Yeah, you know, I don't. Like, I just wanted to win the Cup. Listen, outside Milwaukee, I think a lot of people was, What's going on? I don't think one person inside thought that at all. We just believed that it was going to click, it was going to happen -- I would make a point of saying we assumed that -- now it is, but we still got a long way to go. I look at our team and I think we have a vast growth that we're going to have to become a better team defensively and offensively. That's what's so exciting about this group, because we have a bunch of veterans who are still changing for some of the new things that we're doing, and it's been great to see."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Yeah, I think you just got to play the game the right way. Especially when you're on a good team. I'm on the floor with a lot of good players, a lot of shooting. You go out there with a guy like Giannis who is going to draw lot of attention when he's getting downhill. So there's really no reason for me to force the action. There's nothing wrong with getting off of the ball and spacing because of that that's been a huge part of our success is allowing the ball to move, and it ends up where it's supposed to when everybody's doing right thing. That's all I did. A lot of catch-and-shoot opportunities came because of our spacing and the guys that I'm on the floor with. It's just up to me to take those shots, be ready to take 'em and make 'em. I started off missing 'em, but I got a lot of clean looks, and I know from experience, when you get a lot of clean looks, the ball might not go in sometimes, but it creates a good rhythm. Like I felt good about the shots that I was getting. The ball felt good coming out when I was shooting it. We were winning the game, so I just continued to stay aggressive, take the shots that was there, and just do the right thing and then eventually it came back around, so that was it, just trusting the game and doing the right thing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I wouldn't say an easiness, but I think we probably looked a little sharper this time around. Last time we were ready, but this time we came into it remembering our last experience. We came correct. We knew it wasn't going to be easy playing against a good team, but we prepared, and it just felt familiar. Didn't feel like a random, new thing. I would say it just felt familiar coming back the second time."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"It's a big play. I think any time you get into a back-and-forth game, where it's a one-possession game and you're playing against a team, and they lead the league in lobs, they've got shooters all over the floor, they score points when you play at a high pace. So once you get down the stretch that last two, three, four minutes, the game comes down to who's going to execute offensively, and who's going to come up with timely stops. Sometimes a good offensive team, they're going to make great plays. That was about to be a great play by them that we defended just fine. Fortunately, we've got two seven-footers in the paint that didn't give up on the play, and we were able to come up with a big stop."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I mean, I play the game, and then I watch the game. I'm somebody, I go home and I try to watch every game if I can. The game of basketball, any time I get an opportunity to watch a game, I'm watching it, whether it's on my phone, iPad, TV, whatever. I'm definitely going to watch the game, and I'm going to watch it with the idea that we're going to be playing one of these teams in a couple days and just seeing what's working for them, what they do. Meanwhile, I've seen them play a bunch of times, both teams. I'm going to watch them both closely knowing we're going to see them in a few days, and obviously we'll do our team prep where we watch film and have practice and break down the things we want to do, once we find out who we're playing, and that's really it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Yeah, I think early in the game, obviously I talk about the pace that they played. They're one of the fastest teams in the league coming down the floor. A lot of times teams that play at that pace offensively, they struggle to get back when the ball is going the other way. I think that's kind of why we were pushing it the other way, because it's hard to get back when you play at that pace. Then as the game went on, it becomes a game where execution matters. You don't want to be pushing through possessions. You want to have good quality possessions. You want to make them have to defend and you want to position guys where you want them to where it's in your favor. That's what we did. We went to that two-man game, me and Giannis, on the clear side, so we had space and there was no extra defender there. We had room in the paint, so they would pre-rotate to Giannis, that high-low was working, and we were able to execute that a few times down the stretch where we started up and nobody was getting it. Nobody ran backside is getting to get that pass over Brook, so us slowing down and just executing to where me and Giannis are the first two guys to make a play, the first two options to make a play, and if not, we were positioned on the weak side to be able to take advantage of it how we wanted to is just how it worked out."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"I mean, obviously we showed throughout this whole Cup that we belong. We can compete with the best of them. Unfortunately, today we came up short. It's just going to give us a lot to learn from moving forward. Especially down the stretch in those last five, six minutes, I've definitely got to be better. Just as a team, we've got a lot of room to grow. But I'm proud of everybody. We defeated a lot of odds coming in, making it all the way to Vegas. There's nothing to hang our heads about. We've just got to keep moving in the right direction."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,This is something you've got to deal with. I'm not going to use that as an excuse. I played terrible tonight. That's just the bottom line. I'm going to go ahead and get treatment and just get ready for the next game and try to be as ready as possible.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"For sure. I think I said previously, we beat some very tough teams to even get to Vegas. Yhat just shows that we're capable of doing it. We're capable of competing with the best teams in this league. So yeah, I think we've learned a lot. We appreciate what we did. And like I said before, we just came up short tonight. Yeah, that's just that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, we just at the end of the day trusted our work. We had the right intentions. Offensively in the first half just didn't make enough shots. They went into the half with a little bit of a lead. Yeah, we trusted our own work and we knew if we kept getting stops, we'd be able to give ourselves a chance, and we did so."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, it's fun. It makes you better. That's what this league is about, competing against the best in the world, and defensively he is that for sure. I like to think that of myself offensively. He gives me a chance to really see where I'm at, a good test. I'd say I handled it pretty well."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, it was pretty sweet. Obviously, I haven't -- we don't play here every year, but yeah, the environment was dope. The fans were into it. A basketball city. It was really fun playing out there."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, I think it would be great. The Cup is here, Summer League is here we can feel the basketball culture in Vegas as players when we come. I think it's only a matter of time. The city really embraces basketball, and they deserve it for sure."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, it does have a little bit -- this had a little bit of like a March Madness feel just because it was like neutral grounds, nobody is home, you're on the road. Like you said, it's single game elimination. It's a little bit of nerves, and once the basketball tips it's just basketball at the end of the day, and you do whatever it takes to win. Obviously, a little bit more is at stake where if you lose you go home, but games like that are good experience for us, especially with where we want to end up."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, he's a special player. He gives everything he has defensively every night, does the dirty work. Some nights he gets two shots, some nights he gets 10 shots, some nights he makes five threes, some nights he doesn't get a three, and he doesn't let it waver. Especially myself, I don't take it for granted, the role he plays for this team. So many guys on the team do that role, but Lu is very special at it, and he has his imprint all over this group with how hard he plays, how physical he plays, how tenacious he is. But with that being said, tonight was a Lu Dort night. Nothing we havent seen before."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, obviously some really good players over there. It's the same every night. We've got to try to make sure that they play in their weaknesses instead of their strengths. It's a lot easier said than done, but if we want to win, we have to get it done, and that will be our main focus."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, he can be, like, very special. As good as he wants to be. He has a really good feel for the game. It's so hard to pick up or teach this far in your career. He just understands how to play basketball, when and where to make reads, and then he works hard, and his skill set is only going to continue to grow because of those things. But yeah, special talent for sure. Obviously for a little bit there he was playing the 5 for us at 6-5 to speak to his versatility. There's so many things he does on the basketball court for us that are on a very high level, it would be stupid for me to give him a ceiling. I think he can go as far as he wants to, as far as he takes it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Yeah, I thought our defense in the first half kept us in the game. For us to shoot that poorly, I think we were 2-for-18 from three, and to be down by one was fortunate. I thought our force on offense in the second half was much better. We kind of relied on jump shots in the early part of that game. We got a little better in the second quarter, but when you rely on jump shots, you're relying on the highest variance shot in the game, and I didn't think we tested the paint and tested transition enough. In the second half we got a little bit more of that and more shots fell, which I think is correlated. Obviously, a great response against a really good defense to have 70 points."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Yeah, he struggles just like any other player, and he struggled in the first half to find it. The thing that always impresses me about him is he just has an unwavering confidence. Regardless of what's going on in the game, his confidence stays at the same level. He continues to play, and the game usually comes around for him because he keeps his head in it and he's a great player, and that's what happened in the second half."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Yeah, I was just talking to Sam. Sam said he thought the play of the game was when he dove on the floor there it was like a tone setter. The game was kind of like a little muddled before that. It's never a surprise. He always brings his fastball. He brings his fastball every night, but the bigger the game doesn't change that as all. I thought his physicality tonight, his effort tonight, obviously made some big shots, as well, he's been in these situations, and he always sticks his nose in the competition, and tonight was no different."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Yeah, it's never an end game for us. We're just trying to be disruptive and disciplined, and we were disruptive tonight. I thought we did a really good job on their main guys. I thought our individual D on those guys was great. Our shot contesting was great. Our help was great. Usually when you do that you can force tough shots or turnovers, and we were able to force both tonight. We had a great defensive game."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Yeah, that's what defense does for you. It keeps you in games. You're never really out of it. The first half was a great example of that. I don't think we've struggled that much offensively all season, a combination of their defense, they did a great job on us, and our offense, our process wasn't great, and we didn't shoot it well. The defense kept that game very manageable for us, and then once we got some mojo going on offense, the defense stayed at that level, and we were able to break the game open a little bit."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"That's a physical team that plays with great intensity. They also have great athleticism. There's a reason they are as good as they are defensively. I thought in the first half we were kind of tiptoeing with the ball, and you really can't do that against that team and expect to crack them, and then in the second half we had more force. The force in the pick-and-rolls allows him to get out for some of the lobs, the force getting into the lane makes the threes higher quality, and we shot it better, obviously, got fouled more. I thought our mentality against their physicality in the second half was much better, and it left a lot to be desired in the first half."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"I said this yesterday, but we have a competitive group of guys. The NBA is competitive. If we line up and practice and play 5-on-5, the guys are killing each other to try to win a scrimmage with nobody watching, and I would imagine it's mostly like that in every NBA gym. So when you put anything on the line, the guys are going to be amped up for that. I think you've seen that from every team throughout the whole Cup, and both teams will bring their fastball on Tuesday."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Yeah, the defense was there right from the jump. To hold them to 41 or 40 in the first half was a great defensive half, and we really forced them away from their strengths, and we put them in a crowd and were able to generate some tough shots and turnovers. We really made them earn everything. Then like I said, the offense wasn't where it needed to be to be like a sustainable source for us, but in the second half we got that going and maintained the defense. That was the difference for us."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I just tried to compete. They came back with like seven minutes to go, eight minutes to go, I don't remember, was trying to get my rhythm going. I feel like sometimes to get your rhythm going, you got to start defensively. Yeah, I wasn't necessarily thinking I'm going to dive on the floor, but at the end of the day I know that I'm trying to win the game and I'll do whatever it takes to win a game. I'm happy that I did, because I feel like it translated to the whole team. You got to do whatever is necessary to close this one out. I'm just proud of my teammates. The way we started the game, we kind of set the tone that we were here to compete. Down the stretch I felt like we could be definitely better in executing, but, yeah, we won the game. We have another one in few days, got to be stay focused, stay humble and try to get the job done."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I've been using my voice throughout my a career. Obviously I played with very experienced players. Growing up when I was younger, 23, 24, 25, all those years, you know, from George Hill, Jrue Holiday, Kyle Korver, Wesley Matthews, Robin Lopez, like they were very, very experienced vets. I believe that as I got more comfortable I become more vocal. Now myself, I view myself as a vet. I view myself like a guy that can help the team, kind of spark something within the team. I just try to use my voice more. I feel like the more I use my voice, the more I'm engaged within the game, and guys not only listen to my voice, but follow my example. I'm trying to go out there and lead by example, which that's what I love to do, but also I know that my voice carries a lot of weight and is very important within the team, so I try to talk as much as I can without allowing my voice to go too much, because I don't like that too much."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"We just got to be able to get to our spots better, give Khris a better outlet, more clean. Obviously in that position you don't make a pass. Once you're able to get it in and it's clean, you don't turn the ball over. I feel like we didn't do that good of a job of hitting our spots. He was smart enough to take the timeout. We went back to the bench, wrote down the play, we were able to get the ball in, gave it to Dame and Dame did his thing. He loves to have the ball down the stretch, get to his spot, and put games away."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"That's one of the teams that is very disciplined. They're going to show the wall for 48 minutes. You just got to stay present and be patient. That's what I felt like we did. Be patient and it's going to come. Sometimes you can break that with a pass, sometimes you can break it by being aggressive. But I was able to make some reads. I think Andre made a shot in the corner, Brook was able to go in the dots and had like a layup. Before that there was a lob to Brook. Then I was able to kind of spread the wealth a little bit more. Then I got to my spot. At the end of the day, as a player, as a leader you got to stay patient. Sometimes it's going to come, sometimes it's not going to come, and happy this game it came."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yeah. I'll be very honest with you. I've watched OKC, I watched Houston play, and I don't know exactly where they are in the standings, but that doesn't matter. We got to get the job done. I think the conversation within the team is that nothing matters, only win. Stats don't matter it doesn't add a win or a loss to our record. Nothing really matters. How many shots, if you go 0-15, if you go 15-15, it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters right here is to get a win, and that's the message within our team right now and everybody got to stay locked in. Everybody got to stay locked in the job's not done."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"It's just winning plays. Just got to keep on doing things to help your team win. Sometimes it's going to be a block, sometimes it's going to be a shot, sometimes it's going to be a pass. It doesn't matter what it is. What matters is just being able to be selfless, sacrifice your body, your own ambitions, goals, to help your team win. You can see on that play both me and Brook went up and tried to get that block. We both fell down, and that's winning plays. That's winning plays. We got to see that clip over and over again and show it within the team that this is what it takes to win games. It doesn't matter if it's a NBA Cup game, doesn't matter if it's a regular season game, doesn't matter if it's a NBA Finals game. To win games, put yourself in a position to be successful, you got to have plays like that. So that's pretty much it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yeah, you know, I feel like the way we set the tone, the winning plays that we have hopefully can carry over to the next game, got to be a little bit sharper executing, play with more confidence, play with more joy. You can't take these moments for granted. We got to put ourselves in a position to win. I think it's going to carry over."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Yeah, that was my first Final Four in Berlin this year. Obviously, the atmosphere is a little bit different, with the crowd, with the Beko crowd, Fenerbahce crowd, Panathinaikos crowd, it's kind of different. You know, I wish we had that atmosphere in the NBA, but we don't. But the intensity within the game, I think it's pretty much the same. Everybody understands that it's one game. You have to play well if you don't, you get knocked out. So the intensity within the game from the teams, you see high level of basketball, teams are competing, as I said the intensity is high, so in that aspect, it's pretty much the same. The only thing that's different I believe is the atmosphere, which I wish that the NBA could have that type of atmosphere here."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 14, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"We're feeling more comfortable, our chemistry is the best it's ever been, and at the end of the day it takes time. I feel like a lot of people had such high expectation from us from day one to be the best duo to ever play this game, but it takes time. Now it's our second year playing together, we are more comfortable playing with one another, we know one another's spots better, and as you see, our chemistry has been getting way, way better. Down the stretch, you know, something that we like to do, we feel very, very comfortable that we can both get to our spots, and we've been more effective when we play that two-man game this year. There's always areas that we can improve, which we will improve, but I'm so happy that we're feeling way, way more comfortable to play that two-man game down the stretch, and we know our spots better."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"Yeah, I feel like this team has been embracing the challenge each and every night from the beginning of the season. We haven't looked too far ahead in any moment. We're just taking it day by day. Even though early on in the season we may have had some struggles and some bumps in the road and some guys out, we stuck with the process and focus on each day. I feel like this Cup we've shown we've done the same thing and not looked too far ahead and just focused on the next opponent."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"For me, I've always said since day one I've always been able to adjust to whatever team I've been around or been a part of or what the coach wants from me, like I've always been able to adjust. The narrative about me not being able to do certain things or being too mad or frustrated about certain things is -- I mean, just aren't true. I think you're just now being able to see like with the young team we have, just some of the different things we've been doing this year, I think just now you're starting to kind of see it because the results are showing and we're winning now. We're here in this final four of the Cup, and it's a big deal. I think that's why you're seeing it and understanding it, but for me I've always been this way. Like I've been this way since high school when I played with the No. 1 player in my class. I wasn't the best player on my team, and I was okay with it. I was able to adjust, and I learned, and I was able to feed and eat off that, and I learned. I learned back then that, when you win, everything else takes care of itself. That's kind of what's happening right now."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"Yeah, we definitely played some really tough teams to get here. Like I said, we just really focused on the next opponent. From Boston, when I didn't even play, everybody went out there and played their tails off and found a way to get a win. Then we just kept playing and building each and every game and just focusing on the next opponent. Now we've got the Bucks and obviously they're a great team, two future Hall of Famers that you've got to be ready for. We know it's not going to be an easy task, but we're definitely up for the challenge and we'll be ready."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"I feel like the more you play, the more experience you have, the more you feel your voice can be heard and people around you will listen to you when you speak up. I feel like that's what you see in Jalen each and every game more and more. The more experience he has and he's continuing to have success throughout the start of this season, you're just going to continue to see him talk more and give more advice, and on the team we're going to continue to hear his voice more and more. The more he gets opportunities and situations and he's playing more. So it's good that he's getting to see some more action this year, and he's helping our team obviously a lot."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"Yeah, great question. I feel like for me it's not like a season-by-season thing on what I change or look at. It's really a night-by-night thing on what the defense brings and what type of defense they're in, whether they're in a drop coverage or whether they're trapping me off the screen. I struggle a lot with turnovers sometimes, and a lot of it comes in the beginning of the games when I'm trying to figure out what kind of defense they're in and things like that. So that's something I can be better at and I'll be better at going forward. But it's more of a nightly basis thing. If they're in drop coverage, if they're blitzing me, if they're hedging, things like that, that's kind of what I look at in the pick-and-roll."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"I don't know. I don't let past things like really make me mad or things like that, like hold a grudge on those things. I'm not like -- yeah, I'm young, but I'm not super young anymore where I let those things really affect me."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",TRAE YOUNG,"I mean, the nutmeg is like -- that's something I've been doing since high school. I always watched CP when he was with the Hornets and things like that when I was young. I would always see him nutmeg guys, nutmeg big men. I started to doing it in high school games and transition and throwing it between guys' legs. I don't know if we need to call it the Trae way, but I do do it a lot. I learned from the guys above me, and the same with my hooping and playing. I mean, KD played a lot of games in OKC, you know what I'm saying? When I was in middle school, I was watching them. They went to The Finals and all those things. So I've had some really great role models that I can look up to from afar and kind of steal bits and pieces from their games. Not just K, but a lot of players, but him specifically. He plays a lot of basketball and runs. From what I've heard and what I've listened to, and conversations with him too, you learn by playing. You are get in shape by playing too. That's something that we can stay in shape and still get better at the same time. That's kind of why I play and never stop playing when the summer starts."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think how hard we play defensively and how together we are as a team. I feel like those two things are what really separate us. Obviously we can score the ball, but on that aspect, it's pretty exciting to watch."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think just like the guys we drafted has been a big part of that. That's one of those like luck of the draw blessings that we have with the team. We're all young, so a lot of the guys that got drafted the year before me have only been in the NBA for like a year longer. So everybody's going through the same phases of their career for the most part. Yeah, I think it just comes down to who we've drafted. We have a real good group of like genuine guys. Then I think we're winning, so that's usually pretty fun."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, like you said, just me personally, I did The Finals correspondence thing. And obviously like the Playoffs, I feel like this is kind of the same vibe, All-Star Weekend and things like that. I think we've done a good job of blocking out the noise. Like I said, we have a team that's so involved with ourselves and we get along so well, this doesn't really feel too new, outside the media circuit. So it's just another game. We're going to go out there and play the way we do usually and let the chips fall where they fall. We've done a good job of just being within the team and understanding what's at stake every time we play."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I think when obviously we're that close, so it's probably a matter of points between who's 1 or 2. I think both teams do a good job of being really physical and playing hard. That seems to be kind of a lost thing early in the year when everybody's trying to figure out how their team wants to play. So you have to give credit to them for how hard they play. They scheme well, and they have a lot of talented players on their team that can defend and want to defend, which is a big one. I feel like that's kind of how we are as a team too. It's always fun playing against them because they give you a playoff feel. Just kind of like later down the line that's kind of what it's going to feel like. It's kind of fun playing against them, and you get to learn more and more about yourself when you play good teams like this."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think it was my sophomore year with like Summer League in Utah, Chet barked, and it kind of was like random, like it wasn't on purpose. I think Twitter kind of got a hold of it and then -- our team's so weird, I don't even remember what happened after that. We started barking after. Chet kind of started it by accident. I think maybe one of the interviewers talking about having a dog mentality or something, and he barked. It kind of just took off from there. I think me and J-Will started doing it, mocking him, and once Oklahoma gets wind of something like that, they usually stick with it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"I don't know, I enjoy it. I think everybody else does. We don't do it every time now, but it's kind of like our identity."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"It's something that we all as a team understand, like just being kind of like a small market team, it's just something that comes with it. But we also embrace it a lot. It kind of adds like a chip to our shoulders to a certain extent. We also like understand how the media and like the coverage works and stuff like that. It's something that's kind of like out of our control. All we can do is win games and kind of make it to a point where you need to see us on TV. That's kind of how we look at it. I don't know if AC follows me on Twitter, so I probably didn't see it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I thought he's done a good job handling everything that's coming to him. Obviously their team is kind of like in a phase where they're still trying to figure stuff out, so I always try to harp on that with him. You're not playing basketball for a year with this team. You're trying to have a stint of 10 to 15 years of playing. It's hard, especially because he's 19, 20 years old. There is a little part of that where there's a little disconnect with me and him because it's like I couldn't imagine coming into the NBA at 19 and obviously playing against these guys. So that speaks to how talented he is. I always try to remind him of that. You're extremely young. You're going to have a lot more years and opportunities to do things. A lot of this year is just getting better and staying focused. You don't want to end the year kind of like the same as you were when you started. So I try and harp on that a little bit. It's a marathon, not a race. Everybody's path is completely different. Like my rookie year is completely different than yours, and that's what makes the experience nice."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"Yeah, for sure. I think it's just a testament to our defense and our approach. It takes a lot of energy and focus, especially for a young group. So I know any time we're locked in on defense usually bodes well for us, and then it becomes a possession game toward the end of the game. You want to close it out. Most of the time we're not scoring either. But for the most part, being able to hold teams under their average, especially now with the way the scoring is, I think is a testament to our group as a whole."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"Yeah, it will come. We're still a young group playing together, figuring it out. We've got young players. We haven't been together that long, still figuring out what works. Guys are still figuring out their own games. But as long as we guard on a night-to-night basis, we have a chance to win. The goal in mind obviously is to have a better flow and rhythm and be able to find that rhythm more consistently, especially toward the end of the season."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"It's been fun. It's been fun. I haven't had this much fun playing in a long time. Just to be a part of these guys' journey and success you see, being able to enjoy the little things again. After winning a championship, you kind of get spoiled and jaded. You just always focus on getting back to that mountaintop, which is hard to do. To be back with a group that is just excited to win, you saw the reaction the other night when we won to go here. So getting back to enjoying the little things and the small victories, but also trying to be that example for these guys to know kind of what it looks like when you win big."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"I think I always just focus on winning. I was just trained and developed as a kid to be a winner, and the only thing that matters is wins and losses. So however that comes about for each individual is different. For me, it was just trying to find impact. Whether that's defensively making plays or getting guys shots or making my teammates better, I try to bring value wherever I go and make everyone around me better wherever I go. That's something I've had some success doing."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",FRED VANVLEET,"Yeah, like I said, I think it's fun. We're excited to be here. I wouldn't say we're happy to be here, in terms of we're just happy to be here. We want to win. We want to win the whole thing. That was our goal from the beginning is to win the championship. Just getting here wasn't really our goal. But it's new. It's new to everybody. I think I watched LeBron James pop champagne in December of last year, you know what I mean? I don't know if anybody could have ever imagined that 20 years ago. So it's new. It's new to everybody. I'm just enjoying it, staying in the moment and enjoying the moment. Just realizing what we're building for our group may be different from everybody else, but we're on our own journey and our own path. Just reminding our guys to stay in the moment and go out there and play your butt off."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"I'd say we're a deep, athletic, physical team. That's what we're trying to build. Been good on the defensive end, defensive minded, like to junk it up, be aggressive on that end. Unselfish and balanced on offense. Yeah, that's the reputation we have kind of formed. The identity we want to form is playing with effort and traditionally getting stops and playing good defense. Offensively, we're a work in progress. Some young guys coming along and making strides. That's why we are where we are."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"Yeah, I'd say we have to be more consistent, for sure. There are things we do really well that have helped us in those numbers. Sometimes it simply comes down to shooting, and if those numbers increase from the shooting aspect, obviously we'll take a step there as well. A lot of teams are trying to keep us out of the fast break situations. Our defense turns into offense, which has been really good. But in the half-court at times, when we get bogged down and the ball sticks a little bit or we're missing shots, it affects us there. Shooting numbers strictly can help us improve there. But I think we do some things really well -- crashing the offensive glass, getting out in transition when we can. That will be the biggest step with our young guys, like I mentioned, taking steps in growth as far as facilitators and understanding what the defense is trying to take away from them."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"I think he's one of the best scorers, obviously, in the league. A lot of teams are sitting back and trying to make him beat you at jump shots, specifically threes, and I think he gets a head of steam and kind of he's on his front foot and you're kind of in retreat mode. So we want to pick up a little bit higher, be more physical, I think, show him a crowd a little bit more and give him some indecisiveness as far as that. Just don't want to leave guys on the island the whole time. He's had his way there a few times against us, especially in the first game, but did a little bit better the second game. He's a tough challenge, no doubt, because of his pace and his patience, and he usually makes the right read."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"Yes, I think it's good to play in those different situations that you mentioned. For a lot of guys that haven't tasted the playoffs yet, it's the closest thing to that as far as intensity and physicality and something on the line. Meaningful basketball is really good for our young guys. They haven't had a ton of those games. We did last year somewhat at the end of the season, playing for something. We were still in the mix. To make it here and obviously try to take another step will help us grow in those areas in going through those things for the first time. We have vets that have been there, done that, as well as coaches. For them to go through it for the first time, they said they could feel the intensity. The crowd was different. The environment was different. To pass that step and to have to take on another good team here will be a good test for us. But all these things are invaluable for our growth."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"Just accomplishment, a feather in your cap. It's something obviously new to the league, but for us it's growth for our young guys and a chance to play in, like I said, some meaningful, different games. In general, just something that I think players have really responded well to in the league. Kind of takes the dull moments of the early season away and gives you something to play for. It's an honor to be here. We felt we did well in our group to get here. Now we just want to make some more noise while we're here and not just be happy and satisfied that we're here."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"I'd say you definitely have to be disciplined against them. We're the top two defenses, so very stingy on that end."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"I'd say there's only one or two high-level scorers on every team, guys that are averaging in the 20s most of the time. So not to limit yourself or anything, but understanding ways to impact the game. You can do that with defending, obviously, and that's an effort thing, a mentality thing that everybody can have. Then the guys that are natural scorers do their thing, and we're trying to encourage them to be more well rounded as well. For us, it's just ever since I played, that was me, but also the teams that I've coached with understand the importance of that and how it impacts winning. For me, something simple as that is non-negotiable. If you're going to win at a high level, you have to be able to do that. All of our, quote, unquote, non-defenders that have really grown in those areas, we've seen them grow in the last year or two. In general, there's only a few guys that can really score at that level that really impact the NBA game like that. But there's other ways you can get in and carve out a role and a niche in the league."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",IME UDOKA,"I saw some great effort. Obviously, we had to make some shots to get back in it, but we really locked down on that end. I think we were pretty stingy all game for them to only have 90 in general, but the last minutes when we had to have stops, we got them. Our activity was great, especially on Curry. I think Alperen did an amazing job of moving his feet and taking him away from his shots there. Yeah, it was more so than me focusing on the last foul, it was everything that led up to it, which was getting the stops, getting those rebounds and getting the scores, but also timely possessions, time-and-score that we attacked and got quick baskets and got us into that two-for-one situation late in the game. I love how Fred got on the floor and Jalen got on the floor to even be in that position. The refs call what they call, and you kind of live through that. But also to take and make those big free throws late in the game. Jalen did that credit to him. I love how we guarded at the end. Overall for the game, we have six or so 24-second violations against a pretty high-level offensive team, you're doing some good things."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"I do know what it means, yeah. I'm going to just keep it between us."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"You're not supposed to see that. I guess we would talk about it as continuous improvement. That's something that I think is at the core of what this team needs to do and what we're trying to do. Being focused not as much on the result of any one game, but how we play and understanding that this is a group that, particularly Jalen and Dyson and Zac, they're young. The importance of us growing as a team, how we play as a group, playing together, moving the ball, playing defense, and understanding those things don't come overnight. There's just got to be a consistent commitment, and hopefully that yields results over time. If we can continue to play that way, we've got a chance to continue to get better. I don't know when the payoff is. This is great. This is a great experience for our guys, but again our focus is on how we play and how we play together and playing as a team."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,I'm going to speak to you privately. It's something we've talked about as a coaching staff for a long time. It's not new.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"I think the word that, when we talk with Trae and we talk about Trae, the word I like to use is evolution. Every player evolves. They just evolve in different ways. He's been an important part of our young guys' growth and being able to elevate them and some of the things that I was mentioning earlier. Trae has, I think, taken pride in how he defends, particularly on individual matchups, whether he's switched on to somebody. One of the biggest things for him has been, even when he's in help situations, getting involved on the defensive glass. So there's some specific things that he's really focused on. We know what a talented offensive player is, but I think in his mind being successful as a team, not just Trae, we've all got to do our part defensively, and he's doing that. That's really as much as anything. I don't think he'd object, he's not going to be -- he's not Dyson, and Dyson is not Trae. We're a team, and I think that's the important part. Everybody has their strengths. Everybody has things they need to work harder at and focus on a bit more. He's done that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"No disrespect to Darvin, we'll talk about De'Andre first. I think I was mentioning earlier like how a team plays and how a player plays. With Dre, he's always put in time. Putting him in a situation in games that are high percentage situations for him and him putting himself in those situations."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"Let me qualify that because I think what I was trying to refer to was the payoff being just the growth of the team. To me, this is part of that process that hopefully can give us that opportunity to grow. This is a unique experience for all the reasons that you guys are here and we're here. It does provide, I think, some of those opportunities. We're a group that's trying to develop an identity. Having some success can help that. It can also prevent -- or create challenges too. I think losing and failing as much as none of us want to see that happen, can have the same impact. I think for our group that's what we have to stay focused on. I think you can do that without diminishing any one game or experience, whatever the team may be. I think it's that consistency that over time creates an identity. To me, that's the most important thing for our group is to continue to grow. When you do something over and over and over again, it becomes potentially who you are, and we haven't done that. We haven't done that yet, but that takes time."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",QUIN SNYDER,"It's something we talk about, and the word that I really want him to grab onto is presence. I think he's someone, aside from a pass or a shot or a dunk, to have a presence on the floor, whether he's in a timeout, coming out of the game, coming into the game, at a free throw play, free throw line, whether he's a shooter. Whatever it is, I think great players, you can feel them. That's something that he wants. That's a little more nuanced than I want to make my corner three more. I think those things are all really connected. It's something I think he believes in and wants, and him having a presence is a big thing for our team."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"I like the tournament. I think it's a really, like a litmus test for the team. I look at last year, and I thought Indiana, do they make the Eastern Finals if they don't have this tournament? It gives you a free practice run in playoff situations. It's not the exact same. For us we got off to a rocky start, and now we're here. So I think this tournament can do a lot of different things for a lot of different teams. So I like it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"That's not our problem. Everyone had the chance to get here, and you can't tell me everyone wasn't trying to get here. The teams who are here earned it, and they should be here."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"I mean, I don't know. I'm smart, but I don't know the future. I'm hoping. I guess it says something. It doesn't say nothing. That's what I would say to all that. But how many games in the year? I've learned from being in this job for a long time, you don't overreact to a fast start, you don't overreact to a bad start. Everyone else does, but the teams who are in it shouldn't. Coaches certainly don't. Then the key is being ready at the end of the year. That's the key. But this does help everybody who's in it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"The swagger, I don't think anyone cared about. At least from a coach's perspective, if you don't have some kind of confidence or swag, you can't be a good player. You definitely can't be a great player. I just think his ability to keep everyone involved. He's always done it. He finally broke Doc Rivers' assist record. It only lasted 39 years. So when he came up to me and bragged about it, I said it took you long enough."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,It was personal last year when I was trying to get the Hawks to trade him so I can keep the record. Now it's no longer personal laughter.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"I don't know if the prime years is changed honestly because I think -- prime is basketball IQ and physicality having a collision at the same time. That's what prime means, for the most part. So I don't know if prime comes earlier than it did 20 years ago, 30 years ago. Maybe it does because guys come into the league earlier, so maybe that is true. I don't know that. Physically he's in a great place. I think IQ mentally he's probably in the best place of his career. I think it says that by his numbers, by his passing, by his ability to read defenses. Even in the short time I've been here, it's light years seeing how well he handles different situations defensively when teams are trying to do different things to him, and his numbers say that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Ten years? I don't know. That's all like luck too and health and will, if you want to do it. Guys are in way better condition. We have 1,000 physical therapists on every team now. You think about it, we had Joe OToole. He was our trainer, our PT, our equipment manager, our travel secretary. That's who we had for my whole eight years. No one worked on your body. Now all these guys are in so much better shape. They have so much more information about their bodies. They have so many avenues to go work on their bodies. But I still think it comes down to the will, do you still want to play."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"I think Giannis just has the drive. I think Giannis wants to win in everything he does. That helps your team. Checkers, it doesn't matter, he just wants to win. He's deadly serious about his profession. He's been a joy to coach in that way. If it's something about basketball and something about anything we want to change or anything, he is on board. From a coaching standpoint, nothing easier than that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,We're the old team.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,That's a great question. I don't know the answer. Some of our guys have been on big stages. We have five guys that have been to The Finals and won it. Some have never been on a big stage. Every year your team's on a different journey. I just think mixing those two groups together and seeing how we react is a good thing. It's a great teacher. I'll learn something through this. I just don't know what it is. Every team will get something out of this that will help them moving forward.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"No, what LeBron is doing is maybe -- who knows because of health again, it could happen again. I just don't see it. Like I always tell Giannis when we started watching film together, I tell him all the time, like with Giannis, you're 1 of 1. There's nobody like Giannis. We've never seen anybody like Giannis, and we've never seen anybody like LeBron. LeBron is deadly serious about taking care of his body. Most people wouldn't do what LeBron does off the floor, and that's why they don't last. LeBron has decided to do it all, and that's why he lasts. But it's amazing to watch."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DOC RIVERS,"Zero, honestly. We loved it, started out 20-0 like everybody else, but I don't think the title is going to be given this week. I'm positive of that. Honestly, we just worry about us. We let everybody else worry about all the other stuff. We got off to a tough start, played poorly, couldn't make shots, couldn't defend. Rough schedule, injuries. We had a lot of stuff. So will every team at some point go through all that. That's why, again, I said earlier, you don't overreact to a great start, you don't overreact to a bad start. If you believe in your team, if you think your team has a chance to be a really good team by the end of it, you just try to build through the year."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I mean, not really. I think the one thing that you do get out of the NBA Cup that's similar to the playoffs is just high stakes. You get in these games -- like we had a game at Detroit. Both of us were undefeated in the tournament. We had to go on the road. It's like regardless of who you're playing, you're on somebody else's home floor, the winner moves on. The loser is done. So it's just a lot on the line. It requires you to focus. You've got to come and get the job done. So I think in that way it's similar to a playoff experience, just that you got to get the job done. Then we play against Orlando. We end up in a dogfight again. You've got to get the job done or this is it. So I think it does in that way. But, obviously, for us, we had a tough start to the season. We've gotten ourselves going in the right direction. We've been able to win a lot of games lately. This is just another opportunity for us to continue that, obviously, but with more on the line and with us to get even more momentum from an experience like this."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I would love to say, oh, I knew, but the truth is you just never know. You never know what could make a team just keep going in that direction. I would say the one thing that I didn't lose faith or confidence in is just my interactions with Giannis. For me, I'm always a competitor, and I'm always optimistic. I always think the tide is turning. Every time, there's opportunity to start going in the right direction. I would be texting with Giannis, and we'd be talking at practice or whatever. His mind was never shut off. He was never discouraged. He was never overly concerned. It was always fight. Our conversations had always been, like, we're going to turn it around. We're going to figure it out. We're going to lead. We've got to keep going. We've got to dominate. That was the conversation, and that's my spirit naturally. Just to be in a situation like that and to see that that's his spirit naturally as well, that's what made me just believe. I wasn't overly concerned because I knew that eventually it would turn around just based off of that. We had a great training camp. I think the energy with our team was always good. So just because of those things, I just felt like eventually we'll hit our stride. It's just a matter of us keeping our minds in the right place and us staying together, and we did that. We were able to get ourselves right."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Obviously, I watch each game, and I watch it as my biggest critic. So I'm always looking for the things I could do better. I think this season on the ball I've been good. I think off the ball there's times where I relax or I have lapses or I get behind on certain plays. But I think it's definitely been an area where my energy and my effort has been there. It's something that I focused on, just taking the challenge of being part of our team improving defensively. That's all it is for me. Obviously, being aggressive offensively, attacking, making plays and being a point guard, being the brains behind how we play and what we do offensively. Then defensively just doing my job."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"Coming into the season, I just told our coaches -- they told me that they would regardless, but I just said, whatever you all want to challenge me on or show me on film or whatever you want to do, the effort is going to be there. I'm embracing improving however they see I need to improve."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think it's definitely on its way to carrying some weight. I think last year most people didn't even understand what was going on until it got to the final stages, and then you realize, oh, some teams are going to Vegas. You might have got two games in and you lost two games already, and it's like, oh, now I get it, but we don't have a chance. Then when we got to the game against New York last year where the winner got to go to Vegas, we started to have a better understanding of what was on the line. Then coming into this season, I think everybody understood better and everybody cared more, not just because it's an opportunity to win money. Your teammates who don't make a lot of money got the opportunity to make some extra money. You get an opportunity to come to Vegas and do something outside the norm in the middle of our regular season. But it's an opportunity to win something. It's something that every team is competing for, and then you get here and there's only a few teams that can win it. It can energize and lift your team up to come here and be the team, the last one standing. Even though it's not the ultimate goal, I think it gives you an edge. It gives something to a team. For us, we want all of those things. We want to be the last team standing in it. We want to win the tournament. We want to win the money. We want to continue going in the right direction as a team. I think as the years continue to go by, I think it will be -- like I said, it will carry more and more weight. People will start to care more and more about it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",DAMIAN LILLARD,"For me, it's not even -- I'm not 22 or 23 years old. I've been to Vegas many times, and I've had fun in Vegas. I've been here for Summer League playing. I've been here during Summer League. I've been here for a lot of fights. I'm a big boxing fan. I know what I'm here for this time, and it is not to enjoy Vegas. I'll have some dinners. My family being back on the West Coast, I'm from the West Coast. So my family being able to come here and visit, being able to see them. But we came here to win the tournament. I don't really have no plans other than practice, play in the games, see my people and that's it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"We're going in the right direction, I will say that. I don't think we're near our best yet. Even though we've been winning, I think we can still get a lot better. We're all still winning to learn and grow in many areas. We're doing a great job defensively and offensively, as you said. Just got to keep stacking days with that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,Winning. I'm enjoying the wins that we're getting.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"I think we're all a pretty tight-knit group. We're all relatively around the same age. That kind of helps, especially locker room-wise and team chemistry-wise. I think we're doing a great job of just holding each other accountable. Nobody's afraid to say anything to each other. We're all open to constructive criticism. That's sometimes tough. Everybody has an ego in their own way. We've done a great job of just listening to one another, and I think that's what's going to help us win at the end of the day. If we can continue to do that, that's going to be good."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"Yeah, I'm 22, but I'd say I'm pretty mature for my age. My priorities are winning this NBA Cup. So I got to -- I'm not focused on all the other antics and going out in Vegas. We're just focused on going out here and getting a win."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"Maybe grabbing a dinner. I might do that with my family, but other than that, no."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"Trae is just so -- he's so good, man. It's crazy, like just seeing it in person and on TV prior to me playing with the Hawks and getting drafted by the Hawks, it was crazy just watching it -- a guy that's undersized, being able to score at will, being able to make any pass at will. And then next thing you know you're his teammate and you're on the receiving end of those passes. Watching those clutch late game buckets, it's a joy to watch. It's a gift that he has that's very special and not many people have had it at that elite of a level. It's been great being his teammate. It's been a blessing. We're just looking to continue to grow together as a duo, as a unit, and especially as a team, so yeah."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"I think that G League experience that I had coming in was a very humbling, but an experience that was much needed for my development, not only as a basketball player, but as a man, as a guy that's maturing every single day, I needed that. It humbled me in a way that allowed me to enjoy the process a lot more than I did previously. I didn't really embrace every single day as its own new day. Coming up in college and high school, I was always looking forward, ahead, and planning out future things instead of just staying in the present and allowing me to be where my feet are at. I think that whole experience allowed me just to -- like I said, just embrace the grind and just take everything slow because I know the work I put in at the end of the day. I know how hard I work in the offseason, during the season. I think that just allowed me to continue to get better, man."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"I think the biggest thing, man, is just staying in the gym. Staying in the gym consistently and constantly pushing yourself. Even if you don't see results right away, I can attest to it that it's going to come. It's going to come, and eventually you're going to be more comfortable in certain situations that you weren't comfortable before. I still remember checking into my first NBA game the stomach turning I had. Now when I go out there, it's a whole different feeling I have as far as -- it's weird, it's like I'm playing in high school again, like the feeling and the joy that you get from playing basketball. It's a lot more comfortable you get. I think you've just got to stay the course, man, and keep your head down and work and be a sponge. I think that's one thing I also learned too is that you've got to ask questions in this league. You've got to learn from what other people have been through, different experiences. Not everybody has been through the same experience. So being able to absorb knowledge from this guy and that guy, like you're going to eventually learn and pick up a lot and create your own identity throughout."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN JOHNSON,"It just allows Coach to kind of put me in spots wherever he needs me at, and I think that's the fun part about it. It's like wherever he needs me, whatever he needs me to do at that certain time, I have the capabilities of doing that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN GREEN,"I would say we're pretty locked in. This will be a big moment for us as a team, collectively coming out and being able to show who we is. I think we'll be able to show that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN GREEN,"If we win it, then it shows that we're ready. I've said it, I think all of my teammates have pretty much said it, that the goal is the playoffs. I think the atmosphere and the play style of the Cup is similar to the playoffs. So we're getting a taste of it right now."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN GREEN,"They're going to do preparation, just locking in with the trainers and stuff. I'm pretty sure everybody's got a routine we can lock into, or that they can lock into themselves. Yeah, they've just got to do it, staying ready, things like that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN GREEN,"Yeah, communicating is a big thing. You've got to let your man know when he messes up. He's got to let you know when you're messing up. That's called holding each other accountable. If you can't do that, there's no growth. But I think we all do a pretty good job of that."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",JALEN GREEN,"He's been a big, big plus for us, his poise and just being calm with the ball. We're a young team. We tend to get sped up and stuff. So him coming in and be able to slow the game down and get us in our spots and run the offense for us has been very big."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Yeah, playing against a guy that I'm close with obviously, but when we both get out there, we're competing. We're trying to take each other's heads off, and we're both after winning basketball games and winning this Cup. So it won't be friendly tomorrow, but we can deal with it after."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Just my music friends is who I get that from. Whoever you listen to, I'm cool with. I get to listen to music a little ahead of time. Then Dub is just bored at home and breaking out my captions. But the captions just like, they just come to me. Whatever's going on, whatever's trending, whatever's -- I just sit there for a bit, think a little bit and pop it out."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I just try to make whoever I'm guarding play on their weaknesses. The NBA is full of really, really good players. You're not always going to be successful. But trying as much as often to get them to play within their weaknesses and not their strengths, I've found a little bit of success."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It would mean a lot. It's the opportunity to win, play the game at a high level. As a kid, you tie your shoes up and play AAU ball to win the tournament at the weekend. You go to college to try to win NCAA Tournament or the tournament at the beginning of the season, the Maui Invitational, whatever it's called. You're always trying to win. That's my mindset. That's my teammates' mindset. You're always trying to win. So it would be an opportunity for us to win and do something we love every day, play basketball."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"No, not at all. Like any basketball game, I don't see it as anyone should win before the game tips. You go out there, and you have to earn the victory. Now, what that looks like every night is going to change, but you have to go out there and earn it. You'd be a fool to think that you deserve to win before you go out there and do so. So I don't have that mindset in any game I play really."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Part of it is our rim protectors. They do such a good job that it allows us to gamble sometimes and be aggressive, knowing that they're behind us to clean stuff up. But calling it like it is, we have a lot of guys that are really good defensively, just like their hands and instincts. Obviously, Caruso is proven. Lu is special. Cason's hands are really good. Dub guards all five positions at 6-5. We have a lot of guys who instinctually are really good at defense, and then at the end of the night, we all try to compete. When you mix those two together, it's pretty good defensively."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"I watch a lot of basketball. One thing I've noticed is winning, it takes the same ingredients no matter what level. At the end of the day, you can implement that in any situation. Myself and Coach obviously, Lu, I think we've been here the longest, K-Rich. We try to make sure we stay true to those core values that we have as a team and an organization and allow players that are coming in to understand what they're coming into. And then that's what we hold them to as a standard. From there, it keeps everything consistent and keeps our standard consistent. We have built on that and got better at that. Then you add getting better as players, and the sky's not the limit. We can go as far as we want to. But I think we have a really good foundation, and that's allowed us to ascend."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"It's fun. As a kid, you grow up, you watch Lakers versus Boston on TV. You watch Miami versus Cleveland. You watch marquee matchups and you watch big games, and you dream about getting there one day. To be in this position is special. You don't take it for granted. At the end of the day, you just want to win. But it's pretty sweet to be highlighted and showcased in a way. Yeah, it's what dreams are all about, and for them to come true is special."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Jordi is a really good coach. We obviously spent the last two summers together and achieved some special things. Yeah, he has a way he's trying to play basketball. He holds his players accountable, and that way he plays basketball. Players know what to expect from him, and because of that steadiness, it's easy to play for him. I think that's why you're seeing them have the success they've had. They go out there. They play hard. They play together. They play free. They're all aggressive. They're all in attack mode. They all can shoot. They're all ready to shoot. Yeah, he instills confidence in his players. You're going to get the best out of your players because of that. I think that's why we've seen them excel the way they have."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"Absolutely. He's just going to continue to grow, continue to get better. Yeah, he's doing a great job."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"Honestly, I think the biggest thing it can present is we're in a different environment now than we're used to. We're in a non-NBA market. It's kind of a departure from the season, everything from this to the shootaround is different and great opportunity for distractions to take our focus off of what we need to do on the court. Ultimately, if you have success, you have to handle more and more distractions and cut through those and stay present through those, and this is an opportunity for us to do that. Aside from that, we're trying to normalize it and treat it like any other game, which it is obviously."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"We have great respect for Houston. They've had a great season so far. They're very difficult to play against because of their physicality, athleticism, intensity. They play with great intensity every night. They play to a high bar. It starts with the respect we have for an opponent. It's hard to score on an opponent if you don't respect them, and we certainly respect them. There's ways we try to crack them. There's ways they try to crack us. Our understanding of each other compounds over time. This will be our third time playing them, plus times from last season. It's possession by possession. It's trying to gain advantages on offense and negate advantages on defense, but it's easier said than done the better the team is, and Houston is a very good team."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"I think we've shown uncommon poise and presence over time through kind of our rise, dating back to when we were winning 24 games, and there were distractions that came with that. Then our Play-In year, where we were like a .500 team or so, and then last year, I think the team has continued to do a great job of staying present with the next challenge in front of us, continuing to focus on improving and growing through all the different experiences, not riding the emotional waves that come with that. You're only as good as you are in the next challenge, in the next hurdle. So none of that stuff counts for our ability to do it now. We've got to replicate that both in how we behave off the court and how we play on it."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"I don't really have any expectations. We still have 70-something percent of the season remaining. We're still in the mode of trying to grow as a team. You don't want to be a finished product in December. You want to be a growing team that's building momentum through the experiences of the season, and the only way to do that is to focus on improvement. Regardless of where our record lands us right now, it doesn't count for anything in December. So we're trying to build ourselves. We're trying to flex -- strengthen our muscle throughout the course of the season. We're bumping up against different challenges that we're having to overcome. We're having to solve different puzzles. Players are changing and growing and evolving because we have young players still, and it's critical we see them as unfinished products that are constantly improving. We're really trying to stay focused on that regardless of where it lands us in the standings or what the outcome of any game is. We continue to bet on that and hope and trust that that will land us in the most fully actualized version of our team that we can get to this season and in seasons in the future."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",MARK DAIGNEAULT,"I think at the essence players are competitive. When we have practice and half the team in blue, half the team in white and we put a scoreboard on and it's time to compete, they play really, really hard. I would expect that to be the case for 29 other teams. I think you're talking about people who have ascended to the most competitive level they could possibly ascend to as players. Competition turns them on regardless of the circumstance. If it's competition in the NBA Cup, they're going to try to win it. If it's competition on a Tuesday night in January, they're going to try to win. If it's competition in a practice, they're going to try to win. That's why they're all players in the NBA. So, yes, they're excited about the competition, but they're always excited about the competition. I think this team has proven that in a lot of different contexts."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"For sure. Especially with a team like Atlanta. I think last game they had like 22 offensive rebounds. Against us, they had like 14 or 16. Yeah, we've definitely got to do a better job boxing out and getting more rebounds and starting that offense."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"No, like no matter what happens on the court, no matter our record, I don't think you can pressure your teammates to come back and he's not 100 percent ready. You want him to be fully healthy so when he stays on the floor, he's comfortable, he's able to help the team, and he's not out there being unsure about his health and his rhythm. So I don't think at any point in my mind I was thinking about Khris coming back. The number one thing, I've been with Khris for 12 years now, I always want him to be out there when he's fully healthy. I think it goes both ways. He wants me to be out there also when I'm healthy, not when I'm overcompensating. But at the end of the day, I feel like in the beginning of the season, when we were 2-8, it's a feeling you don't like, like nobody likes losing. Everybody plays to win, I believe. I think we definitely had as a team a little bit more urgency, we had to fix some things. We had to play more team basketball. We had to compete at a higher level. We had to play, we had to create better circumstances for our teammates for them to be great. Because Damian and me, we're going to figure things out on the court, but we have TP, GT, Brook, Bobby, AJ, Andre Jackson, all the guys that come from the bench or next to us, we have to be better to make it easier for them and set the table for them. I think me and Damian came together and realized that's very important. From the time we did that, we've been 9-2. The last 11 games, we've been playing great basketball. Now it's definitely a plus having Khris back because, man, he takes us to the next level with his IQ, decision-making, shot ability, defense. So it's great to have him back, and it's even better to have him back now that he's 100 percent healthy. We don't have to kind of worry about something, knock on wood, happening to him."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Thank you.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I've thought about it. What he's done is incredible, never been done, especially at the level he's playing. For me I always look at the other players that kind of set the blueprint for us, and this is something that's never been done before. Now moving forward, it's something that I always think. I'm like I definitely want to play late into my career, like 37, 38, 39, as much as my body can allow me to play. But I have to do a good job of taking care of my body, which I think I believe I do, but he kind of set the path for us, set the blueprint for us. We've just got to follow. Whoever wants to follow has the blueprint. So I want to follow that. Now, not everybody's the same. You've got to not only involve -- not only do you have to take care of your body. You've got to involve your game too, kind of change your game. There's so many things that plays a big role for you to be able to play until 40. But it's something that, definitely, if I can do it, I'll do it. If I can play until I'm 45, I'll definitely play until 45. If not, it is what it is."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Coach Ham too.
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"Taurean Prince, Coach Ham."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"For me, every game is important. Every game, I play to win. I only know one way to play, I always try to play hard. I think it was important for all the teams that were here last year. We wanted to win the Cup, but unfortunately, we didn't. I think we had a good chance to make it to the finals, but down the stretch, I remember the last two mintues we turned the ball over, they make a couple of shots and we weren't able to win that game. Hopefully this year we can kind of erase that bad taste we have in our mouth from last year, but I think there's importance for all the teams this year. Every Cup game that we've played this year, we've been extremely locked in, we play to win. That's why we're here. Now, that doesn't mean we're going to necessarily be the championship team, but I hope we play good basketball tomorrow and the few days after that and we're able to lift that cup."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I wasn't. I wasn't thinking about In-Season Tournament games, to be honest with you. It was a game. The only thing that changed for me was the basketball court, actually like the court, the color of the court. So at the end of the day, we were playing very, very bad basketball at the beginning of the year, and we just needed to win games. Like our goal is to make it to the playoffs, make a deep run, and hopefully we can put ourselves in position to win a championship. By playing the right way, by playing team basketball, by going out there and competing, sometimes you put yourself in the position to be here, and that's what I think we did. I don't think anybody was, okay, this is the In-Season Tournament on Thursday, we got to play 150 percent then so make it to Vegas. I don't think that was our mindset. We were just trying to turn the season around for us. We were bad. Now we've been competing, we've been playing better, guys are together, and we've had a great stretch. We've just got to keep it going. It doesn't matter if we're playing in Vegas or playing in Milwaukee or playing in the NBA Finals. We've just got to keep focusing ourselves and playing good basketball and try to win games, as many games as we can."
2024 - EMIRATES NBA CUP,"December 13, 2024",GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"No, so far I've been having fun. As you said, last year we didn't have a lot of time to rest. I think we played the Knicks in Milwaukee, then we flew in after the game and got to Vegas at 400 a.m. The next day we had practice at noon, so we weren't able to rest. Then the next day we played the game at 1230, which was kind of hard. And the team that we faced, they were here the day before, so they had a little bit more time to get accustomed to Vegas, to everything, to the environment. But I don't think there's anything to change. I kind of enjoy my room. My room is nice. The arena here is nice. You guys make it feel real. I overheard a couple players while we were walking in, and they said, oh, wow, this is real. That's how I felt last year. So it's a good environment. I love it. I love playing against the best players, tough games, good environment. Like so far I've been having fun. So I don't think there's anything to change."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"I thought our coaches did a good job on trying to figure out how to make it more difficult. He's so ultra-talented and causes rotation almost as soon as he crosses half-court. I thought our guys understood what we were trying to accomplish, and I think at times we did. I don't think we did anything of note the first six minutes of the second half. I do think the first half we were somewhat on the same page in how to defend 2 Harper and how to defend 4 Bailey. Coach Pikiell is such an underrated tactical coach. I know he's such a great person and everybody talks about that, but 2 and 4 are really good, but he also puts them in position to be really good. Then in some regards we did okay on those guys, but what he was doing with those other guys was causing us just as many problems. So I didn't think we were near as good in the second half, particularly at the start. He was -- I mean, 37 points a game in Vegas, he was so good."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"Thanks for saying that. He's worthy of a few tweets. Analytically prior to Vegas his numbers were through the roof. We didn't start him on Tuesday, and I thought the job he did against 11 on Wednesday and, to your point, what he accomplished as far as offensively, it's -- we did some other good things offensively, but what he has given us on both ends of the floor in eight games from a consistency standpoint, we've been able to rely on. Over the last two games, I was telling him in the handshake line, like he's not the MVP, but you could argue he's been our MVP in Vegas. He's just in a really good groove. He's very mature, fast twitch brain, has been with us for a while, knows exactly what we're trying to accomplish, is an excellent leader. His consistency on the court and off the court, we have benefited from in Vegas."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I agree with everything you said. I've lost my voice, so I should have called on you to talk during timeouts because a lot of what you just said was what we were trying to do."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",I do think this,"I think that our response to adversity on Tuesday was really poor considering our experience and our maturity, and I think the response from Tuesday going into Wednesday was outstanding. But I did think that today at halftime, I thought there were some things we could have been better at. We had a little bit too many live ball turnovers. We were doing a great job getting fouled. In stretches we were doing a good job of not fouling them. Number 2 was averaging 12.5 points from the free-throw line here. Every game they've played, they've attempted at least 20, and in Vegas they've attempted over 25. That's a crazy number. I didn't think of the 15 that we shot, I was okay with 12 or 13. They scored 23 points in the second half, called timeout. We made some changes obviously to try to muck the game up to try to change the rhythm, to change the pace. In some regards, I think we did a good job of that. But our maturity and our experience together, I thought the last 8 to 10 minutes, was probably the swing vote for us."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"It was bad. It was great at the start. It was -- sorry, finish your question. Sorry."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"We're so reliant on our offensive rebound percentage since we've lived in Texas. Like it's become part of the fabric of how we try to play, and we probably coach rebounding on both sides of the ball more than I ever have anywhere, and it's the only bucket that I coach. It's the only film that I show. We grade every possession all five players on both sides of the ball every game, and it overwhelms our program. I thought we were good offensively personal-wise at half. We were a little below where we needed to be defensive rebounding percentage-wise. A little bit of why the numbers ended up so bad were, in my opinion, we played zone more possessions in November than we have any February since we've lived here. We haven't practiced it very much, but we were in a Hail Mary situation. Like we've got to try something. And we played zone 18 possessions, they scored 15 points, but 8 of those 15 were on the offensive glass. Some of that -- some of that was we're not really good at our roles out of the zone relative to rebounding. Most of that was they just kept whipping our ass. This was the worst we've been on the glass offensively and the worst we've been on the glass defensively, and that's a credit to them. But a portion of that is we weren't just very good in the zone to finish the possession."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"He's just such a nice guy. I love coaches no matter what the sport is, and I really love coaches who overachieve, that nobody ever thought they would make it to the highest level. It's very rare that any coach at any level in any sport overachieves at the rate that he has at historically difficult jobs. To be able to hang around and hang around and still be such a good human being and has had such hard jobs that you have to figure out how to coach because nobody cares. So you figure out how to coach, stereotypically speaking, in places that nobody even pays attention. Then when you get your chance at a place that's really hard and then you do it despite the volatility of the business, of the administrations, and it never changes who you are, like I just -- I don't even know him, but I just like -- I study coaches, and I just have enormous respect that every time I see him, every time he sees my sons -- Like he sat next to my sons at the Final Four and like they write letters to one another, and my sons have Rutgers gear, and I didn't even know. That's what I told him after the game. Coach, I don't know. I don't know any of these players. I enjoyed studying you the last two days. But it's hard to be a good person in 2024, and I just think he's a really good person, whether he wins or whether he loses. I wish I could be that good of a person."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"I really like a few things. The No. 0 is a lot better analytically than you think. And I think 24 is really skilled, and I think the combination of 21 and 24 allow 2 and 4 to play the way they want to play. I think that 25 and 5 are trying to figure it out, so they figured it out against us. 25 -- yeah, he shot 90 percent and had 20 points. So we helped No. 25. But I just kind of like they're young, and their best players are their youngest players, and every day is a brand new day. I like the things they're doing to put them in spots to be successful. I think 99 is going to have a role, but I think 21 and 24 are going to keep getting a little better and a little better. 0 is undervalued, but Coach doesn't undervalue him, you can tell. And I think when 25 and 5, and now 25 figured it out, I think they have a high ceiling."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"I'm saying this the right way, not with any innuendo, I love Vegas any time of the year. I've only played one time in Vegas in 2013 in December. I played in a neutral site game and lost by six to the University of New Mexico the game before Christmas. So this was my first experience. Some of the people whose names are not on Players Era that are involved is how Texas AM was invited. It's a game changer for us. It was scheduled to be Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, but relative to the exposure, relative to the competition, how it was ran that it's all in one roof. I didn't know all of that was going on in Vegas because all I've done is go to the room and come to the gym, but I think it's probably a great place for fans and all of the things that come with high level basketball. So I have a hard time believing there's many places better."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"Congratulations to Brian and his kids. They deserved to win. Shoot, there was some possession things. Coleman-Jones kid when he banked -- I think they called it a three, it was a two. When he banked that ball in, the defense was outstanding. We just needed to get a stop there. But he banks it in, and then we go down and got a one and one to win it in regulation. Then we still had an opportunity. Was it one and one in regulation or overtime? I can't remember. Which one is that? No, the free throws. Yeah, we had two chances there to win it. Same thing against Alabama. Our chance to win that one, we're up five with four-something to go against Auburn. We're right there. Just sometimes you've got to keep plugging and finding who the guy is. We've always had the guy. This team doesn't have a guy yet. Then as a coach I've got to help them. I'm not a finger pointer, never have been. Got to really, really continue to evaluate this team. They're all in different roles, and we have a hard time getting the ball into the paint for kickouts. We struggle with that. San Diego State did a great job of guarding that tonight. Then we did -- same thing. They had some tough, contested threes, especially No. 21, Byrd, hit three. Then the Jones kid, threes off the bounce. But we're up 10, we're up 11, 40-29. We're up 10."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"I don't think so. We're similar. Maybe certain things are different, but it doesn't have to be alike or different. They're both good."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"I saw the stat sheet. Jones kid was shooting off the bounce threes. He made three of them. That doesn't include the one he banked in. The offense looks a lot better when the ball goes in the basket, that's for sure."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"Talented kids are going to make some shots. We're not the 1964 Dodgers with Sandy Koufax. We're not going to shut them out. They're going to score points. It was Compton and Coleman-Jones they scored 29 points. What were they averaging combined coming into the game? I don't have that. But you know, when you're struggling, that's what happens. We've just got to keep hanging in there. Keep the right attitude, keep coming to practice. Coaches, starting with me, we've got to do a better job putting these kids in better positions. We've got to find a way to get some easy baskets against good defensive teams. The offense is always better against teams that don't guard, but San Diego State is a good defensive team. It bothered us tonight because they forced us to play way too much east and west. Some points you've got to get north. You've got to get downhill. You've got to get north and south. We had our opportunities. Sharp's a pretty good scorer. He got in there a few times, and he just missed. Whereas when they had their opportunities, they scored. Hat's off to Brian and his group. We go back and go back to the drawing board and try to figure out how to make this team better."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"No, you don't ever -- I mean, I thought about it, but I don't think that the way his defense was set up, I wouldn't have fouled. The defense is too good. That's giving us a chance to -- that's not a foul situation anyway. They're up three. The best we could do is high. We're down three, right? Why would he foul if you're up three? That's not -- I wouldn't have fouled us. The way they guarded, they guarded the crap out of us. You're not going to put pen to paper and get a wide open shot against a team. You're just going to switch every screen. So someone is going to put the ball in your best shooter's hands off some kind of action. L.J. got a shot. He hit some. His foot was bothering him a little bit tonight. But we've got some guys on the bench we've got to keep bringing along that can help us once we get through December, January, February. A lot of the season left. Houston's not used to losing like this over the last six or seven, seven or eight years, but it happens. You saw what happened in Maui. It happens. You'd better tighten your belt. You don't point fingers and blame as a coach. You figure out how to help your team. A lot of basketball left, and I expect this team to bounce back."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"Players Era has been an awesome tournament. The games have been tremendous. We want to thank you for inviting us. I think we learned a lot about our team the last few days. Obviously played two ranked teams back to back. Had our chances. I want to thank Rutgers Nation. They traveled. They came here to support these guys. They're a few plays away. Out-rebounded what I think is the best rebounding teams in the country. But you can't defend the free-throw line. Defend without fouling we didn't obviously do that today. Give them credit, a terrific coach. They made big plays down the stretch. Their best players made some real plays for them. But we're going to be good. We're going to be good. I like this team a lot. We've just got to figure out how to finish some things off."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",JEREMIAH WILLIAMS,"No, not really. I think I was just playing in the flow of the game. I just made a couple plays happen thanks to my teammates."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"I think we were just in foul trouble with bodies and stuff, but they're the most physical team I had seen. Early on especially they really got some rebounds. You could show them on tape. We didn't have a long time to prepare. I thought we adjusted. I thought we their physicality at some point in time. The fouls were too much to overcome. Did a lot of great things. Ace's goal, to get 10 rebounds. Got 10 rebounds important for us. And then the way Jeremiah played too. But it was foul trouble the whole time in and out, choppy. Emmanuel in and out Nathan in and out. It wasn't the ideal kind of game, but we knew that's what they do. We learned a lot about a lot of different parts of our team, but we also played teams that we're going to see familiar styles coming up. To do this in a short period of time, these guys logged a lot of minutes. Their bodies are banged up. So it will be good to get home and get some treatment and keep going. Keep going."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"He missed the first two games of the season, so he's five games into his college career. He's seeing every kind of defense. He's seeing every kind of different defender. We really needed him to rebound today, and I'm really proud of him. 10, and I think he had a couple others that he kept us involved in. He really has a chance to be special. I'm proud of him, his development. And he's going to continue to do great things, and we need him to. We need these two guys to do what they did today to have us keep moving forward here."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",ACE BAILEY,"My teammates getting me involved, me getting our teammates involved. Like he said, me just rebounding. We needed to rebound. They're a very good rebounding team, so my goal was just to out-rebound, push the ball out of the court, get my teammates open, and just make plays for others."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",ACE BAILEY,"Not just me, Coach Pike preaching rebounds. I mean, every practice we got rebound drills. We just rebound, so that's just where it comes from, just rebounding and him preaching it every day."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"He was in foul trouble too, and he's been getting better. He can make threes. Let's put him in there, see if he can -- he's very athletic. I thought we need some more athletic bodies. I thought he did a good job for the first go-round. He's got to keep improving, but he kind of gives us a little different -- he's a very good shooter too. So he gives us a space the floor kind of guy, especially the way they play defense. We need everyone. I tell our guys we've got to always be ready because you never know when your day is called."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"You have to have a journey. We have a whole new starting five. This isn't like we're bringing back seven veterans who played a lot of minutes. We're depending on our freshmen to do a lot of things for us. J-Will's been good. I think we learned a lot about ourselves. When we play well, we can play with anybody. You go on the road, it's a whole different ballgame. You've got to play well. You can't defend the free-throw line. You've got to rebound, the physicality and guys going through it the first time as a team. You've got to go through the journey. Journey makes you hardened and makes you tougher. You learn some things about yourself. You try to go back and devour some film, get guys kind of focused on the next obstacle, which isn't going to get any easier."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",NATE OATS,"Something about the game ... hard on all of us here in Vegas, last game and this game. Points off turnovers 17-5, and it's hard to overcome that. We've got to figure out a way to take care of the basketball better. Everybody on the team except for Wrightsell turned the ball over. We had multiple guys. It was 15-8, and the points are 17-5 off turnovers. It's hard to overcome that. I think that's the biggest issue. We still had issues with guarding the post. Didn't shoot it particularly well at stretches tonight. But we've had games like that, and we're going to have to be able to overcome some poor nights and get to the offensive boards. I thought we did a pretty good job on that. We had 15 O-boards, but they had 12 themselves. It's not what we were looking to do out here, but it's a good team. We're going to learn from it. We've got to play better and let ourselves regroup for Carolina on Wednesday."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",NATE OATS,"Yeah, played three really good teams. They all had different styles. We got exposed to different stuff from each of the three teams. I thought the tournament coordinators did a great job. It was great being here at MGM staying in the same place you're playing. So I enjoyed the tournament. Houston is one of the toughest teams in the country and we had a battle with them. Rutgers has really talented guys. We've got to figure out how to guard elite level players a little better. Then Oregon is just a really good overall, well-rounded, sound basketball team that did a great job tonight. We've got to take care of the ball better. So played three really good teams. We learned a lot about ourselves, learned what we've got to fix when we get back to the drawing board and fix some stuff."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",NATE OATS,"He's got a lower leg injury. They're concerned about his Achilles, which obviously wouldn't be good. They're going to evaluate it once we get back to Tuscaloosa, get an MRI, and see what we've got going. Keeping our fingers crossed there."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",NATE OATS,"Yeah, I think this is the Jarin we were looking for this year. It's great that he hung in there and got his confidence going. They made big plays. I thought he was really good for us on defense tonight. Made three threes tonight. Made a couple the game before. He's going to be a big part of what we do this year. Really happy for him. He got it going. We've got to keep building him up. He's supposed to be a freshman this year. If you go back to when Clowney was with us, Clowney had a summer start. I can't remember exactly what he was, 1 of 17, 1 of 19, something like that, to start the year out, and hit four of them before the first media timeout against South Dakota State his freshman year. Similar start to what Clowney had, but he's bounced out of it now, and hopefully this will get him going. He shot it pretty well all over the floor. And he had positive defensive leverage, so I think he's really helping us on the defensive end as well."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",NATE OATS,"Yeah, we're pretty balanced. We had five guys in double figures. We tried to get the ball going. We ended up with 21 assists on a poor shooting night from some of our better shooters, to be honest with you. I thought we did a good job moving the ball. If we hadn't turned the ball over 15 times it would have been good. We like to see it spread around a little bit. We had five guys in double figure. I think there's other guys. Grant, a big guy that probably will be in double figures more often than not. Cliff can obviously be a scorer for us too. Derrion's had big games. Mo has had a big game. We got multiple guys capable of scoring in double figures. To be able to put up 81 points when we didn't particularly shoot it well and still turned the ball over 15 times speaks to the depth that we have. We've got to use our depth and also not turn the ball over."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,"It's a gutsy win, especially when you consider the circumstances. This team's dealt with a lot of adversity the last week, and it's not easy to fix things when they go wrong when you're away from home for three games. You can't get into your routine. You can't get your extra shots up. Then to show up to the game and find out Kalkbrenner is not playing and Pop's really sick. We had to have some guys step up. Jamiya really stepped up in a big way obviously on both ends of the floor. I thought he did a great job on Davis and then offensively made some plays for himself and plays for other people that we felt he's capable of making. Then all those guys off the bench from Jasen to Ty to Isaac to Mason and Shane. Fred hadn't played a lot. He answered the bell with a pretty efficient game. Really proud of them, extremely proud of them, because it would have been easy to show up here early in the morning and find out two of your teammates probably aren't playing and hang your head, and these guys were up for the challenge."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,"It's another example, some guys might be better for Jackson some games might be better for Isaac. I thought Mason gave us some good run. Saw some open shots, saw one finally go down, which we needed to do. But I thought Isaac's physicality today was going to be important on the backboards, and he's just got a little more experience than Jackson. We felt Jasen could be a mismatch at the rim with some of the guys when they went small, and we did a good job executing a couple things to get him the ball down there and he made some big plays."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",JAMIYA NEAL,"For sure. We definitely didn't want to leave Vegas without a win. We wanted to stick with it and not get down on ourselves, not feel bad for ourselves. Everyone goes through adversity. We knew we just had to stick together and try to get one, so that was definitely the plan."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,"I think this team, they've been really fun to coach. I think they're connected. I think guys are trying to figure out their roles. When you have young guys that are trying to figure out their roles, they don't understand that you just have to prepare yourself every day with enthusiasm and emotion and effort, and then if your number's called, chances are you're going to be ready for it. But to see the bench, they go 8 for 12 from the field and we don't win the game, our bench has not played great this year, as good as what I think they could play. So today it was good to see Ty out there zipping it around making a couple plays Shane making some big defensive plays on a back cut late in the game for a basket after not playing the whole game. You talk about it all the time, be ready if your number's called. That doesn't mean your number is going to be called, but I think the confidence that group will get from today that not only was their number called, but we really needed them because of injury and illness to some of their teammates, that they were able to step up and do some really good things."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",JAMIYA NEAL,"Yeah, it did. Obviously me, Isaac, and Mason, talk a lot about we can't see them go in. We all work every day at practice day and there's not a lot of missing going on. It was a struggle to figure out why we couldn't make it. I started off making a couple, then IT came in and made a couple, Mason seen one go in, so it was great."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,"We tried to establish him. We felt like Fred had a strength advantage down there and that we were going to be able to get it to him. Who knows what Notre Dame's plan was going into the game, assuming Kalkbrenner was going to play. Were they going to pack it up and have people in the lane, and when he wasn't, I think they played their more standard defense. I wanted to get Fred some touches to get him going more than anything, but he's got to work on that foul trouble. It's been a problem of his. Besides what he did offensively, and he made a couple of really good plays at the rim defensively as well at critical times. The one on the shot clock violation they were over there looking at. This will be really good for him moving forward."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",JAMIYA NEAL,"Today, just seeing us finally get a win, we can at least hang our hat on that, going back home, resting up, and just using that momentum to get prepared for next week. Obviously we've got a big one next week, and I think this will fuel us to go hard next week and try to get a win."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,"As I said, it takes a lot of maturity to prepare yourself with energy and enthusiasm when you're not sure how much you're going to play. Obviously we've got some veterans that are going to be on the floor, but we didn't know Steven was going to sprain an ankle, we didn't know Kalk was going to be out, we didn't know Pop was going to miss a game or two or come down with the flu. That's why you get ready. What it does from a team standpoint, their teammates have more confidence in them now because of their ability to perform under pressure when they're asked to, and obviously from the coaching staff's perspective, I just had a gut feeling to go with Shane defensively down the stretch. He made some really, really good plays for us, and he's got a physical body."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,"I don't think it's going to be long term. More precaution, I think, at this stage get him home. Pop just got the flu. Based on what I saw before the game, surprised he tried to play. You saw he had to leave a couple times, so he was feeling pretty rough."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",JAMIYA NEAL,"That's something Jackson and I do before the game, we hit the ball and make one together. Do our little one-two. That's me and my guy, the freshman."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,I'd rather he go back and play defense.
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",JAMIYA NEAL,It was a timeout.
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",GREG McDERMOTT,"Actually, I have three because Sterling Knox is from here as well. Went to high school here along with Shane and Pop. We've recruited a lot in Vegas over the years, and we'll continue. There's a lot of good high school coaching here in the city. These guys have come in here and done a great job for us. I'd be remiss too, I know there's a lot of questions about this tournament going in from the national media, some that might be present, but this is incredibly well organized. The way they treated our staff and our team and the organization of the event from the time we arrived until we're going to hit the road here soon has been absolutely incredible. I think you try to put something new together that's unique, and we were really excited to be part of it, and we're excited to be part of it moving forward in the future. I think all the questions were certainly answered. I think they knocked it out of the park with the way this event was run and organized. From my perspective, I've been doing this 36 years, I'd have never, ever guessed this was the first year of an event the way that it was pulled off. Kudos to Intersport and everybody else that put this together. It was great."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"When we scheduled this season, I knew I had a good team, but could we be good in November? It's the last day in November, and we were pretty good. I'm proud of these guys. It was a daunting four-game stretch with the Zags, Creighton, Oregon, and Houston. But we played good basketball, and we did what we had to do. We split. When you split, obviously you get greedy and want more. But we were fortunate enough to get two wins out of this event. It was a hard event. It was a good event. We just stayed focused for longer stretches. We're talented. We're deep. We're connected. We turned maybe a nine rebound deficit at halftime to two for the game. They had 17 offense, we had 14. We had 2 turnovers at halftime, 7 for the game. For a new team that's pretty good too. Houston is a great opponent. We have nothing but respect for Kelvin and his program. We're grateful for the win, and we get to celebrate by opening at Fresno in our conference opener on Wednesday. We've got to celebrate the moment today and then start getting ready for the conference opener when we get back to San Diego."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",MILES BYRD,"Just being solid and continuing to do what we was doing, trying to execute plays, rebound, and it ended up working out in our side. Obviously get stops, that's the biggest thing. Both teams are defensive programs. Now you have a look at what the inside of our practices look like. That's exactly what inside our practices look like when we've been working multiple months in our practices. So I'm glad we were able to come out and get a win."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",PHARAOH COMPTON,"I would say just like staying locked in during the game. The first half might not always go your way, so you've got to be locked in. Like we've got another 20 minutes to play in the second half and then be ready for your turn. They eventually got on the board, but those points matter, and it ended up being the game changer for us."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",MILES BYRD,"I think this is big for us. We lost a lot of guys so a lot of people probably thought we weren't as tough as we've always been, but we're always going to be tough. We're always going to play defense. We're always going to rebound. I'm glad we were able to display it tonight."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",PHARAOH COMPTON,"Yeah, I think we're a hard, tough, fighting team. Just staying through it throughout the whole 40 minutes. You've got to keep playing hard throughout the whole game because the other team, they aren't going to let up. Got to make sure we stay locked in the whole game."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,This is a pretty good young freshman here. He played against as good of bigs as you're going to play over a four-game series. He shows he belongs out there and getting better every game. Nothing but bright sun ahead for this young man on the floor.
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",PHARAOH COMPTON,It was great. The energy is amazing. It was so comfortable being out there on the floor out here on my home court. It felt even better to get the win out there against a really good and great Houston team. Got to get ready for the next game next week.
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"Thanks to the Aztec fans. We travel. That's why we have the record we have in Vegas, because our fans support us. To come back after Tuesday, Wednesday, and then come back for a Saturday game shows the kind of support we have. We're grateful for it."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",PHARAOH COMPTON,"I would say I was more like patient. I was getting ready for it. I was locked in leading up to the game. So you've just got to dial in and lock into the scout for the matchups. That's what I did. I really did own up to this matchup. Houston, they were one of my offers, so I take it personal."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"We called his number tonight. We ran post-up plays for him, which we hadn't run yet this year. A lot of giving him the ball in the low post, and he produced when we put it there, so I'm proud of him."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",PHARAOH COMPTON,"It's all those put together, but most definitely just trusting in my coach and knowing that he's going to put me in the right position. So when I go out there, I've just got to play hard every time I'm in the game, and everything is going to go right. It's going to happen."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",MILES BYRD,"I wouldn't say I was purposely on that side, but we talked about, once we get a shot up, we're going to suicide rebound. That just happens to be where I start on the play, and I was able to read the ball off the rim and get a rebound and knock down two free-throws, which was big."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"The back side of that play Byrd was going to rear screen 'Goon to the rim and step out. So if we didn't have B.J. in the corner we were going to curl Nick up, hit him, and then get him a catch. Either a lob dunk or a catch for Byrd with isolation up top."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"They were going to jump out there and hedge your blitz ball screens, and we were going to short roll and let our bigs make decisions. We made some good ones and we made some not so good ones, but that's what they make you do. You can't roll to the rim or they're going to steal the ball. Just tried to short roll and played out of that. We've been playing a lot more free, just free movement and random ball screens, slip out of ball screens. I think that serves you well in a game like this because it's hard to score on your set plays. It's playing after the play. I think we continued to grow that part of our game."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"I told Jared, you can't be one-dimensional. You're out there. I like you shooting threes, but you've got to go to the glass. You've got to crash from out there. So he has to grow his game. I said, you're multi-talented. You're not just talented. You've got to take advantage of all of your talents. When you do that, you'll become a better player, and we'll become a better team."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"I just told them before the game, whether it was the scrimmage against UCLA or being down to Gonzaga or being down to Oregon, we fought back in all those games. I told them they've got a grit about them and a toughness, and now can we have that toughness for 40 minutes? We had it for 45. That's what it took. We've got to be tough for all the regulation and overtime in order to beat a team like Houston. I thought we had grit and toughness about us for the entire game. We didn't give in."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"It serves San Diego State the most, and then it serves the Mountain West. That's how we're a multi-bid league. We've got to win games like this. Boise beats Clemson, New Mexico beats UCLA, and we have to win these games as a conference. This is where the strength comes."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",DANA ALTMAN,"Absolutely. It's only November, but we played three really good teams, well-coached teams. All gave us different looks. It's only November, but the tournament was well-run. We were treated great. Everything about it was first class -- the hotel, the meals, the officials, the opponents. Couldn't have been treated better. Like I said, it's only November, but it is a great learning tournament."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",DANA ALTMAN,"Well, our bracket was pretty good. I think we won all four games. That was good. San Diego State gave us everything we wanted. So we knew that was going to be a good ballgame. We felt like we could play with Alabama even though they were ranked higher than us and their KenPom and all that was better than ours. We didn't feel like we didn't match up with them. We felt like we matched up okay. They just play a little different style than we do. We're a little bit more inside out. They took 38 threes. I think I'd go nuts if we took 38. But like I said, that gives us different styles. Texas AM tried to beat us up on the boards. San Diego State's perimeter defense really got out, pressured us. And then this team just gives you different looks offensively that we're not used to."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",KEESHAWN BARTHELEMY,"Honestly I just felt like my teammates trusted me, and I just tried to help in the game. I think I was able to get going with some steals. I had a couple. Just the two-way game is the best game to be played, and my teammates trusted me down the stretch offensively, and I was able to come up big for them."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 30, 2024",KEESHAWN BARTHELEMY,"We definitely have to work on our press offense. We'll definitely work on that on Monday. The important thing is we came out with a win. Wins are very tough to come by any time of the year, especially against ranked opponents. We've got a lot of work to do, but we can celebrate for a day and then go back to work on Monday."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"Creighton, they just put so much stress on you offensively. A lot of it has to do with your decision on how you're going to guard 11. I think they're a completely different team with 1. And analytically they're fast. And you watch them and you think fast means in the full court. They're just really fast in the half court. And 2, 1, 5 is a one-man fast break. 11 is a First-Team All-American in many respects. And then 23's been playing really well. So, I do think down the stretch we had really good offensive possessions. And then in the middle of the half I thought we were fouling too much. And then I thought we stopped fouling and were able to get consecutive stops and then make good decisions on the other end."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BUZZ WILLIAMS,"So we didn't explain too much to the guys because we didn't know the health of 1. And so we just probably kind of balanced the two -- like, are we going to play the team that played last night or are we going to play the team with 1. I thought our guys handled all of that the right way. I think their play catalog is a little different when 1's playing, rightfully so. I think 2 is probably more comfortable off the ball. He made big shot after big shot tonight. It's hard to win when a team scores 24 more points than you from 3. So you have to play with a low turnover rate to have a chance. I thought we did a really good job on the offensive glass to be able to shoot more balls than they did. But I don't think you can guard 11 at the rim one-on-one. So, so much of what Coach McDermott does, I think he's a savant offensively and probably doesn't get the credit he deserves, but he's constantly manipulating the low man on your second defender guarding 11. So I know statistically this year they haven't shot it from 3 at the same level as they have in the past. But when they had 1, that's different than the back end of Nebraska and yesterday's game."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",WADE TAYLOR IV,"Coach always talked to us all year about being grimy because we're at our best when we're grimy. It's a tug-of-war match. So for us to come out there and compete as hard as we did because Creighton is an amazing team, shout-out to them, just shows how much we believe in each other and how much we want to make sure when it get tight that we continue to make sure we pull it out."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",HENRY COLEMAN III,"An unbelievable player. Probably one of the best bigs in the country. Amazing shot blocker, finishes really well around the rim. For us, we just wanted to have crazy ball pressure. I thought the guards were unbelievable at that tonight. And just being physical with him. He's an unbelievable player. But when we were physical with him, I think it kind of gave them problems. I think just being physical, having great ball pressure really helped us a ton tonight."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",WADE TAYLOR IV,"Yeah, we definitely have talked about it because of course me and him has been through all of it -- the eight-game losing streak, the five-game losing streaks. We just try to make sure we can avoid that as much as we possibly can. Typically normally we get comfortable and we kind of don't have that same edge at the beginning as we do in the end, we kind of get complacent. But we just try to make sure that we keep that edge throughout the whole year because that's who we are. And I think that we keep that the whole year then at the end of the year may have a different outcome than it has been since we've been here."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",WADE TAYLOR IV,"It starts with how we practice. We have two refs in practice that are, don't tell them I said this, but are unbelievably terrible. One is a grad assistant and one is an assistant coach. And they don't call anything. We just go about it every day being physical because that's who we want to be we want to be the most physical team. Once teams continue to be physical with us, we kind of gravitate to it. That just makes us play harder. I think that starts with how hard we play in practice because how you play is how you practice."

2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",HENRY COLEMAN III,"I think NIL is awesome. I think we're super fortunate. I think how it's been run has been unbelievable. I just think when you're able to pay players and when you're able to use the NIL for a good reason and have people come out here and crazy competition, Hall of Fame coaches, All-American players, this is the best place to be right now. I know there's Maui and stuff going on, but I think right here is the best place to be. We're fortunate and blessed to be here."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",HENRY COLEMAN III,"Just how it's run, the competition right now. You have Hall of Fame coaches in the building right now. You have all of American players. Wade's one of them. And many on the other team. I think the competition -- we talked about it amongst the team. If there was no money involved we'd still play in this tournament just because we love the competition and love playing the best and the best. Just to have it in one sitting is a blessing."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",WADE TAYLOR IV,"I was definitely excited to come back to Vegas. I came my freshman year for the Maui tournament. Vegas AAU, it's amazing. To come to Vegas as a collegiate player is great. I'm excited we were able to participate in the tournament, just being in Vegas because Vegas is always a good time."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",MICAH SHREWSBERRY,"Credit to Houston. Just a great coach. Really good team. Really hard team to play on second night of back-to-back. We had a bunch of dudes playing 40, 45 minutes the night before. I thought we did really good things defensively. I thought we moved the ball pretty well for maybe 30 minutes of the game, but I felt like we wore down at the end, and they have a lot to do with that, with how they play and how much pressure they put on you on both ends of the court. But proud of our guys for their effort. And we'll grow from this. This game is going to help us way down the line this season."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",MICAH SHREWSBERRY,"Just played the best team in the country toe to toe for whatever. Almost 40 minutes and we're showing it right now. Like, it's not changing. So like we need to continue to have belief. We need to continue to find different ways to win, whether that's a high-scoring affair like last night or whether it's a knock-down-drag-out game like tonight. I think we can kind of do both and find different ways to have success and find different ways to try and win."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",MICAH SHREWSBERRY,"I felt our effort, in the first half, they hit four 3s, and I felt like three of them weren't mistakes on our part, which kind of opened up the game a little bit going into halftime. But we wanted to protect the paint. We wanted to try to keep them away from the rim. We wanted to keep them off the foul line and then be there on their guys that make shots. I thought Logan Imes did an incredible great job on L.J. Cryer, making him take tough shot after tough shot. You look at Sharp, goes 3 of 9 from 3, and one of them is a bank shot. We did a good job of holding our own, and then holding our own on the glass, eight offensive rebounds."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"Back to back playing these kind of teams, give Alabama a ton of credit, they're really deep and they're really good. I thought we came back after a tough game last night and played our tails off. Gotta keep getting better. But a high, high level game. I think Alabama is as good a team as there is in the country. Definitely as deep a team as I've ever played against. We just come up a couple of plays short. Big rebounds on free throw misses down the stretch but probably needed him to stay out of foul trouble, and obviously he would have been in the game at the end too. And Dylan and Ace played really, really well. But give Alabama credit. That's a really good basketball team. I don't know if there's many teams as loaded as they are."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN HARPER,"Taking what the defense gives me. Obviously Alabama is a great team, very trusting staff. My teammates know, put the ball in my hands and gave me the confidence to go out there and make the right play, and I feel like I did that today."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN HARPER,"I mean, it's obviously an honor just because being in that elite category, but for me the biggest thing for me for us is winning. I feel like we were just a couple of plays short today. It was obviously a great honor. I'm happy to be in that little list, but the biggest thing today was winning."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",JEREMIAH WILLIAMS,"I mean, ever since day one they stepped on campus they've shown extreme maturity, and they're going to keep getting better day by day, and these are games they'll take under their belt and learn from. They're two very talented young players. It's amazing to see."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN HARPER,"It was just friendly trash talk. I've known him all my life, really, since seventh, eighth grade, just growing up just being friends with him. It was just a little friendly trash talk. That's all it was to it."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN HARPER,"It was like we're playing basketball at the end of the day, both me and him are very competitive. We both can go out compete with each other even if we're on different sides of the ball."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"I think we were there today too Nate Oats is an elite coach, Final Four team last year. Toe to toe -- and we're young. We've got a whole new group of starters. Having Jeremiah in foul trouble, too, he does a lot for our team. He's one of our best defenders, too. But they're really good, give them a lot of credit. But we put 90 points up on the board, and we've got to do a better job on the defensive end, obviously, but I think this team is growing. We're learning a lot. We've got a lot of new pieces. Better days ahead for us, I think."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"Credit to Alabama. They outrebounding Houston the other night. And Houston is the standard for rebounding in the country. So we're getting better at it. We're getting better. Our shot selection helps. Sometimes our rebounding, too. But gotta take good shots. If we take good shots we can rebound it. Obviously we've got weaknesses on our team, just like every team in the country is trying to figure out. But guys are focused on it and we've just got to do better job as a team, collective rebounds."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"Emmanuel is getting better and better. He's getting better and better. When he figures it out it will be very interesting. He's coming. He's a worker. He's a really good teammate. They have an elite bunch of big guys, not just Cliff. They just keep bringing them in. They just keep bringing them in. Again, I think they have the best bench in the country. They're bringing guys off the bench that, credit to him, these guys are probably starters at a lot of places. And so we have to battle a lot of guys. They've got great size. So it's always a tough game."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"It's funny somebody said that to me the other day. He was pretty good in those days. He's a freshman, does unbelievable things. He's learning. He was locked in and confident and he's a good player. It's part of his journey. And guys guard him differently every game is different when you're a rookie. Tapes get out, people do different things. He's got to figure that out, too. But he's a fantastic kid and a worker. Had a great game today -- they had multiple defenders all kinds of sizes. We saw a little bit of everything tonight. So it will help him out moving forward."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"I think it's like anything, the journey. You grow through your seasons and you grow through the games. This is as talented a team too as we're probably going to face, definitely as deep a team. We did some good things, but we'll carve out the tape and learn more. We've got to get better. You've got to finish these kind of games off. You don't get many of these opportunities to play top three or four teams in the country. But it's part of our journey this year with a whole new group of guys. And Jeremiah only played a little bit last year and Emmanuel and J-Mike and the rest of us are all new to the season. These obstacles you have to live through."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVE PIKIELL,"Try to get good shots for good players. Analytics tells you all these things but the game dictates what you have, and you want guys to take really good shots. When you eliminate all the mid-range, there's not a lot of court left, really. So take what's available. These guys can really do a good job of rising up. They've got great size. Jeremiah is one of the best mid-range guys, too, in the country. Try to take what's available, and I think that's important for us. Continue moving forward and keep our defense up. But when those guys get those shots, Ace is really hard to guard in those 15-foot range, and Dylan can go downhill and do a lot of different things. We have to take advantage of the things they bring to the table, and we'll do that."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN HARPER,"I think we showed we can compete against anyone in the country. All 12 guys, all stepped up front and went out and went to go get it. Obviously we fell short, but I feel as a team, sometimes we've got to feel better falling short to just having the season we want to have."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",JEREMIAH WILLIAMS,"Just what he said. We showed we're a competitive team. It's just a small little bump in the road and something you can learn from, and I think we'll just continue to get better as the season goes."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NATE OATS,"That's a good team. We played our best. You've got to give them a lot of credit. They came out ready to play. I'm not so sure we did. It became a game. Dylan Harper is really talented. And Ace Bailey, super talented. First half didn't have an answer for them. These two guys next to me were the two best defenders for Ace for sure with the size on him. We got in foul trouble. Jarin had two early. Derrion got in foul trouble. We didn't have good answers for him. And we had no answer at all for Dylan Harper the entire game. We've got to figure our defense out. We're not where we need to be defensively. Really disappointed in it, but they're talented too. Those guys are going to cause some problems with other teams. But we've got to do a better job. Our turnovers were a major issue. They scored 23 points off our 20 turnovers. That's way too many for having a skilled, talented team that's supposed to be a good offensive team. We didn't take care of the ball well tonight. Give the team a lot of credit for physicality. They got into us. They caused turnovers. They're a well coached team. They're physical. They know what they're doing. We were in a dogfight. And we were fortunate that we got enough stops late. And we went to the offensive glass hard enough. We doubled them up on second-chance points 18-9. That's where we won the game. And Mo Dioubate ends up with five O boards and our team ends up with 16. Nobody else had more than two. It was Mo and then it was counted by group effort there. Kind of the second game in a row where we won on toughness and rebounding. We'll get our offense figured out. We're indiscernible going to stop turning the ball over 20 times. We'll get our defense figured out. And hopefully we'll keep the rebounding up at the level it's been the last two games."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NATE OATS,"We've had a couple ourselves, and these guys are up there. I mean, Ace, maybe the best mid-range shot-maker I've seen. He just kind of rises up over guys, the floaters with the touch. You know, he's tough. We didn't do a great job. We needed more size on him. I thought Derrion did a pretty good job on him. He's a guy that if you don't have size on him he's shooting over 6'2"", 6'3"", 6'4"" guards. He's going to cause some problems. We thought that going in. And Derrion has got to stay out of foul trouble because he's turning into an elite defender for us. And then Dylan, he gets to the rim pretty much whenever he wants. We didn't have anybody that can stay in front of him. And ball screens, we didn't do a very good job. He's got some force, some physicality, some strength coming downhill. So if you are in your drop, he comes downhill with some force and puts pressure on it at the rim. They didn't take very many the 3s. I think Ace was 1-for-3 and Dylan 0-for-3. They didn't take a lot, but Dylan got to the rim whenever he wanted. And he also got to the free-throw line and creates contact with his size. And he makes them. Shoot, elite-level scorers make their free throws. He's 15-of-16 at the line. Those two are really good they'll both be high draft picks I'm sure. You know, I thought Dylan really commanded the game in the second half and really kept them in there most of the second half."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DERRION REID,"I feel like with our team, it's next man up mentality. Whether you're starting, it doesn't matter. Just be ready for when you're called up, when it's your time to step up and guard the player whoever's in front of you."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",JARIN STEVENSON,"I just feel like they was bringing energy on the bench. And the starters also just help and instill confidence in our bench. Just coming out for the game they talked us up and just hyped us up. Just feel like, yeah, as a team we're just good at that."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NATE OATS,"One, we've got to take care of the ball. It's hard to score when you turn it over. So turnovers is the biggest issue. Second thing is when we're not playing fast and teams turn us into a half court team we've got to be able to execute some things, set screens, learn how to create advantages. Sometimes we spend a lot of time on teaching our guys conceptual basketball, how to play the flow, how to attack different coverages in the flow. We've got to do a better job working on our execution, some dead balls or if we feel like we're in drought we need to be able to call sets. We haven't done a job executing stuff that we've run. So, it's like some of our guys that are tough guys that are impacting winning in a lot of other ways aren't necessarily great execution guys. Some are better execution guys. And to get better on defense, rebounding, impacting the game that way. So right now you know we've got to do better on both. We've got to get the tough, blue-collar guys better at executing some stuff and getting some of our shooters open. And then we gotta get some of the other guys that are our scorers a little bit more blue-collar and impacting winning in other ways other than scoring so that we can maybe indiscernible a little bit more than we are now."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DERRION REID,"Yes, I feel like we learn more every game. Just we're seeing different coverages, different ways they guard us. We learn more stuff on offense on how we can get better every game. And he stacked our schedule for a reason. He had trust in us. So we just gotta accept the call."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",JARIN STEVENSON,"Yeah, earlier in the season I feel like our team wasn't doing the best in the under-12, when there's 12 minutes left in the game. I feel like we've been better, we've been learning from that. Those tougher opponents early on in the season help teach us to be strong and mentally tough and continue fighting throughout the entire game."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NATE OATS,"He's kind of what we try to embody in the blue-collar mentality we preach. We obviously play indiscernible, score a lot of points. But to try to build the base of what we do around blue-collar mentality. And he's been the best at it. And we grade out blue-collar points for indiscernible. He's won the hard hat the last two games, a ridiculous amount to be honest with you. He's making bets with his teammates as to whether he's going to win it. Most of them would be smart not to bet him anymore because he's going to win it about every night. He hits the offensive board, he gets offensive board from the free-throw line. He gets them everywhere. He's finishing at the rim. Shooting 6-for-6 at the free-throw line. I tell the guys when you're locked in, you're locked in. I think he's locked in to making winning plays."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NATE OATS,"I would sure hope so. He's big, strong, tough. He's got the right mindset. He's all about winning."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NATE OATS,"I don't have a good answer on that one because, honestly, you drop, he comes down with some fours. You blitz him, I've seen other teams blitz him, and he actually makes all the right reads. He's a willing passer. He's an NBA point guard. Probably the best way, to be honest with you, is switch him. And you have to have five guys in there that can actually guard him, because if you've got somebody that can't guard him, they're just going to run the switch. So we had Sears with four fouls. Sears is a big deal. Our team, he goes out, I think they went on a 10-3 run, two and a half minutes. When he went out of the game, had to get him back in. As soon as he goes in, we go on a 7-0 run, try to hunt him on ball screens. Honestly, the best way is probably to switch him. But you have to have five guys in that can guard him in there that can switch him so I don't know how many college programs have five guys that can guard him that way."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NATE OATS,"The way they played tonight, they were one of the better teams in the country. They have two of the most talented players regardless of class, when you're talking about two talented freshmen -- freshmansenior, doesn't matter. They have other guys that understand their role. They put some pressure on our defense. Our defense wasn't very good tonight. Based on what I saw tonight, they should be pretty good. So I told our guys we're going to see a lot different team than what showed up at Kennesaw. They're young. I don't want to speak for them so I don't know what the deal was going into that game, but sometimes some younger kids have experienced playing, they need to understand that there's a lot of really good college basketball players at all levels. I've told our team, we're going to see a much better team than that. And we did. This is a team that easily could have beat us tonight if a few things didn't go our way. We needed it too late. I see them competing in the Big Ten. I think they're going to win some big games. I think the more experience those young guys can get early, the more tournament, sophomores, because they played so many minutes, the better off they're going to be here shortly. A lot of respect for them. They do a good job. They played us tough. They put a lot of pressure on us. We have a lot to learn after that game. They exposed some stuff we've got to get better at."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",GREG MCDERMOTT,"It was a really good game against two good teams, a very physical game. I thought our inability to keep them off the foul line the first half, I thought we could have had some separation had we not fouled. Now, having said that, they're hard to guard without fouling. I mean, they're so physical in what they do. We knew offensive rebounds were going to be a big part of the game. We were able to hang in there the first half but not the second half. They really flipped the script on us the second half from an offensive rebounding standpoint."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVEN ASHWORTH,"It felt good. There was obviously some things that I felt like I couldn't quite do, but coming off an ankle sprain as severe as I've had, just grateful to God for all the prayers and grateful to Bluejay nation. It's cool to be part of a university that has a lot of faith. I have a strong faith, and I definitely know without God and obviously all the help with all the trainers and the amount of work we've been working on I wouldn't be able to play today. I was just glad to be back out there with my teammates."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",GREG MCDERMOTT,"They did a good job -- without looking at the film I can't say for sure. There was a lot of physicality there on stopping some of our cuts. But they blew it up. And unfortunately we didn't have a timeout left. But until I watch it on film, I don't know."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",GREG MCDERMOTT,There were a few times where Kalk rotated to help and didn't get the block. And then we got caught with a bad match-up on the backside. And then there were a few times we didn't do what we were supposed to do with the physicality. I've got some freshmen out there against some pretty physical guys that have played a lot of college basketball and we lost that match-up a few times. But I like the fact we didn't quit. We played through it and we had some golden opportunities throughout the game. And for the most part we executed some stuff late until that side out-of-bounds play.
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",GREG MCDERMOTT,"Yeah, I think his ceiling is ridiculously high. He hasn't even scratched the surface yet. And he goes and gets 14 rebounds yesterday against San Diego State. And today, whatever -- what was he, 1-for-7, and then hits back-to-back 3s at a critical point in the game. That's just a young man who trusts his work, that's put in the amount of repetition that you have to be to be a great shooter. And his teammates, Jamiya made a great extra pass to him on that extra possession to give us the one-point lead. And unfortunately we weren't able to get a stop when we needed to. We led the game for 35 minutes. We just couldn't finish the darn thing."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",GREG MCDERMOTT,"You can't it's not nine out of nine it has be 10 out of 10 where everybody is connected, is hooked up and everybody understands what their responsibilities are. And it's one thing to understand it's another thing that you have to execute them when the lights are the brightest. We were definitely a better team today than we were yesterday. We had some guys log some pretty big minutes. And obviously he's not fully healthy, but I thought he gave a really gutsy effort."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",STEVEN ASHWORTH,"Obviously our offense is different with the different rotations we can throw in. I think a big element I'm bringing to the floor is just the spacing and the gravity when I'm coming off screens or ball screens or off ball screens, I feel like there's some awareness there that also then opens up things for other guys. Being my second year on the offense, understanding the pace and tempo we want to play with, and I think yesterday we were a little slow with our tempo at times and I felt like I was able to bring some of that back today. But I was just really grateful to be able to be back and my teammates have been encouraging me all week and coach encouraging me, was talking to me throughout the game how it all felt. Jeremy and Ben were doing a great job monitoring that as well. It was good."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",GREG MCDERMOTT,"Same thing I've told my teams for 36 years, teams who point fingers lose. And we're not going to do that."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"It's all part of the process. Sometimes that's hard to accept as a player or a coach. But Oregon did to us what they did to Texas AM. They went on a good run. I think the score was 27-27 with 321 left to go in the first half. And they scored 41 points the last bit of that half. And it all started with a rebound, which was the difference in the first half. I think they got 57 percent of their misses. And they kicked out, got a lot of 3s. So the rebounding was the real Achilles' heel for us the first half. Second half, we battled back. I've got a good group of kids. And they're getting better. And we battled back and got close enough, but didn't get over the hump. So all these experiences are giving us a chance to grow as a team. And that's what we're going to look at it as, a chance to grow to start stacking games, like I've said. And this is another one, and we'll learn from it, and hopefully get better because we'll have to be because there's another good team waiting for us on Saturday. And we'll find out who that is later tonight. But Oregon is a good team, obviously. They're undefeated. They've done this to everybody. They did it to us when they got ahead early. They've been down in a lot of games this year and then spurted to get ahead. They spurted on us at the end of the half in a close game and got ahead. We tried to battle back into it, but couldn't get all the way."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"That was one of the keys of the game. We're growing as a rebounding team. Magoon has length but he lacks some strength. I thought Jared did a good job early in the game rebounding. He was on a lot of those early but then got in foul trouble and sat the end of the first half. And then we've got a freshman, a redshirt, a true freshman and a sophomore out there trying to rebound against really good players. We have to get bigger and stronger and have a nose for the ball. And my guards rebound. Nick two games ago had nine, and BJ last game had eight. The guards have to continue to come in and try to help us out where we're not giving up all those second chance opportunities."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NICK BOYD,"Like you said, a lot of great bigs but I think we showed that we can compete. It's all about us. I think today, starting with myself as a leader for the team, didn't really come out here and handle business the correct way. If you look back on the game, all the ways we lost today is self-inflicted. It's just about focus, maturity and, like Coach said, just keep growing. But you come to a tournament like this, there's no room for error."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NICK BOYD,"I think it's a great advantage. We get a chance to go home, sleep in our own beds, really settle down, get our minds right, and come back to it tomorrow, I believe, and practice real hard in our own gym, our own locker room, and get back on a flight, motivated, ready to go and win another big game."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"You know, we try to keep them out of the paint and help and front the post and do some things. We pulled our defense in. And I thought we did a good job fighting in the paint. They get downhill on a lot of people. But we didn't close out then and they made a lot of good 3s. They can shoot the ball and obviously they've got some really good shooters. Bamba is one that, once he gets going, everything starts going in. I think he had five today. And we're playing him for the drive and he proved that he's more than capable of also shooting the 3, which we knew he could but you kind of pick your poison."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"I think we can't lose sight of the bigs we're playing against, too. We're playing elite bigs right now. So I like my bigs. I think they're more than capable. Obviously Pharaoh and Taj and I have a couple real good combinations for indiscernible there. Magoon rolled him and fouled him late. We walk the line between rolling and popping because they can shoot some too. When it's time to roll, they have to roll in there, catch the ball and finish around the rim. We were productive, but obviously not as productive as some of the guys we went against."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",NICK BOYD,"I mean, definitely, after that Gonzaga game, that was the first time this group was in the fire at a high level. So you want to come out of games like that learning lessons. And I feel like we got over that hump. But as you see today, just another time where we get back, we get back, we give them a little bit of an edge and we can't get over the hump as a group. We've got to dial in, keep practicing hard, and when we get over that hump, it's going to be go time."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BRIAN DUTCHER,"Yeah, BJ is a dynamic player. He was when we recruited him out of high school. He continues to grow his game. He made some real difficult shots. There were a couple times he got into traffic and tried to move it out. So BJ is growing his game, too. He's played a minute or so a game last year. So he's getting major minutes. Every time he's on the floor, he learns and grows. That's this team. This team is in the growing process, and it's all of us. It's not just the players. It's me. I'm learning how to coach this group, how to put ourselves in the best position to be successful and what combinations need to be out there at what times. It's always a process. It's always better when you can win and learn, and we took an L against a good team and we have to grow from that, too."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"Having the right guys on the floor, getting in our stance, not making any mistakes. That was the key. I thought we did a great job guarding last night. Came within -- probably we're an inch away from winning the game. We got the ball. We led by four the last four minutes. We were up four most of the last four minutes. Sears hit a tough 3 with a hand in his face. Went 1-for-2 from the free-throw line. That was the difference in the game. Even then, we still had the ball and the chance of winning it at the end. So the difference in Alabama and Houston is minuscule. Not much difference in the two teams. I knew that tonight was going to be a tougher game than last night because -- I would say Nate would probably say the same thing -- because of how much we both invested in that game. These kids aren't robots. Having to bounce back and play a game like that tonight, and Terrance carried us the first half. The second half, always tricky with his Achilles. He's not to the point where he can sit down for 15 minutes and come back out and do what he did. But I thought J'Wan Roberts, he's a special kid, a special player, probably not going to be on anybody's draft list, like really good college players -- played 121 games in his career, that tells you all you need to know about him. He's a winner. He'd be the first to tell you he hasn't played great thus far. But I trust him and when we need him. Notre Dame is a team to defend. And L.J. didn't have his legs tonight, was 2-for-11. Emanuel -- we had so many good looks, we just didn't make them. But Notre Dame, good guard, extremely well coached. They've got really good guards that can really shoot. And Micah found something with No. 7, what's his name, the Davis kid, he found something with him. Like a good coach, he kept going at it. And we did great job defending him the second half, got on his right hand, and we were right there to help. But our defense won the game. Good teams win games on nights when the ball won't go in. We had a lot of opportunities tonight, but we're getting them. Credit to Notre Dame. They had a tough game last night, too. They lost their point guard. That should be mentioned. He was their best player. They played without him. Their kids played their hearts out. I'm not going to be one of them dudes that sit up here and act like we just conquered the world. My hat's off to Notre Dame and their staff and their team for fighting like they did tonight. It's not easy losing a kid of that stature. I think he's preseason all-ACC is that right? He's a good player. Hats off to Notre Dame. Hopefully they'll get that kid back. With him, they're good."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"Terrance would be the first to tell you this, success in games is a product of learning how to practice. Our practice was Rosetta Stone for that kid. He had no idea what -- he was so far ready from being ready to compete. This is a message to parents, don't ever think that a high school all-star equals college success right away. It just doesn't. We're not playing against those high school teams. Not Carmel, Ecclesiastes, Tech. Some of the names of these schools we don't play them. We play Alabama and Kansas and Iowa State. He's never played against that. And the level of that versus high school where he's had great success, you think, well, he's going to be an impact player as a freshman. He's going to impact a lot as a freshman but he's going to get impacted way more."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"I think both of us playing to -- they got out of here at midnight last night. I think last night impacted both of us. It impacted their legs and our legs. Don't ever look at the second or third game and compare it to a game and then five days later you've got another game. You're playing as hard as these teams are playing. We get Alabama tonight. Two games in two days against this caliber, some teams that aren't very good, won't look good on the second night no matter what, but this was a good team. We're a good team. Rutgers is a good team. Alabama is a good team. Something's got to give. And for us, tonight, it was making shots. We didn't have problem with shot selection. We just didn't make them. But Notre Dame deserves a lot of credit for competing. They really competed tonight."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",KELVIN SAMPSON,"We have practice time, so you have to build the day around the time that they have allotted for you. We don't do any pre-prep for the next game. Our kids were ready to beat Alabama. We were in position to do that going into the last 10 seconds. But the first time we looked at Notre Dame -- I didn't even look at them last night. I was so upset we lost. I was more focused on us. But we watched Notre Dame. I actually watched them play Rutgers a little bit when I got back to my room. So I knew Shrewsberry, and I think that's the first time I've ever coached against Notre Dame. But I knew Micah, and I know his background with Brad and all that stuff. But Shrewsberry and Davis, Njie, Allocco, they're tough kids, they're well-coached. We had to go through a lot of stuff today. A lot of teams, you just go over their out-of-bounds plays and it's a wrap. You don't do a whole lot. But this team forced you to really prepare. I don't know what they shot the last 10 minutes, but we sat down, and our stance and our communication, it was on point. I don't know how many points they had with 10 minutes left in the half, but our defense was the story of that game. Not their offense. We couldn't make shots -- and our defense..."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",TERRANCE ARCENEAUX,"I feel good the first half coming into the game. I was just ready to play. But the second half, like Coach said, it's still kind of difficult for me to get back to that level after sitting that long and trying to get back that fast. But still a learning process for me and I'm still getting better with it. Today I feel like I could finish the game. I just got out whenever I felt I was getting tired, and they put me in when I was ready."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",J'WAN ROBERTS,"I mean, I won't take all the credit for being the winningest player. I've been on a lot of good teams especially between 2019 to now. So being with a lot of group of guys that play hard and I learned from them and surrender to the culture. I give all the credit to them and the coaches for developing me while I was here. I just feel like them last two minutes, just having the urge to win the game. We've been in big games before where we had leads late, and it's mental breakdowns caused us to lose the game. Coming down the stretch against Notre Dame, being up five, six points, knowing that free throws can extend the lead and just being locked in, knowing like every position counts. Just trying to be ready for whatever action they throw at us, especially at crunch time, and just being able to end this game moving forward. Because we let two games go away just at the end. So just trying to learn from that and going into games being prepared to finish them."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DANA ALTMAN,"Well, I do like the way that they are competing. Got down yesterday and I thought they fought their tails off to get back. I really liked the plus-17 on the boards today. Other than some turnovers and some loose balls that we had, I thought our guys played really hard and pretty unselfish. So I like the direction we're going. And we've got a lot of depth. We've got some young guys that can fill in and give us some more minutes. So it's only November, but I like the direction we're headed."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DANA ALTMAN,"Well, we looked at their numbers. They were just a plus-one for the season. And after getting our tails kicked yesterday on the boards, we were minus-six yesterday, but the second-chance points, AM kind of put it on us. We just felt that we could make that move today. We did a better job in the second half rebounding the ball against AM. And we just thought the physicality of that game kind of prepared us for this one. So that was all I talked about pregame was just beat them on the boards. I think we can get them on the boards. Their activity defensively -- we're going to turn the ball over a few times. We've just got to get back, put our defense together when we do. But we've got to beat them on the boards. And second-chance points, 18-4. It was 18-0 at the half. So indiscernible second half. Our conditioning must not be very good, but it was 18-0 in the half. That was the 10-point difference we had in the game."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DANA ALTMAN,"I thought TJ, when he takes that ball to the basket it changes his game. The same thing with Brandon. When you're going at the basket, you just get a more aggressive mentality. We lost audio stand on the perimeter too much. And we've got to take it -- I thought we were real selective with our 3s. 10-for-22 is by far the best we've shot it this year. First of all we had the right guys shooting it. But, second, I thought our patience was pretty good."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DANA ALTMAN,"Well, they made a great first impression. They have treated us really well. We fly in, check in the hotel, everything's laid out. Everything's organized. Our meals have been great. We had three top-level officials today. I mean, those are the things as a coach you look for in an event. You want your guys -- how do I say it, to be treated great. You want it to be a good experience for them. I get to go to these tournaments every year, but they get three or four opportunities. And so you want them to enjoy it. You want their families to enjoy it. And the MGM's been great. I've always liked this facility. I said that yesterday. We played the Pac-12 Tournament here four, five years. And we always had really good success. I think it's just a really good basketball arena. It's close. I think it's really set up good for basketball. So, again, my first impression, it's been a very well run event. People have been outstanding to us. And so we're excited about it. I'm happy for the players. We were able to bump everybody in their NIL. I mean, it is what it is, you know where we're at today with that. You cover basketball all the time, you know, that's just where it's at. Guys want to come to your school. I want them to come to Oregon, first of all. I don't want them to come because we're paying them. I want them to be at Oregon, but once they get there, I like to take care of guys. And so it enabled us to bump everybody when we finally got into this tournament. And so those are all positives. And I don't know what the future is of NIL and revenue sharing or distribution, whatever we're going to do here, but for this year it's a good thing for our players. It's been a great tournament."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BRANDON ANGEL,"Basketball, at the end of the day, is a game of runs. And they were on their run. We just knew we had to keep plugging away, playing the basketball that got us to that point in the game. You saw it on the defense end. That's where everything started today, when we were sitting down, playing tough on defense, that allowed us to get out in transition. But also it cuts the momentum of the crowd out. If the other team is not scoring, it's hard for the fans to get involved. Shot like that, yeah, it's nice to stabilize the game, but we got into the media timeout, we said we've got to figure it out on the defensive end of the court."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",BRANDON ANGEL,"My whole process throughout the portal was I want to find a school that's the best fit for me and wins at the highest level. And San Diego is absolutely a program that wins. My whole childhood they won a lot. But at the end of the day I just believed Oregon was the best situation, the best fit for me. And I believed in the staff, the pieces we had. Oregon was the best fit for me and my family."
2024 - PLAYERS ERA POWER COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT,"November 27, 2024",DANA ALTMAN,"They kicked our tail at Stanford for a couple of years. I always respected his game, just his efficiency numbers, his IQ of the game. Today he's 5-for-11, I think it's the most shots he's taken all year. But like yesterday, everything, 4-of-5, 2-of-3, 4-for-4 from the line. He talks defensively. I've got to get him on the boards a little bit more. But he got six today. So the other thing is when he makes a mistake, there's a maturity factor there. He nods his head and goes, yeah. As a coach, it sinks in when they do that. But he's been great. Like I said, I respected his game at Stanford. I was just scared when I saw his transcript and saw all As but one B plus, I'm like, I'm not smart enough to coach this guy. So that was the only thing that scared me in the whole process."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Well, sitting beside me is 39 points, 19 rebounds, 12 assists and only two turnovers. I'd say we got pretty dominant play from our bigs. You know, it's kind of an interesting story. Dylan has had the challenge of playing behind the last couple years Walker Kessler and Johni Broome. You just wouldn't believe how eloquently he did that."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"And they wanted to play together so badly. So I kept on in practice going, look, this is fine, we've got time, but here's the plusminus. We have to play faster. We have to play quicker. Anyways, I'm just happy for these guys because these guys are loving playing together. They were never on the floor together very much in the last couple years, so it's just incredible. They've got great chemistry. They trust each other. They listen to each other. As well, I believe, we've got the best front line in college basketball."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"First off, all glory to God. I thank my teammates, thanks to my coaches. Without them, I wouldn't have had this trophy. The Auburn family traveling, I don't think we would have won the tournament without them. It felt like home. I'm proud of my teammates and my Auburn family."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN CARDWELL,"First things first, all glory to my God, Jesus Christ, my Lord and savior. I want to give a big shout out to my boy Johni. Before the game started when we were in film this morning, he said, they're going to double-team big, big cross or whatever, and he just told me to go to the rim, go to the backside and you're going to be open every time, and he just said trust me with the lob, and I trusted him. It was great playing with Johni. It's a blessing to have him on my team, and it's a blessing to have him as my brother."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"Well, first of all, I came to Auburn because I saw what Coach Pearl was doing with the program. I saw Jabari, Walker, Chuma, JT, Issac. I saw what he had done with those guys and I wanted to come to a foundation that was already felt. That's why I came to Auburn. Coach trusted me and I trusted him. I mean, the Player of the Year don't really matter to me. I care about winning. As long as we keep winning, that set of eyes are on you, so I just look forward to winning and keep helping my team win in any way I can."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"The first game Iowa State doubled, and we knew that going into the game. Second game, North Carolina didn't double, and we won that game. Then this last game, they said they might play one-on-one, they might double. So just watching a little bit of film on them and just doing research. But just trusting my teammates. If teams want to double-team me, I don't mind passing it. I trust them. I told him be ready for the rim, and he was ready. But my guards was also ready. They trusted me to get me on the side. I was able to get the ball back out to them. I mean, I don't know."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN CARDWELL,"Well, in our scouting report we knew they had three really good shooting guards. They're the best three-point shooting team in the country percentage-wise, and we just didn't want them to get too hot, and we had to make sure that we stayed on our shooters. 11, Hunter, is a great shooter pretty much makes 50 percent of his shots. Just why let him get an open three just run him off the line. We were very locked into our scouting report. It was a short turnaround from yesterday. Coach Pearl said -- before the first game, before yesterday's game we had 18 hours to play two games. So for this team to buy in and lock in in this 18-hour window is just something special to see."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN CARDWELL,"We're just a tough scout. I'll leave it at that. Coach Pearl brought in some guys that when you're scouting guys, you don't know who to stop. I'm sure I wasn't on anybody's scouting report offensively and then I just go off for 18. You don't know who it's going to be. Coach Pearl always says it's going to be a different guy every night, and you saw in this tournament. It could be Chad, it could be Chaney, can be Denver, can be Tahaad. It could be anybody. All of our games it's someone different. It's just amazing to see. That's the difference I've seen in this year's team in comparison to years past. We're just a bunch of dogs."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"I know for me, I've definitely watched this tournament most of the time growing up. Probably the biggest tournament in basketball besides March Madness. But when Auburn was in it and they played UConn and those guys, I was at Morehead still but I was watching that tournament, as well. I've always watched it."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"To win it, it feels amazing. I always talk about my teammates and my coaches, but the Auburn family is really a family. It feels better to win it with the guys in the locker room since we've been grinding this whole year and everybody with a smile on their face, holding trophies up, being able to celebrate, it's great. It feels good to me."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN CARDWELL,"For me, just look at the field we had to go against and to come out on top, you have a lot of respected programs, UConn, UNC, Michigan State, Memphis, all great teams, Dayton and Colorado. If I'm missing somebody I apologize --"
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,Iowa State.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN CARDWELL,"Iowa State, good grief. It's a tough field. We knew that coming in. Just to go out on top, it means a lot to me and gives this team confidence in each other and the scouts that we have."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DYLAN CARDWELL,"Yeah, a year ago pretty much this week Johni and I became friends. The first year he was here, I looked at him as an opponent rather than my teammate, and that kind of showed on the court. I wasn't cheering for him. I wasn't really happy for him as I should have been. Last year, the Lord really challenged me in that Virginia Tech game. I prayed for Johni in warm-ups, and he dropped 30. But with him dropping 30, I only played nine minutes. The Lord gave me an option. He's like, you can either be happy that my prayer was answered or I could be stingy that my teammate went off for 30. After that Virginia Tech game we went on to play in New York, and Johni got subbed out and then I went 6 for 6 from the free-throw line, and the loudest person in that arena was Johni Broome. After that, he earned my respect, and I looked at him -- not really earned my respect but became a brother to me because I realized that he was not my opposition but he was a brother and he was a teammate, and that's something that Coach Pearl has been telling us since we got here, I'm going to bring in guys that you're going to love on that are going to be there for you for the rest of your life. The guys in the locker room are not the opponent, and that's what you see today. We have so many guys that are happy for one another rather than looking at them as competition, and I feel like once I let my pride go and I let that go, Johni and I's relationship really took off."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"Well, let's make one thing clear. Every film session, the first clip, BP says, we can't get beat 5050 balls. That's how he starts the film session every time. That's probably the one thing that you will get subbed out for that he don't play with is being out-hustled, being not the most exciting team to play. So getting to 5050 balls and rebounding and things like that, that's effort. That's things you can control. I feel like everybody in our locker room takes that accountability on doing that in order to win the ballgames and help us."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Anybody that says student-athletes have changed, anybody that says this is not all about the student-athletes, anybody want to complain about this or that, this is old-school pride, old-school love of their teammates, love their coaches, love their university. Just grateful, giving God the glory, so on, so forth. Kids haven't changed. Kids want to be coached. They want to be held accountable. They want to be believed in, and they want to be held to a high standard. That's just not changed. A lot of things around our game have changed, but this should give you guys and everybody watching hope because it's all about these kids and teaching them, and I'm just very proud of these young men."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Memphis is better from the three and free than they are from two. And so the whole scouting report was that's the only way you can beat us is to beat us from three. So we pressed up. We switched out. We didn't mind bad matchups, but we just had to make sure we didn't leave perimeter. We just didn't allow any advantagedisadvantage, or not a whole lot. As a result, Haggerty played well and was able to make some tough twos. But that was what the defensive game plan -- again, Corey Williams and Chad Pruitt, that team at Iowa State, Iowa State's guys are really,really good. They're really, really good. Then Mike Burgomaster and Ira Bowman and his scout team had North Carolina. What an honor to go up against the Tar Heels. And then Steven Pearl, my son, had this one tonight. Steven is sort of my defensive coordinator, and he kind of helps guide us there. Mike Burgomaster is my offensive coordinator, and he and I put the offensive game plans together. I thought our coaches just did a tremendous job, and like Dylan talked about, short prep. Like we had 18 hours to get ready for Memphis, but that scouting report was on my desk when I got back to that hotel and we were able to get the guys ready real quick."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Mike Burgomaster is a great story. Like a lot of guys on our team, come from pretty humble beginnings. He was a manager at Miami and wanted a GA job. Usually GA jobs go to former players. But I met Mike on a recommendation from one of my former assistants Harris Adler and the guys down at Miami, and I was impressed with his mind and brought him up as a GA. And I'm not letting him go. He was able to take my system, our system, Dr. Tom Davis' system, and together we've been able to blend it with some of the harder actions to guard in basketball, whether it's European basketball or whoever is doing what. In some way, I'd like to think that we've been doing some things for a few years that we are now seeing other people doing. It's about working as a team. So Mike is -- what happens is we develop these offensive systems and then Mike, like an offensive coordinator, is my play caller. Like just like a football coach who would have the headset on, and Mike is, okay, what's next, what's next. Nine times out of ten, I'll go with what he's got."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Well, obviously Maui is a prize. We're so happy for the people here in Lahaina that the Maui Invitational and this field with this incredible group of coaches and programs were able to come back to the island. You know, I saw my picture up there on the wall, and it was like Bill Self and Mike Krzyzewski and Tom Izzo and -- I'm like, what am I doing up here? Come on. I think Pearl must have paid somebody to put his picture up there. But now my team and our coaching staff put us up there. The other one that matters to me that's up there, 1987, Dr. Tom Davis brought his Iowa team here. I was an assistant and we won the fourth Maui Invitational. We came here a couple years ago with Auburn and we won two games and lost to Duke by four. That team got to the Final Four. This has been a great springboard, but the confidence that we're going to get from this is we know we can play with anybody. Where do we go from here. I promise you this, we will stay humble and hungry. We will not begin to think much of ourselves. If we stay healthy, we continue to get God's blessing, we'll be in position."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Yeah, JP had his best game for us. His confidence has been a struggle a little bit. He was much better defensively today, locked in, more aggressive, and we need him. Like these guys talked about, it's the sum of our parts. So he's got to fight, fight, fight to be able to keep his own confidence, his aggressiveness. So having him play so well -- Chad Baker-Mazara will not get a lot of talk about, but he was one of our most consistent performers. I mean, makes tough shots, shoots a great percentage. If I did more to get him more touches and put the ball in his hands more, people would be talking about Chad Baker-Mazara nationally for how good a player he is. I hope NBA scouts saw how good a player he is, and again, how unselfish he is and how productive he is. He almost always wins the plus-minus. We're just always better with him on the floor because we've got to do it at both ends. We talked about Denver Jones being one of the best defensive guards in the country, and now playing both 1 and 2. Tonight, Miles Kelly did not play very much because he had a little bit of an issue with his wrist, and quite frankly could not even shoot the ball, but he wanted to be out there for the first run, first possession of both halves because he wanted to see us get off to a good start defensively, and even if he couldn't shoot the ball, which he probably could not, we put him out there. What a teammate."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Well, we knew we had a good team coming back. I just want to keep in mind that Tahaad pedestrian for is probably the only five-star on that team. All those kids have had to work so hard to improve and grow. Dylan Cardwell has been in the program five years, Johni Broome three years, Chris Moore five years. We haven't had a lot of transfers. We've had a lot of guys stay. We've graduated 32 African-American students in the last 10 years. I don't think anybody in the country can say that. We've graduated 40 kids in the last 10 years, and we're proud of that. There's a correlation, I believe, between the discipline and the accountability and the responsibility to be Auburn men. You heard the kids talking about Auburn over and over and over again, what that means. It means responsibility there. Now, we don't always represent the way we'd like to, but I think that there's definitely some reasons why we scheduled up as hard as we possibly could, because I wanted to give these kids the opportunity. Now we've got to see if we can take advantage of it."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Yeah, Johni has grown a great deal. I know that he's a big guy, okay. Let's just say Johni is 22 years old, so let's say I got him when he was 19. He was a young 19, even though he's a large man. He was young. He's the youngest of a few kids in that family, and he's grown up. He's matured. One of the things he talked about is Coach trusts me. I try to hold him accountable. I try to have high expectation for them. So we knock heads, because I'm not satisfied. I know you're capable of more. But he's responded really, really, really well to that. But he's matured. He's become a really good leader on this team. He won't let us celebrate this too much. We'll celebrate it for a day or two right now and have a happier Thanksgiving, and then when we travel back, we'll get back to work."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TAMIN LIPSEY,"Yeah, I'd say it's just a great test for us to come together and play these great teams at this great event. Obviously there's going to be ups and downs in many games, like we saw playing the three games here. Just coming together as a team, just learning about each other. We haven't played very many games together yet, so just learning, getting better, improving, and having fun, most importantly."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",MILAN MOMCILOVIC,"We still have a lot of room to get better. I think today we scored 99 points. Our offense is getting better. But we've still got to clean some things up on the offensive and defensive end, but we're going to be really good."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",MILAN MOMCILOVIC,"Yeah, I think first of all, Colorado, great team. On the defensive side they were more gap heavy, so the guards, Tam and Key, Curt, they just drove downhill and kicked it out to me and I was wide open. Give credit to all the guards. You never know what to expect on the third day early in the morning, so just go out, whatever the energy is, and play hard."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TAMIN LIPSEY,"Yeah, obviously the goal here is to win it all and go 3-0. Came up a little bit short, but 2-1 with this greet field of great teams, nothing to be sad about. Obviously learned about ourselves, each other, so going into some good time to get some rest, heading back into Marquette. Looking forward to that game and preparing and getting healthy."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, Maui has been good for us. I really wasn't happy with some of our guards yesterday. We challenged them, and let me say a couple things right off the bat. As you know, Jase Richardson couldn't play after the game. His head was just bothering him and didn't pass all the protocol. I think he's going to be okay, but that was one thing."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TOM IZZO,"So hats off to Tre for taking advantage. Then there's Book. We've all been looking, that aggressive dunk, the couple of plays, he just missed a couple of other ones. That's the Book we've been waiting for now, and we're going to get more consistent on it. But for a guy that's gone through what he's gone through, he deserves to feel good and be a major part, a major part of a big win."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TRE HOLLOMAN,"You know, they beat us last year in the tournament, so we just came out and we tried to come out fast, strong, because we still had that bad taste in our mouth from last year. We just had something to prove, and we just came out and started strong."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",XAVIER BOOKER,"Yeah, I mean, really I just wanted to affect the game in any way. Obviously you guys know me as a three-point shooter but I know I can do way more than that, and I wanted to impact the game in other ways that my team needed me to. So grabbing offensive rebounds and then putting back up, playing the right spots, playing defense, posting guys up. I'm more than just a three-point shooter, and the guys around me, the guys I practice with every day, they know that and I know that. That's kind of the main goal for me is to keep building on this game. But no, the second half, that was my main goal, just try to impact the game in any way possible."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TRE HOLLOMAN,"It just meant a lot to me because, like I said, we lost to them last year. We just came in with vengeance, like we're not going to lose. This is a must-win. I am proud of my teammates, and I'm proud of Coach for just getting that win."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Yeah, Jeremy and Tre are pretty good with the ball, but make no mistake, we missed Jase, too, because he's cool and casual -- cool with the ball and doesn't get rattled by anything. I thought Jeremy did a great job in a lot of ways, and then the mistakes were glaring, and he's got to -- he told the team that's not going to happen anymore, so I give him credit. He did make his free throws, and that was big. We didn't turn the ball over too bad, but we had our moments. In an overtime game, 12 turnovers, they only had 11. I thought our rebounding, we out-rebounded them by eight or nine and that was a big factor, and we got to the free-throw line, which we think is important, and we shot 77, 78 percent from the line when we got there. For all the fans back at home that are mad at me about our three-point shooting, it was in the 30s yesterday and we lost, so thank God we got it back down into the 20s and won because that's what it's all about is winning games, not how pretty you win them, not any other way you win them, you've just got to win them. But I will say this That is a very good basketball team we played. Right now those three guards might be the best three-guard tandem I've ever seen, and I mean that. We did a good job, but I didn't think RJ was himself in this tournament so far. I've seen him just light up things. And I love Trimble. He just has gotten so much better. Hubert is a good coach. It was a good win for our program. I'm sure they'll learn stuff from it. Too. They're never out of a game as you saw. We warned our players, they've been down 21, they've been down 19, they've been down 18, and Hubert is probably saying why are we down. But he'll figure that out. That'll end up a very good basketball team because guard play is so important, and they've got good guard play."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, I mean, give them credit, it's their fourth game in a couple extra days. They stopped and played in Honolulu. I did that a few years ago, and I didn't see any of their guys cramping, but we thought if we could keep running maybe we could wear them down. That's tough, and the three days in a row is tough. But it is the same for them, and if anything we had a little advantage because that played that extra game. Now, losing Jase, one of our leading scorers yesterday, was tough, because we just didn't have the rotation at the guard spot we normally have. But I felt like in that overtime, the shot Trimble hit -- I think it was Trimble, right? It was incredible, very well-executed play. They had the hammer on one side and we fell asleep on the strong side. But I felt like our players believed we were going to win. I thought we deserved to win the game. So when you can say that in a huddle, for a guy who's more negative than positive, maybe for once in my life that helped."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Questions for Coach.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"I mean, it's so many things. It's so many things. I can't remember the last time we got out-rebounded by 16. I mean, that's what we do to people. But there's discipline mistakes, which is bad coaching. Just not being in the right spots. There's obviously the free throw discrepancy thing that's gone on the whole time we're here, which is a by-product of a lack of discipline and other factors. It's scary that a five-point game with five minutes to go turned into that. When you come to a tournament like this, and it's three games in three days, it starts to go bad, there's no way of fixing it 'cause there's no time to. You just have to deal with the situation. It was a humbling trip obviously for the program that's accomplished what we've accomplished."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"It's tough to do. We just looked so young compared to them. I mean, minus Alex and Samson, Hassan, we have a lot of younger players. The older guys that we brought in, we're not going to be very actual if we can't get more out of them. I just think we need to get back and we need to regroup both from a psyche standpoint and come up with a different plan defensively for the most part."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"I don't know. We're a pretty efficient offensive team. We missed a lot of open shots. Liam had some great looks and some things at the rim. I think offensively we'll be fine. Defensively, though, man, it's been a disaster here for us. The amount of times we just have been driven, I don't even know overall what the whole free throw thing was like through the three-game stretch out here, how much we were outscored at the free-throw line. We were minus 20 today, so..."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Yeah, listen, this UConn team that has lost three in a row out here is not the UConn team that we've been. It's the UConn team that we are right now that I think is going to get a lot better. We're relying on a lot of young players. The burden of wearing the uniform after back-to-backs right now looks like it's weighing heavy on the group. I think right now we just got to try to focus on becoming a good team and becoming a tougher team. To allow a five-point game, obviously there was a flagrant one there, that was a game that we were missing lobs in transition, blowing opportunities. Right now we're a shell of what we've been."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thank you, Coach."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, for sure. We're not going to let this game define who we are. Obviously we played against a really good team, No. 4 team in the nation. We wanted to win it. We didn't take care of business today, but we learned a lot from this entire weekend and saw that we belong. You let a team get out 9-0 on you that's the No. 4 team in the nation, you can't recover from that. Then our weaknesses showed up today. They exposed us on the glass, and that's something we talk about all the time as a group. I feel like we grew from this weekend, and it's something we're only going to get better. This is a new team, 13 new players. To get to the championship, not knowing each other, not being in a battle before this weekend with the best teams in the country, I'm really proud of the effort and looking forward to getting back to practice after Thanksgiving and enjoying this Thanksgiving."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PJ HAGGERTY,"Yeah, that was a pretty good defensive team. I think that wasn't really our problem. I think the problem was just rebounding. But getting in the paint, I think we really didn't have a problem. We missed a couple of bunnies that we normally make, but that's just part of the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",COLBY ROGERS,"I mean, they're a big, physical team. When they crash, they crash really hard. You've got to give credit to bloom, called well, the other business. They kept the ball alive. We just didn't match their physicality as we should have, and they kind of exposed us with that. So give them credit, but we've just got to be better rebounding. We need all five to rebound, especially against a team like that that kind of lives on the glass. But it's a good learning experience. I think we'll grow from this."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PJ HAGGERTY,"Yeah, for sure. We played some top-10 teams. None of those games were easy. We fought hard, came out the last one and lost. But at the end of the day it's just one loss. We'll be back in the gym over break and just work on things we've got to work on, and we'll be back for sure."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",COLBY ROGERS,"I think we have a lot of confidence. Like Coach said, we're a new team. To make it to the championship against two top-5 teams, that's something to really hang your head up about. I don't think we should leave here hanging our heads down, feeling like -- obviously we lost, there's no moral victories, but to go 3-1 on this road trip, I think this gives us a lot of momentum going into break. We've just got to make sure we learn from this, grow from it, and just don't let this carry on for too long. It's just one game, and we have a long season ahead of us. As long as we're playing our best basketball in March, that's what really matters. I think we've just got to keep the main thing the main thing and just enjoy this moment, go back home, regroup, and then just keep working."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Well, obviously me being a basketball player that played at the highest level, I understood what they were going to do to PJ and Tyrese. They were going to make it hard. They were denying them the ball. Every time he drove, they were there to try to stop him. It was a total team effort, and I knew that was going to happen today because why wouldn't you when those were the two hottest guys in the tournament, PJ and Tyrese. We have to do a better job when we get back of just learning from everything that happened this weekend -- I'm sorry, this week. And just keep getting better. But I knew that they were going to do what they did today. I would have done the same thing."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"We had all the answers to the test before the game. We knew exactly how they were going to play. We played them two years ago with Johni Broome and Caldwell, and the mentality has to be that you're going to go into a fist fight, a bare-knuckle fight. We knew that going in, but there's nothing you can do when that ball goes in the air except for hit and box out, and we didn't, and that 9-0 run to start the game pushed us pretty much out of reach. The way they were playing gave them the confidence, and they pushed them away, and then we weren't rebounding. We went zone four possessions and stopped them all four times, and they got the rebound three out of four, I think, and they made two threes in that possession, in those possessions. No game plan can prepare you for that. Practice does. Now they have to know to take the rebound. We talk about rebounding all the time because we know what it's going to come down to Protecting the ball and rebounding. We just didn't do it today."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"You know, like I said, I've never shied away from saying that we wouldn't add someone if it was fitting. But Dain, Moussa and Nick, it has to start with those guys on the glass. They have to take everything personal, and then the guards have to rebound, as well, and I think we will after this tournament because experience is the best teacher. They showed us how to get it done. Johni has been there three years Caldwell has been there four years. Those guys have paid their dues and they've gone through their bumps and bruises. They came to win today, and we just couldn't overcome that."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Oh, way more locked in. When he first transferred to Auburn he was probably a little distracted and thought it was going to be easier. I think he got a reality check of what it was like to come up, and then now he understands the lay of the land. He knows how serious he has to be, knows he has to be a leader, and he's doing that now. That's a total difference from two years ago to now with him."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"It was the same. Lahaina has always been great to all the teams coming over. They show the appreciation from the first day. They come out and they support. That's the great thing. You can tell they want this tournament back here, like after the wildfires, and that it belongs here, and that it'll be here for a lot longer. We're happy to come every time because it's such a beautiful place with beautiful people."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"I mean, you're getting into two championship games against two really good teams. Villanova was hungry, hungrier than us. It came down to one-on-one kind of basketball like we kind of did today. It was kind of similar. As a coach you can only put the guys in position, and it came down to a rebounding game. They made a ton of threes on us in the Bahamas. They got really hot. Here it came down to a reasoning game, and I'm going to always say that when you get in championship games, the ball can bounce any way, but you've got to be able to rebound and box out. Until we get that mentality, which we didn't have that last year, we get that mentality, then we'll be champions instead of finishing runner-up. But this game was totally different from that Bahamas because they just got hot from three. I think they made like 12 threes in the first half. This was just straight, grind it out fight that we lost."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, it wasn't a good response. It was basically -- you've got to think these young men have nerves. They haven't been here as a group. It's a new team. It's the beginning of the season. It's like Jason said, it's early, and if we would have said we would have been 3-1 in that stretch instead of 1-3 or 0-4 or something like that, then we would be very disappointed. But to be 3-1 on this stretch, there's nothing to be ashamed of. But what I saw was a nervous team that didn't make the challenge to hit and box out. If you hit and box out this game, the game is totally different. You've got to be able to do that against teams like this."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Welcome Dayton to the room. We have coach Anthony Grant.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"I'm so proud of our guys. Three really challenging games. Like we talked about before the tournament started, we knew this was one of the most challenging fields, a great tournament. We're always fortunate to be able to be invited to this, so we're grateful. Our guys really battled. I think we really grew up here in the tournament. We had three very challenging games, games that we had opportunities to win on every single night. We had to do some things better tonight. We understood that, against a UConn team that's extremely talented and well-coached. We knew we would have to play really well, especially on the defensive end. Just proud of our guys, the resiliency, the toughness, the togetherness, the heart we showed throughout the whole tournament. This didn't feel like a seventh-place game tonight. Our guys understood the opportunity. The things we've talked about all year in terms of our goals, what we're trying to do, they understood that. I'm really proud and grateful."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Questions for the players.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",NATE SANTOS,"I think it means a lot. Obviously we had really, really close games, the two games prior. I think, like Coach said, we really grew up, really put a full game together. I think we realized what we're really capable of. It was good to see that we finished the game off strong."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ENOCH CHEEKS,"Trying to put two halves together. The last two games, we couldn't close out. We were really locked, focused, trying to keep our composures. We knew if we did that, we was going to have the game. It meant a lot."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",NATE SANTOS,"Yeah, I think every game that we've played, it's been a fight. I think we've just continued to grow and come together and get better, just build trust in each other and just continuing to fight and staying together. I think obviously we saw what we can do in a full 40 by fighting together tonight. I think we really did a good job."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ENOCH CHEEKS,"It means the world when we have our fans behind our backs, it gives us energy, it motivates us to do better. We're very grateful for them. They show out every game at home. When it's away, it means the world."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",NATE SANTOS,"I'm backpack off that. It means a lot. Gives us energy, especially close games. It's great that they're here and we appreciate them."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thanks, guys. Questions for Coach."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"Yeah, I mean, the guys said it. I think we needed to be able to put two halves together. I think their resiliency is what propelled them. Just the desire to do whatever it took. We knew it would be hard. We talked about the need to do hard stuff. You could hear on the bench in the second half them encouraging and pushing each other. This is three really, really challenging games in three straight days. I think every team will tell you that's really hard to do. That's really hard to do in three consecutive days. Our guys found that resiliency, that toughness, that grit to be able to do that, and understand what it was going to take. It was going to take a 40-minute game. Obviously the score doesn't indicate how challenging that was at the end of the day. I'm just proud of the group."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"That's what it takes. We talk a lot, you heard me say this prosecute, that the sum has to be greater than the individual parts. It's always going to be a team game. On different nights, it's going to be different guys. Really proud of what Posh Alexander was able to do today. He was a big reason why we were able to win the way we were able to win today. It's just up and down the line, different guys. It's been different guys. This experience of being here and playing in this tournament, the competition that we got a chance to play against, I think will help propel us as we move forward."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"Yeah, I mean, he's a guy that makes winning plays. That's probably the best way I could put it. He's just a winning player on both sides of the ball. He impacts the game not just by scoring, not by what you see at the end of a box score, but his footprint. He's an intangible guy, great defender, a guy that understands how to impact winning. I think he's an underrated guy on both sides of the ball. It's great that the stat sheet kind of indicates what he's capable of. I think he's one of those guys that you need to be able to win at any level."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"Big-time. I feel like offensively we play really well. I think our guys are understanding the pace we want to play at, how to play together, to support each other, to help each other have success."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"For me, my mind is all wrapped up in our team. To me it's always going to be about what the team does. Like I always say, the sum is going to be always greater than the individual parts."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thank you, Coach."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DRAKE POWELL,"I think they just didn't fall, really. I thought we took great shots. I thought the right players took the shots. Yeah, they just didn't fall."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ELLIOT CADEAU,"I think we just shifted our focus on defense. I fell like we never have a problem offensively and scoring, so it was just a matter of getting stops, and that's basically all we were talking about in the huddle, just getting stops, getting rebounds, and that's what we tried to do."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ELLIOT CADEAU,"Yeah, it was a play for RJ in the corner and also the second option was Seth coming back on the screen and that was the read, so we got that."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DRAKE POWELL,"Personally, as a kid coming from Pittsboro you don't get to come out here to Maui and see the things that I've seen. I've seen great views and just play the game that I love with the people that I love at a place that I love."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ELLIOT CADEAU,"Yeah, I just remember it being a big shot and I missed, but I told Seth in the huddle thank you for having my back, and he came back and hit the shot for me. So yeah."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ELLIOT CADEAU,"I feel like we feel hungry now. We know that nothing is going to be given to us, and we just learned a lot from it. I think the main thing we learned from it is our toughness just has to be better. We have to be more tough. I feel like we're going to start bringing that every day in practice. We have to. We have no choice. So I think that's one thing."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DRAKE POWELL,"Well, first, you're exactly right. We come out flat and put ourselves in a hole to where we're trying to come back the whole game. Like Elliot said, I think it's just the toughness. We've got to want to get the 5050 balls, want to get defensive rebounds, offensive rebounds. We've have to do all the dirty work, and I think we'll do that continuing forward."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",DRAKE POWELL,"Just to keep playing and just growing my game, and whatever is asked of me by my coaches, my teammates, I feel like I can do it at a high level. Yeah, just going forward, just looking forward to the next game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Well, I thought he had a huge impact on both ends of the floor. I thought like his left defensively when we tried to get to the basket, if he didn't block a shot, he altered a shot. I felt like from an offensive standpoint, he played to his size. I would say normally he drifts to the outside and shoots threes and did a really good job rolling to the basket. Offensive rebounds, being able to finish around the basket with his length and his athleticism. I thought he caused problems with us on both ends of the floor."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,I've thought about a lot.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Well, the separator is just the possession by possession, little details here, whether it's -- it just comes down to a make-or-miss situation. We put it into overtime, and as you mentioned, we were able to take the lead in overtime, and those times you've got to tighten the screws in terms of the discipline and details of getting stops. Guys, they scored 50 points in the paint. I mean, just in shot 55 percent from the field. I mean, you guys can keep asking me questions, but it's right here. We have to improve defensively. To say that we took it to overtime letting a team score 55 percent from the field, 50 points in the paint, they beat us on the boards and they beat us at the free-throw line and it went into overtime? I mean, it's right here."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Well, I definitely think this gives time to be able to look and do a deep dive in terms of doing something, maybe tweak, a little pivot, alter, or maybe even change because what we're doing defensively is not sustainable, especially against good teams. We've always struggled defensively in the first half. Second half we've picked it up. Now with the level of play that is increased, it's made it even more difficult. So yeah, you're right. We've got a game next week, and we've got a full week to really take a close look at some things that we're going to have to change or maybe stay the course and work even harder to be able to put us in a position to do better consistently for longer periods of time on the defensive end."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"I'm not going to comment on that, but I never use profanity. I never show up anybody."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Well, I would disagree just because he had playing time that I'm gaining confidence. I don't equate confidence in regards to a number on a stat sheet. But I was very happy with the way that Ian and Drake played. I thought they stepped up for us on both ends of the floor, and I was happy with their effort tonight."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,I don't have any hair. Or limited hair.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"No, guys, this gives us a -- one of the things that I love about playing in this tournament and playing the competition that we're playing is it really gives you a clear picture on the things that you need to work on. There's things that -- there's problems that some people can't change. There's just no solution to it. And there's things that you can change. One of the things I told the team is the things that need to be changed I feel like can be with this group. I believe in this team. I love coaching them. They're a bunch of unbelievable and great kids, and I'm honored and blessed to be their coach."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"I don't think so. I've said before to play at our pace there needs to be a full commitment and everybody has got to be in the best shape of their life, and we check those two boxes. Again, we gave up 50 points in the paint. We gave up 50 points in the paint against Kansas. We only had the lead for a minute and eight seconds, and in the game last night we didn't take the lead once. We've got to find a way to get off to better starts in the first half and find a way to get better defensively and rebounding the basketball. Those are things that we're going to look at and fix and try to get better at."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"I wasn't a math major but I can add. 51 points of their 99 came off of offensive rebounds where we don't box out or we get punked, beat, whatever you want to say, and then the other 37 come off -- there's 37 off turnovers and 14 off second-chance points. So 51 of their 99 that we have a direct result of causing or giving up or whatever you want to say. With that being said, our half court defense wasn't very good, either. So you put the combination of the turnovers and not boxing out and not guarding as a team, and this is what you get against a good team. Iowa State is a hell of a program, hell of a team. They're well-coached. We're not. There you have it."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",ANDREJ JAKIMOVSKI,"We just couldn't get stops. For us everything starts on the defensive end0 and they scored 99 points, so we just couldn't get stops. And like Coach said, we didn't take care of the ball, and those are two huge things for us, and we lost that game. We've got to bounce back. It's a great experience for us. Three really good games. We got a taste of what Big 12 opponent is doing, and I think we're going to be ready."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"We played against three good teams. They pressure a lot. It's something that we haven't really seen as much at this high of a level. Iowa State does it on the ball and off the ball. I think what we can take from these games are just how to handle pressure better, especially in games like this where they're not just making us turn it over, like they're scoring out of it, which makes it impossible to guard and get back because transition defense when they're getting steals it's much harder than off a miss or if we're set up, so I think we're just going to take back getting used to the pressure and the physicality and all that just so we can get that going for the rest of the games and into league play."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"Yeah, I felt like they were pressuring and they would get out one time and then we would have a bad possession, maybe a quick shot, a bad shot, and they'd get out on those, too. So they'd just find a way to try and turn you over and then try and speed you up to get you to take a quicker shot. I felt like we let too many of those possessions just compound. We still scored 71 points, but a lot of it was just us not being able to get back and stop them."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Yeah, look, they were doubling him on the post. I told Elijah, as you go through this this season, people are going to figure out that you're pretty good down there, and there's certain teams that are going to say, okay, we're going to guard you one-on-one, and those are going to be the fun nights where you can go to work and do what you do, but there's other teams that are going to double you and take you out of the game. Now you have to become a distributor. Now there's two guys on you. Again, I wasn't a math major, but that means we've got four offensive players against their three defensive players, and we did a poor job collectively as guards, as bigs, you name it, not just Elijah, of exposing them. Iowa State, they rotate well, they play extremely hard. We had some really good offensive possessions where we moved the ball and we got one more and we got great looks. We just didn't have enough of them. We had too many where the ball gets poked, we turn it over. They're very good at getting their hands on balls in passing lanes. So we have to become better passers. Again, there's two on Elijah. We're playing four on three. We've got to get the ball to one of our guys and make them pay for doubling. That's something he hasn't experienced up to this point, and great opportunity to learn. But they trapped ball screens. Guess what, now the guard has two guys on him. He's got to get a ball moving. They're a much better passing team than we are. We've got to become better passers. Again, we did it at times. We just didn't do it consistently enough. As a player, you should relish playing against these kind of teams because you're going to get open looks as long as you take care of it. But if you don't, it's an avalanche coming down on your head, and that's what happened to us."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, I hope not. I hope we can get more consistent than what we've been here. You've seen we're the epitome of inconsistency in this tournament. Again, outhouse, penthouse, outhouse. But we've got capable players. We've got enough talent. We don't have the experience at this level that a lot of teams have. A lot of these teams have transfers that came from other Division I programs. Elijah Malone was playing NAIA basketball last year. Trevor Baskin was playing Division II basketball last year. We've got two freshmen that are playing that have no experience. Now, the rest of our guys have limited experience, Bangot Dak, Assane Diop. Julian and Andrej are probably our two most experienced players, but we don't have a roster full of them like some of these other teams. With that being said, early, and it's still early, we're still in November, we're going to have some growing pains. We're going to have some inconsistencies. I knew that before the season. It doesn't make it any easier when you're going through it, but we're going to have to -- but hopefully by January and certainly February and March, we can be more consistent than what we've been here because we have in my opinion enough talent. But so does Iowa State. So does every other team in the Big 12. That's what makes coming to these games, covering these games, playing in these games so much fun. At least when you play to your potential. Today is no fun, but it's a great opportunity for our players. It's a learning experience. I told myself before the season started, I have to have patience with this group. It's not in my nature. But that's kind of where we are right now."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 27, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, getting their hands on balls, poking balls. I mean, you can give credit to their defense or you can just say our offense wasn't good enough. You guys watched the game. You figure it out. I know our offense wasn't good enough consistently, and we were not strong with the ball."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Guys will be in shortly. We're trying to get them off their feet, back to the hotel. Having six guys in double figures was really, really good. The guys shared the ball really well. North Carolina is a great, great offensive team. We know they've come back from 20-point deficits before. Thought our guys stepped up their game. The start of the second half, for sure, but also start of the game extremely well. That's all."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Questions for coach.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Well, I think you got to remember where Johni Broome came from. That doesn't get talked enough about. He's a three star out of Temple Catholic. He's not fast enough, he's not quick enough, he's not good enough. He doesn't make the top AAU teams in Florida. He's a Loma junior, mid-major kid. All he's ever done his entire career is prove people wrong. Not an NBA player because he's not an NBA athlete. All he does is score and all he does is defend and all he does is win. He's old school that has developed always an inside game and developed a perimeter game. He's an outstanding passer. He's an outstanding ball handler. He can you put the ball down the floor to make plays. I trust him with the ball in his hands in the post. Obviously just a dominant, dominant rebounder. As far as just play calling for him, we got a guy we can throw the ball to and he can score down there. Forces double-teams, things like that. It's like having a guy like R.J. Davis who can just go get a bucket whenever he wants to off of the perimeter. I tell you what. Denver Jones, one of the best defensive guards in college basketball. He is one of the reasons why our team has won the games that we have won. Nobody talks about it, writes about it. I don't know how many times he scored. I don't know how many times R.J. Davis scored on him, but not many. I think the other guards, Miles Kelly, this is the best he's played in a big game for us. I thought he really guarded well. Didn't turn the ball over. Shot it really well. Chaney Johnson showed you what he's capable of. He's a miss matchup that forces position, a powerful player that has some perimeter skills. Our ability to guard is going to get challenged tomorrow because Memphis will drive in, they'll initiate contact, they'll fall on the floor. The game is really hard to referee."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"I think a combination of things. He worked really hard in the off-season. He's in the best shape of his life. He's going to graduate mid-semester. He wanted to come back and get his degree. Coach Dye talked about the great Pat Dye talked about having the student-athletes love Auburn because he loved Auburn. Our kids love Auburn. They love the support that we get from the fan base, the way our fans travel. He just goes out every night, tries to reward them. He's still got a big chip on his shoulder, but he's worked really hard. Ira Bowman does a phenomenal job on the inside. He and Steven Pearl have a great relationship. Steven can get on him, make him accountable, he listens. Mike, my offensive coordinator, does a great job getting him good touches where he is in position to finish."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"He's a nightmare to match up with. Chaney can do things on the perimeter. When you play North Carolina, you got to be able to switch one through four your fours have to be able to cover. So having Chris Moore and Chaney and Johni as my four men, they're all able to move their feet. Dylan Cardwell had a tremendous number of vertical plays. They're just driving into him. He's allowed to maintain his position and defend his position and wall up. I don't care how much people drive into you, you're allowed your space. It's like dirty dancing. This is my space, this is your space. I thought we were awfully vertical tonight."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Our perimeter defenders are always going to be challenged. Memphis is a tough cover. Three guards that are hard to stay in front of. They all make great one on one plays, make tough twos, threes they all shoot a lot of free throws. We're going to have to stay down, we're going to have to stay up, again, continue to try to guard where verticality. When they drive into contact, we hope we're able to maintain our position on the floor. They've got three pretty good inside guys, really, really athletic. They played a very tough schedule, like us. In other words, North Carolina played them in the pre-season. Penny always plays a tough schedule. He's got a lot of guys that transferred from big-time places. Playing great, great basketball."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Honestly, I don't know yet. We've taken them one game at the same time truly. I have not watched Memphis. I watched them today a little bit against Michigan State. Like what every team is going to do, we're going to do what we do, they're going to do what they do. Fatigue will be a factor. What time is it now? It's 900? What time did Memphis get done playing today? 1240. We're trying to get our guys back off their feet as quickly as we possibly can."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Look, coaches can help win games. Players win championships. They're holding each other accountable. They recognize that we got to close out and we got to compete. We can't take possessions off. Again, I thought we shared it. We only turned the ball over eight times. They had a negative assist-turnover ratio. That doesn't happen at North Carolina very often. Defensive rebounding wins championships. That's what we like to try to focus on."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thank you, coach."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Thank you, guys."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",JASE RICHARDSON,"Just going through the game, they were more physical than what they seemed on film, so they were definitely for physical defensively. There was a lot of pressure, they were pressuring full court and then half court it was all the way up. It was just getting used to that during the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",JADEN AKINS,I just told him to keep looking for me.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, there's no secret that we don't have a true go-to guy yet. Tre got his lip busted, and I never felt he was the same after that. It was a physical game there. I love the way they play. I do. I didn't think we matched that. But they are more physical -- not just athletic, but they are more physical. We had trouble getting into offense. I thought we could run them, and when we did run it at times, we ran pretty good. But when you think about missing a dunk and then missing all those free throws, it just goes to show what I've said all my career here I'm the one complaining about missing all those threes, so today we shoot 35 or 36 percent from three and lose because we didn't guard as well. I thought we took a couple of poor shots, and they got breakaway lay-ups on them. That's when Tre got busted in the mouth, and I didn't think he got back very well because he usually does a great job of that. Jaden played really well early. And give Penny credit, they choked them a little bit the second half, didn't let them come off those ball screens. I thought Jase did some really good things. He was so mad at himself for missing those free throws. But it is what it is. For a guy that has the experience that he has in college so far, I thought he played very well, too. Our bigs let us down today a little bit, and they've been playing really well. I don't know why, but maybe some of it was the competition."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, you know, it's funny because I kind of agree with you. But paint points, 32-22, but they had at least eight or ten on breakaway lay-ups, so those are points in the paint that aren't physical. Fast break points, 11-5. Again, those three or four breakaways when our point guard did not get back, points off turnovers, 22-10. Some of those are undefendable. I look at it, our defense, we held them to 55 shots, we held them to eight threes, but they only had six offensive boards. We out-rebounded them by eight. Turnovers we had a few more than them. We did some good things, it's just if you watched it where I watched it from, which I think you did, you've got to give Hunter a lot of credit. He made some shots that I'm sure Penny -- I don't know if Penny made those shots when he played, and I mean that. He was falling right, falling left, end of the shot clock, and he drained them. Give them credit there's a reason they beat UConn. But I think if I take something away from this game, a couple of stretches, I think we could play with just about anybody here so far. We'll see what happens tomorrow."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TOM IZZO,"I'd like to go back to Northern Michigan. It's safer up there playing a Division II school than some of these schools. Laughter. I didn't think we quit. I didn't like the fact that I thought we got punched in the mouth and didn't respond early enough, and then responded. But it's because we've got a lot of new guys in different roles not a lot of new players. But it was a hard prep in one day, too, because they're shooting 48 percent, and we tried to change our ball screen coverage a little bit and had some success. To be honest with you, they beat us on one-on-one. I think they only had like eight or ten assists. They only had ten assists. That was one-on-one they beat us. They didn't beat us on actions as much, just one-on-one, and those two players -- Hunter was one of them, but boy, the other kid played pretty well, too, Haggerty. One of our goals was to keep him off the free-throw line. That's why we changed our ball screen coverage. He gets four free throws, he's averaging 10. We did enough of those things. We shot it well enough. It was the easy buckets they got. It was the lack of making free throws, which has been one of our strengths. Then give credit, someone is going to have to really play well no matter what they do, not to be MVP of this tournament the way he shot it. He's made some big plays."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TOM IZZO,"I don't believe in the rest. Rest when you're dead. You know, it wasn't like we're going to go beat the hell out of them tonight. We're not going to play the war drill or something. But we've got to give them enough information to play the game, and everybody is going to be doing the same thing. I'm looking forward to it. Either way, we're playing a top 10 team, I think. The third game, a lot of times it's won on who wants to play, not who's the best to play or who plays the best even. It's who wants to play. I think this is a great experience for us. The tournament has been awesome. No complaints. A call or two here and there, but no complaints, to be really honest with you. I just wish we would have made some free throws. I wish we would have defended a couple of those ball screens a little better and gotten back on defense. The shots he made, I can't blame any of our players for some of those. It was -- there were some hellacious shots. No, this will be all good. It's go home and work get to sleep on the plane. What the hell you want to sleep for? I've seen enough of the island. I've been here six times. Love the island, but love the film room. So I think I'll just go to work tonight a little bit."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, it does a lot, but it's not all Jaden's fault. We didn't do a very good job getting him the ball, I guess, and give them credit. I mean, I think Penny really likes his team. We were kind of neighbors in our hotel there and talked a few times. I think he likes his team, and rightfully so. They play incredibly hard. They've got incredible guard play. Hell, we must have done a hell of a job there shooting 48 percent, and today they shot 34 from the three. There's something we did right. But just so disappointing in us not getting back. Those four baskets and those five free throws, that really changes a game. We've got to get Jaden more involved. That's not all Jaden, that's us. We've got to do a better job of that. I want to be able to get 14, 15 shots a game. He still led us in shots but didn't get enough of them if you ask me. So I'd agree with you on that."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Congrats to Colorado and Tad. They played an inspired game and a great second half. Credit to them. Obviously we didn't expect to find ourselves in this position out here based on where we've been. But this is where we are. Just defensively in the second half, just really, really bad. We've been bad out here defensively. Then obviously I think the foul trouble has taken its toll, too."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",SOLO BALL,"It was definitely a collective effort. Defensively we weren't there. We were in the right spots, and they got a lot of open shots that we couldn't prevent. I think just focused on the defensive end, that's the big goal for us the rest of the season."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",SOLO BALL,"Yeah, Coach definitely talks about putting more pressure on the offense and not letting them just do whatever they want. They kind of just got to wherever they wanted today, and that's what hurt us today."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",SOLO BALL,"Yeah, definitely. It's difficult being in this position, but as a team we've just got to be able to lift each other up and move on to the next game because we have a long season to go. Of course it's two tough losses, but it's about how we recover from these and get better."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"You know, that's not -- it has a big impact, obviously, on the game. I don't know if it's called an over the back. We obviously go to the free throw at that point and maybe we're shooting a one and one. I don't know what the foul situation was at the time. It just speaks to how these last two days have gone for us, that yesterday the biggest play of the game was an over-the-back that was called against us, and then today it was more egregious because the kid Baskin pulled Liam's arm down. I saw the replay of it. Obviously it's ironic, but that's not why -- our defense has been just so dreadful, just so dreadful out here. We had opportunities. I was just surprised by just how -- we should have been fresh in the second half with Alex sitting most of the first half with Hassan sitting a large part with Samson in foul trouble. Obviously it's been a tough two days."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Yeah, I appreciate Tad saying that we're physical, but we're not physical. We play hard. There's some undisciplined fouls. Some of them are -- like Samson's first foul to start the second half where he picked up his third one really quickly, I just don't know is that a foul. In a game with so much grabbing and so much holding -- but some of it is sloppy, undisciplined technique, and some of it I just think in basketball, sometimes you just are not getting a great whistle. I don't think out here we've gotten a great whistle. It just hasn't kind of bounced our way out here. It killed us to have so many guys in foul trouble during the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Well, he got really involved. He only played a couple minutes in the first half, and then he got great shots in the second half. The guy is a two-time national champion. Just had a tough shooting night. I just kept telling him, just keep firing."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Yeah, I think we were hoping -- well, I don't know what Liam's status was. He went out for a little bit, something with his hip. I'm not sure what that's going to look like. Obviously we had five perimeter on the court, so we were just trying to create a little movement and fake a pitch and give Liam the option to either back-cut his guy on that empty side if he felt like he was being overplayed or kind of play back to the ball, get downhill, drive it, or Hass had the option to, if Aidan back cut there from the corner to drive it baseline and try to get to the rim. Obviously it didn't play out that way."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Ahmad in the first half -- I liked Ahmad in the second half. He showed his inexperience, but he plays with some physicality out there. I think he's going to be a good player. I think we have to play him. Listen, we could not afford Hassan and Alex to be in foul trouble in the first half. They put us in a very compromised position by sitting that whole first half. I was really impressed with how we played considering that first half, and at halftime I felt like we were going to do what we do at UConn, which was get it to double figures and then surge in that game. It just didn't happen for us. But it's early, and we're going to have a lot of chances to get these ones that we've given away, we're going to get a lot of chances to get these back."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"I saw grit, I saw toughness, I saw execution, I saw winners, just saw guys that really wanted this tournament. Wanted the game I should say. We know we want to win the tournament, but saw guys that just really got together, total team effort and pulled together to get a win against a very tough team."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"I don't know, maybe the shot my freshman year to send us to the Sweet 16 maybe. But I'm just really playing in the moment for us."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"Just my confidence, putting in the work. I know when I came to this program, just talking with Penny, it's like, you're shooting good, but you got to get more of them up and just trusting in that, trusting in my work ethic and just letting it play out through the summer, practice, into the games."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, we're just blessed, man, to have a great group of young men. God blessed us with this opportunity to have this great team. These young men, they need all the credit because we push them really hard. Even though they don't like it all the time, they respond. Right now you're seeing the response, like a reset. They put in so much work. These guys live in the gym. When it's time to compete, they get up to compete. Like yesterday was a game that could have drawn all the energy out because it was a really tough game. Come back today, to have that level of intensity again offensively and defensively just says a lot about them, and I just thank God to have these guys on my team."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PJ HAGGERTY,"Really just staying locked in, just the whole first and second half, just being us really, the Memphis way, and just out-toughing them. That's really been the motto."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PJ HAGGERTY,"Yeah, you know, I just try to do whatever we need to win the games. I try to find the spots to rebound. Coach said today was going to be a big rebounding day for the guards, so I was able to get in there, our big men boxed out well, so I was able to get in there and get some big-time rebounds."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"You for sure got to get down there and get physical. I think that's obvious that our main two centers are in the game and you've got to step up, but going to be prepared for it. I think our whole mentality coming into the game was being physical, hitting, boxing out, and I think they got probably one addition late in the game, so just trying to adjust quick."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"Just stay locked in like the last two games. Trusting the coaching staff, the game, the scout, that they're going to give us. Of course take care of our bodies physically, mentally, stay well put together, and honestly just go out and be us. I think we're confident enough to just play our game and go out there and try to win."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,What attracted me to Tyrese was his freshman year at Iowa State played us in Brooklyn and he demolished us. He just really had an unbelievable game as a freshman and I was a fan from that point on.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, we knew at some point they were going to get hot because they're not going to shoot the ball that poorly. They were like 352nd in the nation at 20 percent from three as a team. We knew that wasn't going to continue. They're competitors. Coach Izzo, I love Coach Izzo for a lot of reasons. First of all, his heart, his tenacity, his championship status, Hall of Fame, all of that. We knew that they were going to eventually make some shots. In the second half we started staying at home more. We started wanting them to throw the ball inside because we just tried to take the paint away early and make them shoot threes and just so happened they didn't make the ones they needed to make and then we had to adjust at halftime with trying to make the ball find the post and not giving them those threes."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, it is really weird because we went to overtime against BYU, and Tim Duncan was a teammate of mine, and I think it was that year -- no, it was the following year, I'm sorry. I got my ball stolen at half court at an inopportune time, and I still remember that play. To lose that game, because I really wanted to play against Duke, wanted to play against Bobby and those guys and just to not get an opportunity, to be here now full circle, to be in the championship game as a coach, man, that's just God. I just look at it in that fashion because it doesn't happen this well for a lot of people. So I'm just thankful for the opportunity for tomorrow."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Without R.J. playing, we do know who they are now and what they're trying to do because Coach Hubert does a great job. They didn't have RJ, and that makes a huge difference because he just takes over a game. So for us, it's kind of like you really don't know because we didn't play them full strength, and Moussa didn't play for us, and you really can't tell. But we do know their roster enough to know personnel better, especially the freshmen, and know how to approach tomorrow if they are to win the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"It's just a testament to the work that we put in. We have to push harder than any team in the country because we don't really get the respect. We have to earn everything that we get. So we put so much pressure on our guys, and it's almost unfair the amount of pressure because we have to win early to get the respect. We can't lose a game and then say they'll be better by January or February, because we haven't arrived yet. We have to put so much pressure on those young men, and they have the confidence. That crew is so tight that they're unified when they come to the gym, and they're ready to play when they touch the gym, and it doesn't matter who it's against."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"It feels good because as a competitor, as a former basketball player, to play, now coach, you want to be a part of the rare air in the NCAA. You want to be a part of that group that they mention with the Dukes and the Kansases. You want Memphis' name to be there. So you've got to fight, and you've got to grind, and that's why I have one of the top non-conference schedules every year, because we want to play the guys to kind of show who we are. That's all a part of it for us, man. It's a journey. It's always constantly trying to fight to get our respect, and little by little, hopefully we're getting there. We want that attention because we work so hard, we want it. We want to be a part of that."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"I can't say that with a new team, with 13 new players. I can't say I would have thought we'd be right here, right now, 6-0 in a championship game in Maui with the schedule that we've already played. Those two exhibitions against Carolina and Alabama did help us a lot, though."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Again, I said God can do everything but fail, so I'm not ever to the point where I don't think it could happen, but it wouldn't have been 6-0 in the championship game thinking right away with a new team. You'll take this any day, though."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, PJ is like a true professional. In this day and age you don't get a lot of young men who are ready to go when their number is called because they're over on the sideline pouting. He's not pouting. He's ready, and when his number has been called, he's been ready to go in every game. Definitely so happy for him because he puts a lot of work in, and just happy for him, as well."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"Obviously a hard-fought game. I thought our guys gave a great effort tonight, a quick turnaround from last night. Disappointing ending to last night's game and a disappointing ending tonight, but proud of our guys for the fight they showed. Yeah, I think for us, we knew this tournament, how talented a field this was coming in and how challenging it would be for us. We're just going to continue to try to control the things we can control and continue to get better, and we've got another opportunity tomorrow."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",MALACHI SMITH,"I think we proved that we're a top-25 team in this country and we can hang with anybody. We played two great teams, probably two top-10, I don't know what rank Carolina was, but two top-10 teams, and it came down to two possessions both games. I think we was in control of both games, but I think we learned good about ourselves, something good. Took some L's but going to turn it into lessons."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",MALACHI SMITH,"Yeah, they're a good team. Both teams we played were good. Iowa State, they did a good job of seeing what we've struggled at and they just kept with it. They were kind of bigger and physical than us, and that's what they did, got us in foul trouble. But they're a great team, so congrats to them."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"Yeah, as I told the guys, that's two games in the second half defensively we weren't able to capitalize on what we were doing offensively. I thought we were really, really good both games, both halves from an offensive standpoint. We were able to exploit some things there. But you've got to be able to get stops. You've got to be able to get rebounds. You've got to keep them out of transition. There's takeaways. There's things you've always heard me say. You want to try to learn through winning, and sometimes you learn through taking tough losses. For us, I think from an offensive standpoint, we were able to have some success ourselves against the No. 1 ranked defensive team in the country. So we have to be better defensively. If we can do that, we've got a chance to really take our team to another level. It's hard in the moment to see opportunity slip through your fingers because we had two great opportunities here. We've got another one tomorrow. We've got to have a short memory, so to speak. We've got to make sure we're prepared to face one of the best teams in the country, a two-time defending champ that is feeling a certain way about their games that they felt like they should have won, as well."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,I'd rather not comment.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"I think it was more than just turnovers. From a defensive standpoint, I felt like they were running their offense like they do in shootaround. They just didn't feel us defensively at all. There was no presence for us defensively. We had spurts, but nothing sustained on the defensive end. One of the things I always talk to the team about is for us to be good, we have to live and dwell in the trenches. What's in the trenches are the lose balls, rebounds, setting screens, getting through screens, those toughness plays. Auburn won all of them the entire game. They were better than us."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"I've said before early in the season we've had spurts of that, but the next step for us is to start there and to stay there for a full 40 minutes. It's also nice to have a guy like Broome. I mean, he's just the best player on the floor and it wasn't even close. There's a reason why he's first-team All-American. He has a chance to be national Player of the Year. Things looked slow to him. He just wasn't rushed. He was patient. Whether we doubled, whether he was by himself, whether he was running the floor, he just... He's in full demand of his game. He does so many things for this team. He generates shots for other guys. He can score. He can shoot from three. Draw around a basketball. Draw fouls. He's good defensively, can protect the paint. He's an excellent passer as well. He dominated this entire game. He was the best player on the floor. I don't think it was even close."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"It's the same thing about the trenches. I've said that it has nothing to do about physical size. It does with the size of one's heart. We have to be able to rebound the basketball. We have to be able to get those loose balls. We have to play with composure in situations and in games like this. I just felt like we lost our way, didn't do the things that we normally do out there on the floor."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thank you, coach."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,Thank you.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, yesterday, less than 24 hours ago I was sitting here questioning the fight of these guys. I think I said -- I know I said it to them, I can't remember if I said it in here -- that we would find out a lot about our team in the next 24 or 18 hours. And I think we found out about this team, the fight that they have, and they came back with. I wish we would have played like that against Michigan State. I think Michigan State had a lot to do with it. But number one, to beat a program like UConn, I mean, that's not easy to do. Coach Hurley is a hell of a coach. They run their stuff so well. They're hard to guard. These guys really battled all game long. Again, coming down the stretch, win or lose, I was going to be proud of this group. We finally won one there, we got a stop at the end and got a rebound. Andrej made a hell of a shot there on the play we ran. Elijah Malone with a terrific, Julian ran the team. Everybody that played for us played well and contributed to this win. Couldn't be more proud of this group."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",ANDREJ JAKIMOVSKI,"Coach trusted me to make the last play and he called a good play for me and I knew I had to go down there and finish, and that's basically it. It's a great team win, great bounce-back after a bad game yesterday. We showed character, and we defended our ass off. UConn is probably one of the best offensive teams that I've played in my college career. It's a great team win, and way to finish it."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"On that last play, I got on the ball, I saw he had a game, and Elijah did a great job sealing his man down there. Andrej had his guy one-on-one. I saw him get downhill, he got it up, and we all crashed because there was only five seconds left and we were down one, but when it came out of his hand, it looked good."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",ANDREJ JAKIMOVSKI,"I fall down and then I saw it went in. I thought I got fouled, but I made the lay-up so we won the game, so it doesn't matter."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"Yeah, they did go up 10, 11 on us, but I thought it was more our team because yesterday we went down 10, 11 and we folded. We started playing individual basketball. We played really apart. I thought today we just started to grind out possessions and make them work because they run a lot of action on offense. We want to make them work as much as they were making us work, and we just tried to wear them down."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"It's really just -- we can't get beat up the same way Michigan State beat us up. We thought they out-physicaled us and stuff like that. We went back, did our recovery, everything that we need for our bodies to feel good for today, and we just talked about it. Like all right, we can't let this happen again. We can't take bad shots. And then we just let it go, got into our UConn start."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",ANDREJ JAKIMOVSKI,"For us, everything starts on defense. I think if we keep getting stops and rebound the ball, nobody can beat us. We were great there today, and that's why we won the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",ANDREJ JAKIMOVSKI,"Our game plan was to play inside out, and Elijah has been awesome. He's playing great. At the beginning they were doubling him, so we got some wide-open threes, and then he was going one-on-one, and he missed some lay-ups, but he played great today, and that's why we won the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"You know, it feels good. It's exciting, obviously, to beat a program like that. They won the Natty back to back years, so that's always -- they're just a great team, so that's obviously great. But we know we're going to have a tough game tomorrow either way. We're going to be happy about this now and get back, see who wins at whatever time they play, I don't know, and then just be ready to go tomorrow because we can't beat too up on ourselves because we know we're going to be in for a tough physical game again tomorrow."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Like Andrej said, we always want to play inside out. We don't go into a game necessarily trying to foul somebody out. You always want to be aggressive. Look, UConn is an aggressive defensive team. I mean, they play physical, and it's one of those games where it's hard to officiate because they put so much pressure on the officials. We had a strong crew today that called it like they saw it. We talk about playing defense without fouling, and UConn, number one, they're deep, and number two, they run their offense as good as anybody in the country. I'm telling you, best offensive scheme I've seen in my 19 years as a head coach, quite frankly. But in terms of our game plan, we want to play inside out, play our game, take better shots. I was really disappointed in our shot selection last night. I thought it got a lot better today. Still took a couple tough ones. But definitely going inside to Elijah Malone. He is a weapon for us and he's a problem for other teams, obviously, because he's a load down there. They started doubling him at the end and then he started passing, and if we can start figuring that piece out, we'll be a pretty tough team to guard."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Yeah, I thought we had good looks in the first half we just didn't finish them. They beat us up at the rim a couple times. They lead the country in blocked shots, so they really -- we had some curls that should have been lay-ups that weren't. So in the second half we did a better job of finishing, and that's part of it. We made open shots, which you have to do when you get them against UConn, because again, they are a physical team defensively. That's one of the reasons they foul a lot. But you'd better be strong with the ball, from the guard position to the 5 spot, and we were."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, two reasons. Number one, we had a possession a few before that where we got down to the end of the shot clock and we didn't even get the ball to the rim. I thought to myself, well, KJ is not out there, Tristan is not out there, Cody is not out there. So I saved my time-outs for a reason, and that play at the end, option one is getting Elijah the ball down low. Julian has got to make that decision. Option 1A is getting the ball to Andrej, zipping up the lane there, and then we clear it out, let him go to work, and he did it. He made a tough shot. It was a make-miss game. Then we came down and got our stop. That play was designed for Elijah Malone and Andrej Jakimovski. Those two guys, the way they played tonight, their experience, their toughness, their physicality could handle UConn. You had to be physical to make the play that Andrej made, and he did it. I don't know if we have other guys that are physical enough to do that right now. Trevor made a hell of a play down the stretch, getting down the lane. But he had an angle on that one. That was the thought there."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, UConn is one of those teams, they want a dunk at the rim or they want a wide-open three. We told our team before the game, this is a different animal than Michigan State. Michigan State really struggled from the three-point line. UConn made 14 threes yesterday and lost. That's tough. Now, obviously that was an overtime game could have gone either way. We wanted to guard the three-point line more against UConn. Now, if they got some twos, we want them to be mid-range twos, not twos at the rim, but we wanted to take away threes. We did not do a very good job of that. I don't know what they ended up with from three, but they had 12 of them. Our goal is six or less for the opponent. Didn't do a very good job of guarding the three-point line. But it was a different game plan for different opponents, and whoever we play tomorrow it'll be a different game plan for them than it was for Michigan State or UConn."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 26, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"It takes character. Like these guys mentioned, it takes toughness, it takes belief in yourself, and our guys had that. Again, I mentioned the fact that we're going to learn a lot about this team in this tournament, and we learned from last night and we turned around tonight. The biggest thing I was disappointed in last night was our fight and our shot selection. This team, we challenged them, and they had better shot collection and a hell of a lot better fight. Really proud of them for that. But tomorrow is a new day. We've got to be ready to go whoever we play because they're going to be good."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Well, one of the things that we talk about with Auburn basketball is to try to make history, and we're very proud of the history of Auburn basketball and some of the great players like Charles Barkley or Chuck Person or great coaches like Sonny Smith and Cliff Ellis. This is our second top-5 win in the non-conference in the history of Auburn basketball. Not since 1990 when Kansas did it has a team started 5-0, including two top-5 wins. To this point, we've made history. But we're not celebrating. That was a really good Iowa State team. To put 49 on us in the first half -- we didn't play very well, but they played great. The guys did a good job at halftime kind of getting after each other and not quitting. Not having Chad Baker for much of that first half was a factor. We're a lot better with him on the floor. But I thought one thing I'm very proud of for these guys is they trust each other. They each took turns stepping up, and that there is as good a win as we're going to see and as good a game. Proud of my team and our coaching staff."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"I mean, first off, they called a time-out with 22 seconds left, and our first objective was to get a stop. We pride ourselves on defense, and as you could see, the second half we took a lot of pride in that. In order for us to get that last possession we've got to get a stop to win the game. We ended up getting a stop. Coach wanted a simple high ball screen with me and Denver. Denver drove, and we teach it every day in practice, worst thing to do is get them the room. Me and Denver is down there, we're two animals, and he got on a run, and I let God do the rest."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",CHAD BAKER-MAZARA,"Coach really emphasized, especially on the big guys, whenever a shot goes up to go be there for the second challenge plunge, and he's been on Johni a little bit more about it, so I feel like today he was just being a beast down in the paint and he was in the right position at the right time and just got to be able to get the tip-in."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",CHAD BAKER-MAZARA,"I just bumped knees with one of the guys and probably hit like a bad spot. I always say my mama raised a warrior. If I'm not dead, I'm going out there on the court. Just basically had to soak it in and just come out there and put up a fight for the boys because I know they had my back and the coaching staff, so I've got to do the same for them."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"Yeah, I cramped up in my right leg. We're in a different environment a little bit. I played probably a couple extra minutes tonight, but I kind of trained myself to be conditioned and play through conditions like that. But just kind of cramped up, that's all."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,You played the whole game!
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",CHAD BAKER-MAZARA,"I mean, we was really kind of encouraging each other, just basically that we've been playing right, and knowing that they probably had the best half that they could ever have against us. Basically we were just talking to each other saying we're either going to come back out there and let them do the same thing or we're going to put a stop to it. I feel like especially Johni was delivering the message. He came out there and said the right things and got everybody fired up, so we came out there and did what we had to do."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"Credit to them. First half they probably went five minutes scoring every bucket. They had 49 points in the first half. But ultimately we pride ourselves on our defense, and at halftime the message was just like, we've got to get stops in order to win. We set a number, and in order for us to get that number, we had to get a lot of stops in a row. At the media time-out they said get five stops in a row. So I get three stops in a row, and then we just keep on piling on top of it and eventually they go on a scoring drive and we're able to get back in this game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"Just be unselfish, trust each other, get stops, run in transition, and set our defense on the defensive side."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JOHNI BROOME,"I was kind of -- I was never really worried about him. I know he's a fighter. At halftime I talked to him, and he said he was going back out there, and throughout the second half, he said, I got you. I knew he was coming to play, he was coming to bring it, and as you see, he's special. He came back in, hit a lot of big shots after not playing for a while, and that's the type of person he is. He's got our back because he knows we've got his."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Well, they obviously played brilliant basketball in the first half with unbelievable energy and effort. They outworked us. But we only turned the ball over twice in the second half. They turned people over one in four possessions, so they just weren't able to play with the same energy. We were able to run our offense and get that ball inside and mix up our inside out. Look it helped having -- Chad Baker was plus 13 in the game. We don't have him in the first half because of banging knees. So I just think the offense was in front of our bench. I thought in the first half we looked a little young, a little inexperienced. I thought we panicked offensively. But I give Iowa State all the credit for the way they played. That's what a top-10 team does. That's how you're supposed to play. But obviously give our kids credit for hanging in there and having the character to be able to withstand that run and not panic. And obviously starting off 15-2 changed the complexion of the game completely. They got 58 percent in the first half and 32 percent in the second half. Our second half defense, our taking care of the basketball, maybe a little deeper."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"Well, we talk about just one game at a time. It had been really hard to have lost that game as well as both teams played and as hard a. S both teams played and have to play tomorrow at 300. That would have been a really hard turnaround. 600 is going to be tough enough as it is after so much of an emotion. But we really talked about the opportunity to play three great teams three nights in a row and not really much about the invitational championship. We recognize the SEC has only won this thing twice in 40 years. Certainly now that we have advanced we're going to try to make history. But we just have a whole new scout against Dayton and North Carolina, a completely different team, but it was a good Iowa State team we beat tonight."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"I can't take credit for it. Chaney Johnson was in huge foul trouble, right, and that's one blessing, is that Chaney only played like 10 minutes because he got in enormous foul trouble, and he was playing well. So it was easy to go with Dylan, easy to go with the double bigs, and they got two monsters in there, too. I just thought Dylan being in there at the end of the game, it just makes us better defensively. He's one of the best defensive centers in college basketball. I thought Denver -- I was confident getting him the ball screen and getting him downhill. I thought that ball went in. It had to go in and out. I thought it was in. Then it comes out at the end and Johni is there to tip it back in. Really proud of these kids. I thought Chris Moore came in in the second half -- again, we were in some pretty good foul trouble, and Chris came in in the second half and really picked us up defensively. Doesn't score a bucket but has two assists, no turnovers, did a great job for us defensively. A lot of different guys were able to contribute out there. Tahaad had his moments, and we needed his speed and his quickness. I think the only thing that hopefully happens in that locker room is the guys gain confidence from the fact that there are enough pieces out there that it doesn't have to be just Johni, that several guys step up and make big plays, big shots."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",BRUCE PEARL,"I think these guys have embraced the fact that they love Auburn, truly love Auburn, and they're truly grateful for the support Auburn gets. If you take a look at those guys that are out there, Johni Broome was not recruited at a high major level and he's got a chance to be one of the best players in college basketball. He was a three-star. That kind of wears on you. He wears that. Chad Baker was in junior college. Denver Jones had to be in junior college and work his way up to Florida International. We may be a Power Five or Power Four, whatever, but we've got a lot of hardworking kids with some chips on their shoulders, and hopefully just taking advantage of the opportunity."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TJ OTZELBERGER,"Credit to Auburn, especially in the second half. They did a great job. They were the more physical team in the second half, and that showed up in a lot of areas, but specifically on the glass and their ability to get to the offensive glass. Certainly that last play is a microcosm of that. Credit to them. They played well. Thought our guys had tremendous fight in the first half and just didn't finish the way we would have liked, but we'll bounce back and be better for it."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",CURTIS JONES,"Yeah, I don't think we felt it as much at the end because we were kind of going basket for basket at the end. I think it more so started at the end of the second half when they went on their run, and we just can't let that happen."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",CURTIS JONES,"I've really got to go back and watch the game, but I know No. 10, he got hot. He hit a few threes. It seemed like they actually started hitting more threes if I can remember, and Broome got it going, too. That's pretty much what I remember."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TJ OTZELBERGER,"Yeah, Gilbert had played great. Wanted to get him in space going with his right hand, and tried to create contact and get in the paint and to the rim and just weren't fortunate enough -- it didn't go our way."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TJ OTZELBERGER,"Yeah, there's a lot of disappointment in the locker room after the game certainly, which you can imagine. We told our guys, use that feeling that you have now and you bottle it up and then you turn it into the positive. You come to a great tournament like this and you play these great programs, and you know that something like that can happen, and you need to learn from it. Areas we weren't as strong, need to make sure we address those, and we bounce back and we're better for it. I'm confident in our guys that we'll do that, and we'll use it to our benefit to be better."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TJ OTZELBERGER,"Yeah, they denied a lot more passes, they were a lot more physical guarding the ball, more aggressive with their ball screen coverage. Everything they did, they ramped up their intensity and their aggressiveness. Like Curtis mentioned, it was that start of the second half. When you're up the way we were you want to try to finish, and they came out with better energy and more aggressive and better ball pressure, and they put us on our heels."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TJ OTZELBERGER,"Yeah, we need to get him more involved. We need to get him more touches in areas where he can be effective, and certainly he was great in the first half, and we'll do a better job of doing that in the second half as we move forward."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,"We got the ball really well, and that kind of translated into the rest of our game. You know, guys, I'm not making fun of it, but to think we were up 13 in the first half going on a pretty good run at the end and we were 0 for 9 from the three. I'm telling you, today I thought we took some good ones. I'm going to just end it at that as far as our productivity, but we shot over 70 percent from the two. We're executing. We're getting our running game going. I thought both these guys played awfully well. Jase gave us a big lift early, slithering through those defenses. He has a knack for that. I think Szymon rebounded pretty well and guarded a guy who's pretty physical down there. We played well. That's a very well-coached team that's been rebounding the ball real well, and tonight they didn't rebound as well or we did. But we've got a lot of work cut out for us tomorrow when you look at the other disappointing stat, we had four turnovers in the first half. In the second half I thought we turned it over too much. Tomorrow we'll rely on that to score buckets."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JASE RICHARDSON,"I definitely felt 100 percent. Just getting work with Richie and then coach's plan, keeping it cool before we came out here and once we got out here, keep practicing on it, see how it felt before the game and keep getting treatment on it, so I definitely felt 100 percent."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JASE RICHARDSON,"I mean, when I come in the game, my main mindset is just try to help the team in any way I can, whether that's defensively or offensively, so just going in there and trying to make an impact on the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JASE RICHARDSON,It was definitely good to see a three go through during the game. It took a while with but we got it.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SZYMON ZAPALA,"Yeah, we really had to fight. We knew they were physical so we were trying to fight, bring it to them before, hit first, be the more physical one on the court."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SZYMON ZAPALA,"I think it's very important to me. It's a strictly effort related play, so that's all I can give to the team. I will never take away from their effort. Offensive rebounds is me showing that I care and I want to win. It's a winning play that I can do and help the team."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SZYMON ZAPALA,No comment.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JASE RICHARDSON,"It's super important. This has been a tournament pretty much all of us grew up watching, and then just the community would come out and watch these games, so it's definitely really important to get the whole community back out, and I'm glad to be back in Maui."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SZYMON ZAPALA,"It's amazing. I'm obviously from overseas, but I still know a lot about this tournament. It's very popular. Just seeing the community out, it's amazing."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, first, Tad to me is one of the better coaches. The job he's done developing some players the last couple years, three pros last year and every one of them weren't household names. So I think number one, I knew he was going to develop. I knew they run their offense really sharp. They missed some shots, too, like we did, but I thought defensively we did some things - give my staff credit - that we wanted to do. We took some chances on some things."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,"You know, I've always trusted Jase because even watching him in the summer a year ago, he rebounded better than you think he would. He passes the ball. He's got that -- he's got a very high, high, high basketball IWe call it catch and go, go and catch. He has the ability to see things before they happen, so he decides to catch the ball already on the run, and that helps him get in that paint area."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Yeah, Jeremy did. Jeremy is getting better, like I said. He is not where we need him to be because he's not -- there's times athletically that I just don't know if he trusts himself yet with his leg. We're kind of running into screens. That's what happened the first two plays of the second half. But I'm going to keep pushing him, and he keeps digging. Now, the beauty of it is he bounced back and really did a nice job pushing the ball and getting some things open. I thought Tre did a good job pushing the ball. But sometimes getting a little bit -- be quick but don't hurry. He was being quick and hurried. But I thought all three of those guys at times looked good. I thought Jeremy and Tre at times, just a little too quick and a little out of control. We'll work on that. We'll talk about it, and we'll get better."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, the best thing for me tonight was to turn around and see Magic there and know it wasn't a two-point game because the sweat that ran down my face that night against Chaminade, I had Jud who was probably looking down and Earvin, it was pretty cool. So it brought back some great memories. I talked to Dick Vitale a little bit by text today, and he gave one of those unbelievable lines after we beat Chaminade. The next day we were playing North Carolina, and when you win by two against Chaminade and I think North Carolina was ranked in the top five, and I think it was Bill Raftery came over before the game and said, Dick wants to talk to you. He's back in the studio. I said, I can't do that. We're going through warm-ups. He goes, come on, you're in Maui. You can do different things in Maui. So like an idiot I went over there and sat down and put on the headphones and Dick said, hey, Tom, congratulations on the first one. I said, thanks. Then they ran a stat that says Dean Smith, I want to say it was 853 wins, Tom Izzo wins, and he said, ""good luck tomorrow,"" and we were 20 down the next day quick. There were a lot of memories at this place for me, being here with Judd and being here my opening game of my career. And you're right, last year Rick Barnes, who's been here a lot, too, we decided to play this game and donate all the money to the people in Maui."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",I will say this,"I know it's something we don't talk about because it's hard on people, and I never, ever, ever like saying I know what you're going through when I haven't been through it. But I just want all the people in this community to know that we back in the home land there were devastated with them and support them and pray for them that things are going to get better and back to some form of normalcy. I think it will. I think this tournament helps that. I mean, this is a, as Szymon said, a worldwide tournament. It's not just a United States tournament. It is a special place for me, the number of times I've been here."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Well, Frankie, after a rough start I thought played well, too. He came back and started attacking the rim a little bit and gets to the free-throw line. But what he really did I thought was rebound the ball. He had six rebounds. I thought they were all important rebounds. He didn't turn the ball over. He made some big plays at the basket. Like all these guys, when they come in, it's going to take a while for them to feel comfortable in what they're doing. He and Szymon I thought both took a little step tonight."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,We moved up.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TOM IZZO,"You know, when you talk about it, and I don't mind talking about it here because I feel comfortable that the last week and a half we've been shooting it better, yet when you talk about it to your team, then does it become an albatross on you. So I talk to people that are more understanding in that area, and how do you deal with a team. I'm going to go back to being who I am and say, would you make the damn shot, please. You know, there's something to be said that we're averaging 80 points a game and not making any shots. Today we shot 70 something from the two. When we do start making shots, our defense has been better. I thought in some ways they shot 37-21, so if we can rely on our defense right now when that shot comes -- it's not going to happen all year. Do I have a reason why? I don't know, you tell me. Some people say, well, bad shots. I asked my staff, I asked a few people up there, we thought like 16 of the 21 were good shots and probably 12 of the 21 were great shots. I'm not greedy I just hope to make three or four of them and feel a little bit better and we'd be scoring 85 points a game. I can't harp on it. Is it a concern? Of course it's a concern. So our defense better knuckle down and get better, and we'd better find a way to start making some shots. It's going to happen, but I'm not trying to talk myself into it. It's going to happen. I look at Tre, 42 percent last year, Jaden, 36, 37 percent for his career. These aren't just sample sizes, these are large sample sizes. I've got faith, and in the meantime, you defend, you rebound and you run. Then by the theory -- Jud Heathcote said, your best offense is the missed shot. I've said, anyway you've got to win. We were 6-2 in the Big Ten at the time, and then I started worrying about the shot and we were 2-6 the second half. We're going to keep defending, keep rebounding. Earvin said it today in there, and just hope sooner or later they start falling."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",ALEX KARABAN,"We knew it was going to be a physical game. That was the game plan. We knew they wanted to make it physical. It wasn't surprising us that it was physical, we just had to match their toughness, and for most of the game we didn't. That's just on us."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",ALEX KARABAN,"It's on my shoulders completely, 100 percent my shoulders, how the team responds, how the team acts, how we watch film, how we do everything in general. It's all on me, and I've got to do that. I've got to continue to do a better job of that. It's something I'm going to address the team after, too, in the players' meeting just to make sure that we've got to wake up."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Just really, their style of defense is probably the toughest for us to play against, the switching, and really physical. They make your catches hard. They get into the dribbler with their hands. They're just super, super disruptive, and I thought we -- it disrupted our offense. But if you said to me I'd play an overtime game with these guys today and have 10 turnovers for the game, I would have taken that, especially with the extra four minutes. Most of our problems were in just one-on-one defense, and then the amount of times we put them or that they were put on the foul line."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Yeah, that was a joke. I mean, I just watched it. Listen, the game started for us, for me, with how physical Memphis is and how much -- so they're physical at the defensive end, and then at the offensive end they initiate a lot of contact and they were getting whistles early on in the game. It got off to a bad start when my medical trainer, who must have said something under his breath in a huddle, gets T'd up in the huddle in the first couple minutes or whatever that was in the game. A trainer who's just the nicest guy, very quiet guy. Might have muttered something under his breath in a normal situation. An official comes over to you and says, hey, Coach, tell that guy to shut up because I know they don't want to hear it from me. But that's commonly how that should have been handled, but I had a lot of issues with what went on out there in the game. That over-the-back call at that point of the game, there was no attempt to block out. There was a player on Memphis that made a half-assed effort to rebound that basketball, and Liam McNeeley high-pointed that rebound. For that call to be made at that point of the game was a complete joke, all right? And then for me, I don't know what happened. I might have lost my balance by the absurdity of the call or maybe I tripped. But if I made that call at that moment I would have ignored the fact that I was on my back, if I made that call. I would have ignored that. I would have ignored that. That was a major -- obviously a major -- how you could call that while that game was going on, the way that game was going on is just beyond me. But I know -- I've never seen the one ref before. I didn't even know he was a college ref. I'm familiar with the other two, so I'm not surprised."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Yeah, he's got to be smarter, but at that point, we were kind of dead in the water. We were down 12 or 13, and we looked lifeless. I started with riling the team up and creating some energy and some intensity and some fire, and the team followed suit. Samson was getting shoved. His jersey was ripped. He didn't get a foul called for him the entire game. He ended the game with his jersey ripped down the center, but they get him on every call. He's frustrated. That was crazy, man. Crazy."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Yeah, I think coming into it, I think when we realized we had such a low seed and obviously that's a heck of a first-round opponent, I think we're going to obviously have to bounce back and mentally regroup. We're not used to losing. But I think we are programmed with a lot of character, and we'll respond. This hurts. This sucks. We came here to win the championship. But Memphis is an excellent team, and we've got to respond the way UConn responds, no matter what time the game is. I played at 930 today. I don't know what time we play tomorrow. 700? I don't know what time we're getting up, once you go into the losers' bracket in the first game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",DAN HURLEY,"Yeah, he just looked a little skittish. He was great in that first half. I think like his first run he kind of looked like he was a little bit of out of rhythm, a little bit on his heels. We were down. He made a couple defensive mistakes. A couple of guys like -- with the way they approached offensively, they were just going at those match-ups. Some of it was -- it looked like he had lost a bit of a rhythm and skittish, and then some other guys just played a little better on the wing based on where we were in the game. But it was encouraging to see those two guys there. Thank you."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"What an unbelievable opportunity to be able to play the back to back national champions and then also win the game. It's so big for our city, for our school and for these young men so work so hard. We're riding them really tough because we have to get it right right now. We don't have the time to wait until conference starts because we have to do all our heavy lifting early and I put a ton of pressure on them to be better than where they should be quite now because they're still getting acclimated and getting to know each other. Just an unbelievable feeling to be sitting here, doing the hard work that we put in, it's paying off, and these guys are getting the rewards, so I'm thankful for that. Thank God for that opportunity."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"I mean, it felt good. I played these guys last year in New York, and I know the type of intensity that they were going to bring for the game, so I knew what to expect. But just being in that stretch and being in the flow, it felt good."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",COLBY ROGERS,"Yeah, man, hit I think it was a three right before that possession, so first thing I'm thinking, they give me a chance to shoot a three, I'm going to take it, and I just attacked, was aggressive, shot the three, and then just being late, obviously PJ fouled out, so it's next man up, and that's why our team is so dangerous because we're so talented and so deep that once PJ went out, I've got to step up, be more aggressive. 'Rese was already on fire, and then I just made shots late, and we got the win."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"I can say because it was on me. I turned my head. That's something we always say when you're playing shooters, you can't turn your head away from him. But I just told him you've got to go win the game now. It's a next-play mentality, so you've just got to keep it moving and try to win."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"It's intense, but when it comes down to it, you've got to make sure your head is on straight, don't lose track of what's going on like with the emotion, the scramble that the guys have. You've just got to make sure the guys are together so you can try to continue to win the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"Just trying to identify who we are. I think we work so hard that we're getting an opportunity to showcase that. We don't care what anybody on the outside is saying. We trust the group of guys that we've got, the coaching staff, the support staff, our players. Just establishing who we are. We've just got to keep working."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",COLBY ROGERS,"Yeah, to piggyback off what he said, I think internally we've always felt like we were capable to play with anybody, and we just tried to block out the outside know what I'm saying. Coach harps on that in practice all the time. We are going to have to take it. No body is going to give anything to us, so we came in with that mentality and we executed it today. The statement is just we kind of felt like that already. It's just a matter of just showing it to the world."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",COLBY ROGERS,"Yeah, it was unfortunate what happened with the fire and everything last year so we weren't able to have the tournament last year, but I think for us, we're just extremely grateful to be here this year, to be invited here and to play UConn the first game. We looked at it like this is an opportunity of a lifetime. This is why guys play basketball, why we be in the gym, why we wake up early, late hours, to have games like this and showcase our talent. We're extremely grateful for this opportunity."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"Yeah, we trust PJ. I know as soon as they got the tech, we sent PJ right to the line. We know what he's capable of. We're confident in him to shoot them. So yeah."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TYRESE HUNTER,"Just working with the training staff. I get drills and stuff, get out there, break a sweat, get shots up and stuff, so it's not like I'm totally sitting on the side, leg kicked up or something like that, but I'm still getting work in, making sure I'm staying in rhythm."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, with the magnitude of what's going on here at The Invitational, I can say yes. That was back to back national champions undefeated, first round of the Maui tournament."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"I'm actually not taking any of this for granted because I know how hard it is to win and especially beat a team like that, but I'm so excited for our university and the city more so than anything because we need more positivity. We need more of -- this city, the entire city is happy right now, and that makes me happy, so that's the magnitude it had on this win."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, they're a well-oiled machine just watching them, man. They're just like clockwork because the times we did allow them to get into their stuff, they made those shots. They're really efficient and they're really sharp."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, it happens all the time. Dain reacted to Moussa being pushed down if that's what you were talking about. I was a little upset with Dain because we had a technical right there because Moussa got pushed down by Johnson because he fouled out. But I'm never going to be a guy that doesn't allow a teammate to take up for his teammates. So double foul, their ball, let's go get a stop and let's get back in it. But I just saw that the team unified more at that moment versus being apart because he could have stayed where he was, not cared, but he cared enough to come to Moussa's defense, and I liked that, as well."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Yeah, we were actually Lahaina Strong today, to be very honest. That just bleeds right into what we talked about before we came over here. Went through the horrible wildfires and it was devastating, but they grew together. They bonded. I said, we need to use that type of strength for ourselves going into this fabulous tournament, and to be able to give them this game today, the very first game at 930, it's amazing to jump start this thing off. So thankful, so blessed to be here to get the invitation to come, and I love everything about Maui, man. I'm glad that it's recovering now."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"I just want our guards to be able to handle the fundamentals of the game when it comes to that. You can't get into a trap space. You've got to get out of trap spaces, got to use your ball fakes to shift the defense and then get through it and advance the ball up the floor. We do that, but in the heat of the battle against the No. 2 team in the country, the nervous energy hits, so we learned from that, so the best experience is going through it. That's the best teacher is the experience. For us, the next time somebody does that, we'll be more prepared and ready in real time. Because it's easy to do 5 on 0."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",PENNY HARDAWAY,"Not really, man. I just know that everybody has their opinion about what's going on, and some of it was warranted. I can't run away from what's going on. I know that it's a job that needs to -- we want to win in this city. We want to win. I'm no different from anyone else. So when I get that criticism, sometimes when it gets personal, it hurts because I'm trying to fight for this city and the team, but I understand everyone has a job to do, and they have their opinion."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,I think I give Carolina credit. They played 40 minutes. Always going to be a 40-minute game. We understood that. I thought our guys battled. We gave ourselves a chance. Proud of the effort. This is a heck of a field. We have a quick turnaround. We need to get prepared to play one of the best teams in the country again tomorrow.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Questions for the players.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",NATE SANTOS,"What we're capable of, that we can fight, we can go together. Like coach said, quick turnaround. We got to put together a full 40 minutes. Obviously a great effort but a disappointing loss."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",NATE SANTOS,"Yeah, I think credit to them. They went on a roll. They punched back. I think us, we got to keep our composure, just continue to go together. You have to give them credit. They fought back. Ended up going their way."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thanks, Nate. Questions for Coach Grant."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"Yeah, I thought their pressure, the defensive pressure, kind of sped us up. We kind of lost our composure there, made some questionable decisions. They're great in transition. They allowed them to get out in transition. They were able to get a lot of three-point plays. Transition, the free-throw line, those things I really thought was the difference."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"I'm going to try to get them out of here as quickly as I can, get our scouting report, get them ready for tomorrow."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"No, we'll prepare the same way."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",ANTHONY GRANT,"It's a hard loss. We felt like we had chances to win the game. So we got to be able to be resilient and put our focus on the next game. That's what I'm trying to do right now. We can't really relive what happened tonight. Didn't go our way. Our guys fought. We gave it everything we had. Give Carolina credit. They were able to win the game. So now we got to get prepared for another tough, really challenging game tomorrow."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Thank you.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Questions for the guys.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",DRAKE POWELL,"Just when you have a very talented player like RJ on your team, I feel like he draws so much attention, so it's just important to always stay ready. I feel like he can trade for others very well. Yeah, just set my feet, knocked it down. It was a good experience."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SETH TRIMBLE,"It was electric. It was like a high school-type atmosphere, something we all kind of miss. It was a super loud gym. We had I don't know however many percent of the gym packed out with our fans. Just have to us behind our back making the comeback was amazing. We knew we were super capable of it. We knew we were going to do it. Just to do it in this type of atmosphere, how loud it was, it was super fun."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",RJ DAVIS,"There was a lot of motivation going into halftime for myself and Seth. We were kind of like the voice in terms of just trying to get guys going and just build our spirit. Obviously we went down big in the first half. Wasn't the first half we like to play. Myself and Seth, we just told them, like, We got to stop shooting ourselves in the foot. We always putting ourselves in this positions and got to climb our way back into games. If we can just put together the second half like we did tonight in the first half for a full 40 minutes, we'll be more than fine. I feel like in the second half, the way we battled, competed, we just chipped away possession by possession. I think that's when we knew we would come back from this game. That was from everyone, not just one person. It was a collective contribution from Drake hitting the corner three, Seth fastbreak layups, Elliot making nice passes to J Wash. J Wash talking on the defensive end on the switches. Just those little plays and details make big things happen, and that's why we was able to come out with the win."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SETH TRIMBLE,"We'll get back tonight, eat, start prep right away. Watch our personnel, watch what they did today, watch their plays in the year. Auburn is a really good team. They're very competitive. They're very physical. I mean, I think they're a top five team. We have our hands full. It's going to be a good game. We know we have to prep ourselves mentally because we got to put two halves together tomorrow. We can't sustain this 15-point comeback every second half. Prepping ourselves that way."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",RJ DAVIS,"I would just say it's heart and not giving up and wanting to compete and wanting to win. The starting five and the bench. We went into that locker room, obviously some explicit words being said. That was in a way of trying to get everybody to compete hard irrelevant. They were kicking our butts on both ends of the floor. Out hustling us, out toughing us. We didn't allow that no more in the second half. Like you said, we kind of did that against Kansas. It's not sustainable for the whole year because it's a long year and teams are really good. We can't keep coming out flat in the first half and then trying to put a comeback in the second half. I'm really proud of the group effort that we had tonight. Just shows how really talented and gifted this team is. But we just got to do a better job of putting both halves together."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SETH TRIMBLE,"One more thing. I don't know if we made a promise to ourselves, but we really bet on ourselves that we weren't going to let this be like Kansas, end up like Kansas, losing the last 30 seconds of the game. We said it at halftime, We're not going to let this be Kansas. We set it about three seconds left to go. We kept reiterating it."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",RJ DAVIS,Not Coach Davis smiling.
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",RJ DAVIS,"Well, I remember Elliot had the ball. We called five up. J Wash was setting the screen. I kind of lifted up. I realized I brought my defender towards Elliot as I was driving. I spaced out, did a little backdoor cut. As I was driving I saw the big pull in. I was able to get around the big. Their defense shifted and rotated. I found Drake in the corner. Trusted him. I knew he was going to knock it down. That was a big-time shot from him. That's what I saw. That was the play that happened."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",SETH TRIMBLE,"We got to be maybe a little bit more timid on defense, on the defensive end. It kind of allows us to play smarter. Honestly it kind of helps us. It has its cons as well. We've been here before. We've all played in indiscernible before. This wasn't my first time it all wasn't his. So we were used to it. Helped us play smarter. We can't play as aggressive. You kind of want to play more aggressive coming back when you're down 21. We were able to do it. It worked out."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thanks, guys. Questions for Coach Davis."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Drake is gifted athletically. He's elite defensively on and off the ball. I thought his length, athleticism, and pressure on the ball when we were switching caused them problems. Then also his ability to rebound the basketball. I thought he stepped upped when he got into the game. To be able to have the confidence, to be able to knock down that three in the corner to put us up by one was huge. Really happy and really proud of Drake tonight."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"I've said to this group that the growth and the step that this team needs to take is to getting to that level that allowed us to get back into the game, to start the game that way and to stay there. Yes, it gave us and it gave them confidence on what we were able to do on the road at Kansas, to be able to give them an example of there's a lot of time to be able to come back. It's not a situation where we have to come back from 21 in two possessions. Just a possession at a time. Actually the first four minutes of the second half, they came to the bench and I told them, They're not making comeback plays. I said, You're just not. You're not getting the rebounds. You're not getting defensive stops. You're not getting through screens. You're not getting loose balls. You're not taking the ball strong to the hoop. You're not dunking when you get around the basket. Just not just making those plays. I said, If you would change that, this game would flip."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"I find myself everywhere. I'm very proud of how they reacted, how they responded. I'm really happy for them. I love those kids. The way they persevered through adversity out there on the floor out there and was able to turn this around, as I said before, against a very good Dayton team, I'm really proud of them. I really am. I'm also keeping it real with them, as well. There's areas of consistency and growth that we need to move forward with. Those are things that we'll talk about. We talked about after the game. Things that we'll talk about tonight and tomorrow in preparation on playing Auburn."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Prior to this game, I think somebody told me this, I don't know, but somebody told me that we were No. 1 in the country in terms of not turning the ball over. Okay, we flipped it in the first half. How many? We had 12 turnovers for 19 points? I don't know how many. That was uncharacteristic for us. We talk about all the time defense. They shot 51 in the first half. We talk about rebounding. They were beating us on the boards. We talk about taking care of the basketball. In the second half, how many turnovers did they have? We had two turnovers."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Three. Then we ended up out-rebounding them. We held them from 51 in the first half to 35 in the second half. You check those three boxes, you're going to be in every game. We were able to do that in the second half."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Well, they always show up. It doesn't matter if it's Maui or Chapel Hill or on the road. Our fans are fantastic. The encouragement they gave our team when we were down and we were coming back, giving us that encouragement really helped. Having that home-court advantage from the crowd is something that we feed off on. I'm very thankful and appreciative of the Carolina fans and the way they have showed up for us here in Maui but also in Chapel Hill and everywhere else."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",HUBERT DAVIS,"Well, I don't know if you were here, but I told them at I think the 16-minute mark in the second half, I said, You guys aren't making comeback plays. You're not making the plays to be able to come back. You're just not. You're not getting the rebounds. You're not getting the stops. You're not getting the loose balls, finishing around the basket. You're not setting the screens, running the plays right. You're just not. That switched after the 16-minute mark. We just started chipping away. We do have that experience of not only coming back when we played Kansas, but how we did it. It was just possession by possession. I think that gave our guys confidence that we could still do it against a really good Dayton team."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thanks, coach."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Hats off to Michigan State. We prepared for a fight. They didn't do anything that we didn't expect. I thought Coach Rohn did a great job with the scouting report and the game plan. Unfortunately we didn't show up -- we showed up the first 10 minutes we played hard and we made shots, but then we lost this game on every front, offensively, defensively, rebounding the ball, all the things that we work on, and they were better than us in every phase of the game. I can't think of one thing -- we made four threes and they made two. But they scored 50 points in the paint, and that was a team we knew was struggling from three coming in here. They're still struggling from three, but we gave them 50 points in the paint, and that was the No. 1 piece of the game plan was to protect the paint and make them make some shots. So transition defense, box outs, you name it, bad shot selection on the offensive end. We just got beat by a better team, and it's unfortunate."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"We knew he wanted his left hand and just didn't really cut it off. He's a real good driver when he gets that way. He can shoot a little pull-up. He has a lot of things to his bag, but overall it's just when he gets downhill to his left hand, he's hard to stop."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TREVOR BASKIN,"I'd say it was definitely something just lacking on our end. I couldn't say what exact thing it was. I think we got a little too drive happy, and myself included, I think we got a little fixated on trying to attack the rim and over-dribbled a little bit. But we did a poor job of adjusting and getting back to what we did the first 10 minutes of the game."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",JULIAN HAMMOND III,"You know, it's a quick turnaround, so we're going to go back, do what we've got to do to get our bodies right, our minds right, scout team, all that. And just be ready to go."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TREVOR BASKIN,"Yeah, there's no time to really have a hangover. You're playing a two-time national champion the next day. You can't wallow in self-pity for two days or else you'll get your ass kicked again. We've really got to learn from what we did today and try to fix those issues and give it our best tomorrow."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, look, my assistant coaches, they do a great job scouting. I've got a great staff, I really do. I've got a lot of confidence in them. I'm going to watch this film. We had dinner at 700 tonight. I want to spend about a 30-minute film session talking about today's game and what we did, what we didn't do, and show them. There's no teacher like film other than experience. Then we'll eat and then we'll turn our attention to UConn and get ready. It's a quick turnaround for both of us. They played the first game. They get a few more hours' rest. But it's who's going to be hungrier tomorrow. That's what I'll find out about our team. One thing I know about Coach Hurley and the way he's wired is I know they'll be ready, and they're a little angry. Who's going to be angrier, UConn or Colorado? That's what we'll find out at 1030 tomorrow morning."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, number one, it's great, and I'm happy for the residents of Maui and specifically Lahaina because of what they went through. We're very cognizant of that and appreciative to be back and maybe help get things back to normal, whatever that is, for the people that were affected by the wildfires. So our hearts go out to them for sure. I think it's a great step in that direction. But in terms of this tournament, we knew coming over here, this is a loaded field, and we knew no matter what happened today, you're going to play a really good team tomorrow. No matter what happens tomorrow, we're going to play a really good team on Wednesday. In terms of preparation, there's no teacher like experience. We had six days to prepare for Michigan State. Like I said, they didn't do anything we didn't expect. We knew they were going to crash the boards. We knew they were going to get out and run on makes and misses. We knew they wanted to get downhill and get the ball in the paint. We just couldn't do anything to stop them. We made some shots the first 10 minutes of the game to keep us in it, and then our offense went stagnant."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"I know Matt guarding the ball defensively has been an issue for us. Even in our four games before this first high major team. So guarding the ball defensively. I don't know what the final was. I know they had eight points at halftime from us just guarding the ball in the first half. I don't know what it was for the game. That's part of it. Taking care of the ball, I mentioned that before the game. Did a better job of that. Four turnovers in the first half, but we had five in the first five minutes of the second half, which allowed them to expand the lead rather than us to contract it. There's a lot of things for us to work on. The one thing I learned, I think, and it was pretty obvious if you watched us tonight, Elijah Malone is a heck of a weapon for us. We've got to use him more. We've got other guys that think they're shooters, and I call those guys shot takers, and we need to find some shot makers. The first thing we've got to do is take good shots, and we did a poor job of that, I thought, when we started struggling. Trevor mentioned dribbling the ball. We've got a lot of guys that dribble the ball, not too many guys that drive the ball. Michigan State has got guys that drive the ball. There's a difference between dribbling and driving. We dribble it, they drive it. Then we've got to make good decisions when we do drive it. You know, toughness, and they made some really good verticality plays in the second half at the rim I thought were really good defensive efforts by Michigan State, and on the other end, they go through us like a hot knife through butter and there's nobody at the rim going vertical. That's all toughness. That's all that is. If we don't figure that out, we've got a long season ahead of us."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, it's soft. It's soft. Again, that gets back to that toughness factor. The number one thing on the board defensively before they took the floor, it's a short warmup, but they come in and you say, okay, you give them one or two, maybe three things defensively we've got to do, the number one thing was keep the ball out of the paint, whether it was with guarding the ball and gap help, whether it's post defense, you name it, transition defense. We weren't able to do it. They got the ball in the paint whenever they wanted and in different ways. It's just -- to me it's a matter of toughness. That's really -- because with Michigan State, if you are not tough, you have no chance to beat them. And we weren't very tough tonight, and we had no chance to beat them."
2024 - MAUI INVITATIONAL PRESENTED BY NOVAVAX,"November 25, 2024",TAD BOYLE,"Well, he's a part of it for sure because he's very dynamic. He comes off the bench, and sometimes I don't think our players understand how good a players come off the bench in college basketball, especially from programs like Michigan State. He's a kid that's extremely athletic. He finished in the lane. He finished at the rim. He's a shot maker. That's why he was 6 for 8. Now, they're struggling from three, but they got the ball in the paint and they made plays. They finished at the rim, and we didn't finish at the rim. It gets back to toughness. The one thing I know about Coach Izzo is he prides himself and his program on toughness, as we do, and that's what's so disappointing to me about our performance tonight is that toughness factor. I keep going back to it. But Jase Richardson is a hell of a player, and they've got really good guards."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"To win a lot of games, you've got to win the games that you're supposed to win. You've got to win the games where you play great, but you've got to somehow figure out how to win the games where you're not your best. We weren't, but they weren't either. It was kind of a brick contest there at the first half and much of the second, but we hung in there. Hunt did some good things. We missed five layups, I think, the first half. Zeke never got going. AJ was in foul trouble. But I did think we rebounded the ball better than I probably thought we would because that to me could be an Achilles heel. I thought our transition defense was actually better except for late on a couple of plays, and I thought we did, when the score was about tied with about 12 left, I thought we did play well down the stretch. So there were a lot of good things, but it's nice to have a big guy you can throw it to and get a basket."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"KJ hasn't done anything since Friday. We didn't know he'd play. He shot today and said he was fine, but you could tell he wasn't himself tonight. I actually thought, since Michigan State played two bigs, we'd be better off playing those two together. And we did, we practiced it for 20 minutes one day, so we should be pretty adept at doing it. I actually thought they did pretty well together."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"That's not how we practiced at all. We haven't practiced on trying to get Hunter the ball. We practiced on playing four around one, playing him on the perimeter a ton, and utilizing him to help space the floor. We practice that way all year long. I will tell you this, today wasn't an intense pressurized game from an intensity standpoint, but it's a different pressure for some guys playing here for the first time, just like in the Carolina game. It's different. We need to get through some stuff. Fortunately, we've been able to get through it with a couple of wins. But I don't see any negatives to what's transpired at all so far."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"I didn't expect anything like a water bath after the game, and I certainly -- it was great that Frank and Rio were there. But that stuff, that really doesn't mean a lot to me. It's nice. I guess I'd rather have it than not have it. That to me doesn't really drive me by any way, shape, or form. I'd much rather figure out a way to just get better through it. I've always thought, if you take care of your business, all those things just take care of themselves at the end. Let's not get this twisted. Phog Allen coached there for 39 years. The building is named after him. He recruited Wilt. He got Allen Fieldhouse built. He won a National Championship in '52. He recruited and coached the two best big men in the world. There's a lot of things that he did in his time that goes unnoticed because it wasn't near as popular as what it is now and as recognizable. So I'm not getting too carried away with it."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"I think to C.J., that's what C.J. was saying. He's got to score the ball. He's got to shoot it. He's got to score. AJ and Rylan have to do the same thing. Diggy can be a guy to make a couple of 3s a game. I thought Zeke's floor game was really good. I thought the made the one bad play late. But other than that, it was good."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"I would say probably not. He doesn't like Michigan State a lot. In large part just because he went to Michigan, and I'm sure they're trained to dislike the other at a pretty significant level. I think Hunter's playing better than I expected because, as you guys saw against Carolina, he should have had 30, and his timing is all off. He just hadn't practiced much. When he gets his rhythm and gets in shape, he'll do better things. But I did think he was really good. One thing he's got to start doing is making free-throws, though. But Hunter is playing at a pretty high level."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"I think so. With Rylan, though, Rylan made the biggest shot in the game, and he'd been sitting on the bench, and he was cold. When he doesn't think and just shoots it, he's pretty good. I got him a little screwed up where he's thinking too much. Hopefully we can get him out of that. I still think our team isn't a square peg in a round hole. It's more like an octagon type piece that's round but it just won't fit in the round circle. It's close, but it just doesn't yet."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"React instead of think. I honestly think when you think, when you have to think and you're an athlete, you're slow, and you're always hesitant. There's no reaction to it right now. It's like they're trying to process things because they want to -- they're great kids and they want to do what you want them to do, but doing what you want them to do requires a thought process now instead of reaction."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,I think that's part of it with both of them but probably more so with AJ. I do think that's it.
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",BILL SELF,"Every coach in America, if they told you the truth, wishes they could take somebody's place here. Even though there's other big games before this game now, the way the schedule falls, it's still the -- basically, the ceremonial tip-off to the season. So, yeah, we're proud to be a part of it, and we want to continue to play in it as long as they have it. Certainly -- Atlanta is a little bit harder place for our people, I think. This was by far the smallest contingent of Kansas people that I could ever remember at this thing. Usually it will be us or Kentucky pulling in the most, but not this one. I don't really know the reason why, but I think our fan base playing in Chicago or the Garden gets them a little bit more juiced to actually be a part of it. But it's a great event. We're proud to be a part of it."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"It's hard to figure out what to say. I think Bill said it best to me after Neither one of us shot it very well. If I would have told you that we were going to do the job on Adams that we did and Harris and Mayo, I thought we had a good chance to win. But our key guys didn't play very well either, and some of that's got to be their defense. I thought we both had some open shots we all missed. But I was really disappointed to get outrebounded because that's what we do here, and we start the game with five turnovers, I think, in the first five minutes. Then we settle down at the six-minute mark, it's a two, three-point game, and then they went on a little spree. They're a good team. I don't think they're anywhere near what they're going to be. I think they're going to be really good. Their shooters didn't shoot very well either in Griffen, Mayo, and Harris, Storr. I mean, even Coit, I've seen him shoot the ball really well. Dickinson played well, give him credit. What I really liked about Mayo -- I don't know him personally. I know he's a shooter, but when you shoot it like he does and he goes 2 for 8, 0 for 3, and honestly not very good, but he gets 10 rebounds and 6 assists, that's a credit to Bill, his staff, and how they get a kid who's not playing well to do other things to help his team win, and I thought they did a phenomenal job of that. I give Bill a lot of credit for that. I did not get that out of a couple of my guys. They didn't shoot it well, they didn't rebound it well, and they didn't guard it well. All in all, I think there will be some disappointing things watching the film. We missed a dunk, just can't do that in big games. But there's some positives that come out of this. We played a very good team. We're ahead in the game most of the way, and now we've got to figure out how to make some shots."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Yeah, it really hurt us. I think a couple of times Jeremy overpenetrated. A couple of times Tre really struggled and Jaden. We took a couple of bad ones the second half. The first half, I thought just about every shot we took was pretty good. Second half I think we -- we showed like a team -- although I was playing those young guys, and deservedly so. I thought Jase played very well. I thought Jaxon did some good things at times and a couple of them not. But we need Tre and Jaden to play better, to be honest with you. And Book. Book missed wide open shot after shot, which I don't care about, I really don't. But then not guarding and not rebounding, 14 minutes to get one rebound, he's just got to rebound better. He's got to do something. Hopefully we'll learn something from Mayo because I thought that was pretty impressive stats to be that bad for a good shooter and yet do those many good things to help his team win. In fact, maybe will his team to win. It was really impressive."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"It's interesting you say that. We started out 1 for 22, 1 for 11, and I think 4 for 15 last year. In Jaden's case, he's a 37 percent career shooter, and he has struggled. But I think he struggled tonight for some poor shots. I thought he rushed some. He's got to realize now he's a marked guy and he's going to have to do more to get open. They did a good job on him. I have confidence. We held them to 30 points the first half. They only shot 40 and 29, and I think that's a pretty talented team. But I think Bill agrees with me and I agree with him, offensively we both sucked, to put it bluntly. We've got to both get better, and we've got to find a couple guys. Might start putting Kur in there some, get some shooting."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"We weren't going to double Dickinson. Not many people I've seen have doubled Dickinson. He made some shots early. We were supposed to dig a little bit more on him. If you double Dickinson -- we did everything we wanted to do in the scouting report. We wanted to keep the ball out of KJ Adams' hands at the 3-point line. He's lethal. He's the Draymond Green in college now. He's the best screener, roller, passer. He passes like Magic, he rolls like Draymond and screens like Draymond. Those are the Michigan State guys that I can compare him to. I told him at the end, watching him on film, one of my favorite players -- tough, unselfish. So we do a helluva job on him, and partly because of the game plan we had to not double. Did a good job on Mayo and Harris and Griffen. Dickinson, of course, hurt us, but you pick your poison sometimes. Give him credit. He made some of those shots, made that big 3. We still had our chances to win the game. I'm not sure I'd change that. I would like to make maybe just two more 3s. Not be greedy or selfish, just maybe 2 out of 100."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"That's where I said, somewhere I'm going to look at the film, and I'm going to see some good news, but I'm also going to see some bad news. I didn't think we cut out. They hurt us on the offensive boards. Whatchamacallit was pretty effective the first half. I'll just say Flory since I recruited him. Never knew how to say his name then, still don't know how to say it. Helluva kid, good person. He was effective even though he only had one rebound. Like I said, I'm not disappointed in the way we played them. I'm disappointed in how we shot and the turnovers that led to -- sometimes a bad shot is a turnover, and they usually lead to breakaways. In that stretch, they got a couple of 3-point plays, one from the 3 and one on a layup because of our poor decisions on taking a couple of bad shots."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Listen, you'd all want Jaden Akins to marry your daughter. You'd all want Jaden Akins to represent your program. He's an incredible student, incredible kid, incredible worker. He'll be in there working morning, noon, and night. Do I think he's pressing, feeling the senioritis that you do? I think he is."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Xavier tonight, we didn't go back with him not because he missed shots, we didn't go back with him because of the lineups they had. They were going small, and he struggles to guard. So we went small some too with both Frankie and Coen. We got some things out of it, and Book will be fine. He's making progress. If he makes a couple of those 3s, we're all sitting there happy with him and he probably plays a little more because he had, I think, wide open 3s. I don't think he had one that wasn't wide open. I think he had three and one possessions. It will get better."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,I didn't hear the first part.
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",TOM IZZO,"Body language for Book isn't one of his strong suits, but he's not going against you. He just doesn't have great body language. I would say that Book's worked his way through a lot of things. If you watched him in practice, he's a lot better than he was. He's gained 20 pounds. He's not where everybody wants him to be yet. It wasn't his fault that somebody projected him certain ways. He's a good player, and he's a really talented kid, and he's going to get there. It's just the process is taking a little longer, and games like tonight -- I say that, and they have fourth and fifth year guys that struggle too. We forget he's in his sixth game as a sophomore. So I'm not worried about that. I'm disappointed that I think we let our offense affect our defense a little bit in the second half. But Kansas has got a very good team. Bill's a phenomenal coach. When you win 13 championships like he has in the league and that consistency. He's got a good team. I don't think -- I wasn't in the press conference, but we've all got to do what we've got to do because you guys sometimes kill our guys and rightfully so sometimes, but sometimes we'll make it better than it will be and sometimes worse. I don't think either one of us were happy on the court. The only thing that was happy for Bill and I is we were both miserable, and that was a good thing. I told him, we'll talk during the week. We don't play each other again, thank God. If we do, it will be late, late, late, and that will be cool. We're going to get better. If you can shoot that poorly and be in a game against a good team, there's something positive there, and we're going to try to build on it."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,It was a very big game for me. It was a very big game. Definitely a big game.
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"I was saying they was too small. They can't guard me, and I was putting emphasis on it."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"My players that put me -- my teammates were putting me in really good spots where I saw a couple go through the net and they just kept feeding me. Guys like Zeke Mayo, Juan, they were throwing a lot of help and kind of giving me easy shots to really get my rhythm going. Once I got my rhythm going, I started feeling it out there."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"Obviously I went to Michigan. I graduated from Michigan. I still got that rivalry inside of me. Like I said earlier, it was a big game."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"I thought it was really fun. Flory is a freak athlete, so athletic, so energetic. And playing with him makes it really easy because, if I'm able to set a screen and roll and the guy doesn't step up, I can get him a free run in the lane. Or if they step up, I've just got to throw it anywhere near the backboard and he's going to go get it. He's a really great defender, really great teammate. I think he definitely helps us when he's on the floor. Whenever he's in the game, he makes plays."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"It's really special. He's never going to admit it. He's always going to try to downplay it and give off the credit, but he's the best coach in Kansas basketball history. We're super special and fortunate to be playing for him. I know the fans realize that he's the best coach to come through here. We're just, like Juan said, trying to win more basketball games for him, try to make him even better than he is."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"When you're looking at it, it's impossible to be better than 3-0 right now for us. Can't be better than 3-0. We beat a top ten team in the country. We beat a Michigan State team that probably will end up in the top 25. Obviously they're not there right now, but they're a really good team. Playing a Coach Izzo team, he's going to have them prepared for the No. 1 team in the country. We knew coming in we weren't going to be able to blow them out. They play really hard. They execute their stuff. He's a Hall of Fame coach too. He's going to get his guys ready. It was a great win for us on a neutral site. Like I said earlier, you can't be better than 3-0 right now."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"Even though we didn't shoot it that well, our best shooter, he didn't make a three, but he had 10 boards and 7 assists. He might have not had his best shooting day, but he impacted the game, probably the most impact on the team. He made all the winning plays out there for us, made some big drives down late that help helped us win. Obviously Rylan Griffen, we don't win without that 3 in the corner he hit. Very unconscious, very unconscious. AJ Storr is still getting it. Did he play great today, no, but he's still playing. It's super early for him. It was a big adjustment for him, but he's doing it. Like really great attitude, great attitude."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"I mean, Coach Self isn't going to take anything but your best. If you're not giving your best, he's going to let you know every time. Some guys aren't used to that. I don't know where people came from, but it could be a big adjustment for guys coming in their first year. These guys are taking it really well. Attitudes have been great from the newcomers, even the freshmen. Attitudes have been great so far. They're willing to learn, hungry to learn. We're just trying to help them as much as we can as teammates."
2024 - STATE FARM CHAMPIONS CLASSIC: MICHIGAN STATE VS KANSAS,"November 12, 2024",HUNTER DICKINSON,"I played them four times, so they have doubled me in the past. So I was expecting that. We prepared for that. So I was a little surprised when they didn't, but I was thankful that they didn't."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",THE MODERATOR,Good evening and welcome to the NCAA women's Final Four press conference. Joining us are the 2024 national champion South Carolina Gamecocks.
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Just really wanted to say congratulations to Iowa and Caitlin for making it back to the national championship game. Obviously they're a formidable opponent that took everything that we had to win the basketball game. But just don't want to not utilize this opportunity to thank Caitlin for what she's done for women's basketball. Her shoulders were heavy and getting a lot of eyeballs on our game. And sometimes as a young person, it can be a bit much, but I thought she handled it with class. I hope that every step of the ladder of success that she goes, she's able to elevate whatever room she's in. I'm super excited to share this moment with our team. They are incredible human beings and young people who trusted, believed and figured out a way to help each other, learn and grow, and ultimately become champions."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",RAVEN JOHNSON,"Don't let her score. I was ready for the moment. And I take defense very hard, like I take it to heart. I studied her moves, and I was ready. I had confidence this year. I was telling myself last year's not going to happen again."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",RAVEN JOHNSON,"It means a lot to do it with this group of girls. If you guys would have seen us, just the stuff we went through in the summer and the hard work we put in, we deserve this honestly. Coach, she gives us so much leeway. She let us be loose. She just let us be who we are. It's just so much stuff that we go through. Credit to the Freshies. I gave my net to Aaliyah Boston when I was interviewing with her. It started with her. She gave this leadership role, and she instilled this leadership role last year. There's no better way you can learn than from her."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,I think it's really important. I feel like they do a great job on defense. And just by seeing how hard they play makes us want to play defense harder.
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"I thought they had the hardest job tonight, but it was also team defense. It took a lot of effort to guard Caitlin. And she did her thing, and we did ours. Just to have these elite defenders on our team, it makes me want to play defense. It makes me want to play for them even harder. It's just amazing when you have good defenders like them. It's not only them, it's the whole team. So I'm just really proud of them for what they did tonight. They did awesome. They did a great job."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",RAVEN JOHNSON,"It means a lot to make history, be one of the teams to make history, especially with a young group. You guys just don't know what this team goes through, what this team do. It's daycare, yeah, it is daycare. But at the same time, when we step on the court, we're ready to play."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"Yeah, it just means so much. We've come a long way. It's been a long journey. We've trusted each other so much over the season. We have so much confidence with each other, so much love. We're going to sound like a broken record, but it's love throughout this whole program, throughout this whole team. We genuinely love to be with each other. We genuinely want to see everyone succeed. It's been a great journey, and to cap it off with a perfect season, it's just a blessing. And all glory to God for that."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"She means a lot to me. I feel like, since the first day I got to South Carolina, she's been working so hard to get me ready and prepared for moments like this. I'm just so thankful to have her as a coach. She's like an inspiration for me and a lot of young girls out there. I'm just so thankful to have her as a coach. She's the best in the business, you already know."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I think just trying to get the post-ups and my teammates finding me and giving me the ball, even though I didn't shoot really good tonight. I think just by -- we just move the ball really good, and they were able to find me while I was open."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I got a lot of treatment between yesterday and today. But I don't think it really affected me today. I was just able to go out there and play. I wanted to play for this team, play for our coaches. And I just wanted to go out there and play today."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",RAVEN JOHNSON,"I did want to see them in the national championship this year because what happened last year. It was apology to my teammates, my coaches and myself. And I just feel like, like I said, it was a revenge tour. And there's no better way than to play them in the championship and beat them."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",RAVEN JOHNSON,"This team, we're going to be good. Coach Staley, we have the best coach, what, in the country, in the nation, in the whole wide world? It's no telling what she's going to add to the pieces that's already here. I just say be on the lookout."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It was amazing. I feel like I just wanted to get out there in this tournament and just play really well for my teammates, for my coaches, and to win the championship. So I think that's what I did."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",RAVEN JOHNSON,"The GOAT, you mean the Dawn Staley? It means a lot just to play -- just to learn from her. She's like a mom. I mean, I don't know, I go to her about everything. I could joke around with her. I could do anything, just anything. She's like a mom, like a home away from home. It's a home-away-from-home feeling. There's no better way to have a coach like her and be so comfortable around her. And I take pride in what she do for us, on and off the court, not just basketball."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I agree with Raven. I feel like, especially me, I'm international, and I don't have my family here. She's just like a family for me, a family away from home. And I'm just so thankful to have her as a coach crying."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"Man, she's so important to have in people's lives. She's amazing. God has put her in my life, and she's impacted it so much, not only me, but my family. She changes lives for the better. I wish you guys could experience that and just how much she's helped me as a player and as a woman. And she's just amazing, man. It's a blessing. Just playing for her is so much fun. People just love playing for her. People would run through brick walls for her. To be able to have a coach like that, it's unimagined. We're all just really blessed to have someone like her in our corner. She just impacted our lives for the better."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"Man, they're our difference maker. This whole season, we've depended on them so much, they're our depth. They've done so much for this team. A lot of people sleep on them. But they could start on any team in this country, but they decided to sacrifice that and play for this team and win a national championship, which we did today. Big shout out to them. They did their big thing today on such a big stage. And I'm really proud of them. Their confidence has grown so much throughout this season. I'm just really proud of them for performing how they did today and helping us get this dub."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",RAVEN JOHNSON,"Going off what Te-Hina said, I'm going to give Tessa Johnson her flowers. When you talk about a freshman, it's just the stuff that she does. She's always ready for the moments. When her number is called, she's always ready. Every shot she puts up, it goes in. Just what Tessa does. And on the defensive end, she takes pride in defense. If you talk to her, she's like a sponge. She's gets in the gym, she works on her shot every day. She wants to learn. She wants to grow."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"Tessa was due for a breakout game. What to do better than on a national stage? She's trusted her process here. She's trusted her journey. And for her to do that on such a big stage, I'm so proud of her. Her confidence has grown so much. I'm just really excited for her future. She's going to be a great Gamecock. She's got a bright future ahead of her. But she's just got to keep trusting the process and being who she is. She's just an amazing little girl."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I agree with that. I'm just so proud of Tessa. She's been working so hard since the beginning of this season. I'm so happy for her because she went out there and she did a big one. And I know this is going to boost her confidence a lot. She's just doing a great job. She always works so hard for moments like this, and I'm so proud of her."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thank you, ladies. Congratulations on a tremendous season."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Well, it was emotional for me because of how it ended last year. I'll leave that there. And I was emotional at the beginning of the game because I didn't want what happened last year to happen this year. So I was handling things in real time, not afterwards. I'm going to move to handling things in real time and not having to wait until there's an ending that shouldn't be. I was like that throughout the entire season, but for this one I wasn't going to allow what I felt happened to us last year to happen this year. So I had a little bit of PTSD, and I addressed it in real time. I mean, it's heavy, it's heavy. You carry the burden of every single one of your players, all the coaches and staff members that put so much into our team. And it's a heavy load to be undefeated, to finish the job. And you get emotional because you just want that for them, and you're happy that you're able to -- because only one team wins the national championship. And when you win a national championship, there's more trust that's built that you can take into the summer workouts and the postseason workouts and in the fall and into another season. There are so many conversations you have with parents, with any significant person in our players' lives, that the rigors of the season, you just have to face that music with them. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes it's challenging. Sometimes it's just a really hard conversation. Then once you win, this is the reason why. It builds trust amongst everybody that's involved in our players' lives. And I'm just super happy for our staff. They work really hard. They are incredible basketball -- like, I think they're savants. I think they are always looking for ways in which to get our players better in a way that they can handle it, not in the way we see it, because the way we see it is probably -- the way we would handle it would be difficult for them to actually learn and apply and execute in a basketball sense. So we're able to just kind of speak their vernacular and them actually deliver. So all of that makes it emotional for me."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Well, it means that we have quietly done things, in my opinion, the right way. We find the right pieces to help us. We really do things the right way. We're very disciplined in how we approach basketball. I am one that, I'm forever indebted to basketball, so I'm always going to take care of it. I'm always going to make sure that our players are respectful. I'm always going to make sure that they know the history of our game. I want to make sure they are always respectful to our opponents. And when you do it that way, in return, you have success. You have success in the wins column and very little disappointment in the loss column. I don't think that's talked about enough, what we've been able to do, and I don't know why. And I really don't care why. We're going to keep doing what we're doing the right way, whether we are the popular or unpopular successful programs in the country. We're going to keep doing it that way."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"To have a roster that goes nine, 10 deep is -- it's a privilege, it really is. But it has to be developed slowly and the right way. Like, there's a lot of trust that has to be built because there's some games that some of them won't play a whole lot, especially the people that's coming off the bench. Chloe Kitts went up and down and all around, and then finally she settled in today to have a really good game. But she had to come off the bench at times because of -- not what she wasn't doing, but it was more about what somebody was doing and doing well. And that can shake your confidence. But at the same time, you have to let her know the way you build trust in our coaching staff, it's the same way your competitor is building trust. I think MiLaysia Fulwiley has been very patient with us to be able to have a household name coming off the bench, playing maybe, probably less than 20 minutes a game, where she could have gone anywhere else in the country and they'd have given her the ball time and time again. But winning a national championship will allow us and that relationship to continue to grow because I know she really wanted this. And I would imagine that, come as early as next year, she's going to want to be a starter, she's going to want to play more minutes, she's going to want a lot of different things because she got the big one. So now she'll maybe want to concentrate on some individual awards. And I appreciate her sacrifice. So it's everybody. It's just Sania Feagin who, she's a junior, and she's probably started less than 10 times, but she came up crucial this game, like really. I know she's probably wanted to play a lot more throughout the season. But I hold her to her standard, I hold her to her personal and individual standard to sometimes that equates to six minutes, or five minutes or less. And it doesn't feel good, but in order for us to do what we do today means she's got to meet her standard. And we don't sacrifice that. So it's built through trusting the process. It's built through really high-level communication, some that they may not like all the time, but it's truth. We also want them to talk to us about what they're feeling and seeing so we can understand them and how they operate in that space. So we don't want to mess anything up, but we also want to give them an opportunity to tell us what they're thinking and how they're processing information or if we're giving them the right information. That's a long winded answer. Sorry."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Well, I know we do our part. I know we do our part. I know we do our part in making sure we try to, as much as possible, shout it to the top of our lungs what our game is all about, and all of the story lines and all the talent and all the coaches and all the talent that's actually telling the stories. I have to continue to shout out Elle Duncan and Draya Carter and Chiney and Leah and Carolyn Peck, they've done a tremendous job. We have to find a way for them to tell our stories during the off-season because you have to continue to build on what we've captured."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"What does it mean to me? I just want our game to grow. I don't care if it's us. I don't care if it's Caitlin. I don't care if it's JuJu or Hannah. I just want our game to grow, no matter who it is. Because there's a lot of people that are out there growing our game, a lot of programs out there growing our game. We need to continue to uplift them as well as we take our game to the next level."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"For Raven, I think it was psychologically helpful to be able to play Iowa and Caitlin, to just release. As a player, you want to release certain things that have held you captive. And I do think the waving off in the Final Four last year held her captive, to where usually you just quietly do things and go about your business. Raven's got the bullhorn saying this is revenge tour, this is this, this is that. Then for her to actually lock in and play Caitlin the way we needed her to play her -- we knew she was going to get her points. We wanted her to get her points in an inefficient way. Like I look at the stat sheet, it's beautiful. It's like, if she scores -- if she's shooting 50 percent, we lose the basketball game. So I think it's pretty cool that she was able to just kind of check off a goal and move forward. And hopefully there will be another test to challenge her in a way that will continue to elevate her."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Aside from their talent, a prerequisite of us actually recruiting a young lady is their relationship with their parents because if they respect their parents, they're going to respect us. If they don't respect their parents, we don't have a shot. So that's what we look at a lot. Fortunately, we have some really great parents who are -- they're in their daughter's lives every single day, so they're in our lives every single day. And we don't mind because all of us want the same thing. We want them to be incredibly successful. I'm fortunate as a coach to have that relationship with our parents."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"I mean, it's incredibly satisfying. You have a team full of players who probably felt the lead dwindle to a point where someone like Caitlin, like a five-point lead versus Iowa is nothing. Like, they don't flinch when it comes to getting the lead into a -- come on, you're all writers, help me out -- that's dwindled to the point that it's a one- or two-possession game."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Good evening and welcome to the NCAA women's Final Four press conference. Joining us on stage are the Iowa Hawkeyes. Coach, if you'd like to provide a brief opening statement."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Just want to congratulate South Carolina. That is a tremendous basketball team. Coach Staley obviously, congratulations to them. I'm proud of my team, though. Finishing national runner-up two years in a row is an amazing feat. Nobody thought we were going to be here at the beginning of the year, so that makes it pretty special. Always saying good-bye to your seniors is really, really tough. And every time you see a season end it's another chapter closed, and that's tough. But I know we're going to look back on this and be very, very proud of the effort we gave this year."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,I think any time someone like Coach Staley is able to recognize you and what you did for the game is obviously pretty special. Obviously she's someone I respect so much. I respect what she's done for South Carolina. I respect what she did as a player for our game. Any time you can get the praises of her is pretty special. So it means a lot.
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, it's certainly been a special year. To be honest, after last year I was kind of, like, how do we top doing what we did last year? Somehow, some way, every single person in our locker room believed. To be honest, this year was probably more special than last year. The teams we had to go through to get to this point, we won the Big Ten Tournament. We lost two players that were three-year starters for our program, and to be back in this position and come out here and battle -- I mean, South Carolina is so good. There's only so much you can do. Cardoso has 17 rebounds. They have 51 as a team. We have 29. Hard to win a basketball game like that. You've basically got to shoot perfect at that point. I'm just proud of our group. We never backed down, and we gave it everything we've got. For me, just the emotions will probably hit me over the next couple days. I don't have much time to sit around and sulk and be upset. I don't think that's what I'm about either. Yeah, I'm sad we lost this game, but I'm also so proud of myself, I'm so proud of my teammates, I'm so proud of this program. There's a lot to be proud of. But there's going to be tears. It is sad this is all over, and this is the last time I'm going to put on an Iowa jersey. I think just reflecting back and soaking in everything that I was able to do because basically anybody other than me and Coach Bluder never thought this was possible."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I've been 110 percent focused on finishing my career here. That's been my full focus. That's been my driving force, and I think that's what's allowed me to play such great basketball through the month of March and April and through the end of our season, but really all year long. It was never the decision of whether I was going pro or whether I was staying at Iowa, never was something I stressed on too much. I knew it was something that would become clear to me over time. I think for me I know what's next is soon. But at the same time, I'm not blind to the fact that I need to enjoy this, I need to soak this in and enjoy these last few moments with my teammates because these are some of my best friends. They'll be my best friends for the rest of my life, and that's what matters to me the most."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is it's really hard to win these things. I think I probably know that better than most people by now. To be so close twice, it definitely hurts, but at the same time, we were right there. We battled. We took down some really great teams to get back to this point. It's something that's really hard to do."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is, for us, this team came along at a really good time, whether it was social media, whether it was NIL, whether it was our games being nationally televised. We've played on Fox, NBC, CBS, ESPN -- you go down the list, and we've been on every national television channel. I think that's been one of the biggest things that has helped us. I think, no matter what sport it is, give then the same opportunities, believe in them the same, invest in them the same, and things are really going to thrive. You see it with other sports, and I'm a big fan of other sports. Like I try to support as much as I can, and I think that's the biggest thing is continue to invest your time, money and resources there, and continue to show up for those people and give them the opportunities. I think that's what's going to help drive women's sports forward in the future."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KATE MARTIN,"I don't know if you can really describe and put it into words this legacy. Honestly, I just hope we've brought a lot of people joy and we've brought a lot of people together. I hear all the time about how many friends people have made in the stands just watching our games. We sold out every single home game this year at Carver. And everywhere we go, we have fans lining up wanting Caitlin's autograph, our autograph. More than anything, our legacy is what we've brought to the state of Iowa, I think, and all the joy and the fun. It's pretty cool to be coached by Coach Bluder and the culture she's built at Iowa. I think just watching us, you can see the joy that we have. I think that's the main thing for our legacy."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, I would agree. I think this group has gone about it in the right way in every single thing that we've done in every phase of our life. I think that's what you can be the most proud of. We truly have each other's back. Maybe we weren't always the most skilled. Maybe we weren't always the tallest. Maybe we weren't always the fastest, but we just believed. We knew we could be in these moments. We trusted one another. That took a couple of years to get to that point. There's been so many great Iowa women's basketball players to come before us and allow this program to be really, really good when Kate and I and everyone else stepped on campus. And I feel like we took it to a whole nother level. I feel like our program is in good hands moving forward. I think more than anything people will probably remember our two Final Fours and things like that. But people aren't going to remember every single win or every single loss. I think they're just going to remember the moments that they shared at one of our games or watching on TV or how excited their young daughter or son got about watching women's basketball. I think that's pretty cool. Those are the things that mean the most to me when people come up to me and -- I don't really get offended when people say I never watched women's basketball before. I think, one, you're a little late to the party, yes. But, two, that's cool. We're changing the game. We're attracting more people to it. But at the same time, those little things are, I think, the moments that we'll remember forever."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"They're a really good team. We knew they were going to go on runs. By no means, when we started off as hot as we did, did we think we'd be able to hold that lead. That's just what teams do. There's some crazy statistics where South Carolina just outscores everybody in the second half by a ton of points every single game. To me, I'm just proud of our resiliency. We go into the fourth quarter, I think we cut it to five. And we just weren't able to come up with a few stops and a few baskets. That speaks to our team. That's the story it's been all year long. My whole entire career, we never give up. We just keep fighting. Their runs are kind of daggers, especially when they keep making pull-up jump shots. That's what we are going to give up. Sometimes you live with that and you're going to live with them out-rebounding you. There's only so much you can do for someone who's 6'7. Hannah was doing her best to box her out. She's a really great player, going to be a really great pro."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KATE MARTIN,"I don't think I can fully grasp the whole entire concept of being a part of that right now. I think once I'm older and I can reflect back on this time, I think I'll appreciate it way more. Just like we've said before, seeing little girls and little boys look up to us, want our autograph, enjoy watching women's basketball, that is just something so cool and so special. I idolized Iowa women's basketball, but it wasn't like it is now. It's just super cool to be a part of that. I think forever we'll be known, like I said, our legacy as a team that's really kind of changed women's basketball in a sense. I mean, there's other teams too. But it's just really cool to be associated with that, and I feel super grateful."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I would say the same. I think there's obviously so many amazing people that have come before us and give us this opportunity. I think, to attract so many people to watching women's basketball is so special. And the way people have showed up consistently throughout my career, I was going through some old pictures last night and just how things have changed since my freshman year and my sophomore year, it was so incredible. Time goes so fast. It's crazy. I can't believe this is my last career game. There's just so much to be proud of. I think people didn't love us for our wins. I think they loved us for the way we carried ourselves every single day, for the way we played for one another, the joy we played with, the passion we played with, the competitive spirit we had, the way we high-fived and celebrated our teammates' success. That's the reason people loved turning on Iowa women's basketball."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I would say I think the biggest thing is this is what I kind of said about my entire career is nobody really believed other than myself. I think confidence. I think as a young girl, just have confidence, a young boy, have confidence in yourself and confidence in whatever you want to be. I think that was the thing that my parents instilled in me from a young age. They never told me no. They told me no about other things, but not in what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be and the goals I wanted to chase after. I would say that's the biggest thing. You've got to say it. You've got to work for it. You've got to earn it. You don't ever want anything to be given to you. That's what I'm most proud of throughout my career, I've worked really hard to be in this moment. That's where my confidence comes from. That's the piece of advice I would give to the younger generation."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",KATE MARTIN,"Very well said. I used to sleep with an Iowa women's basketball poster on my ceiling. So to be in this position and be with Coach Bluder and make it to back-to-back national championships, I just feel super grateful. It's because I worked really hard, and I dreamed big. I'm not some All-American, five-star recruit out of high school. I never was. And people believed in me, I believed in myself, and here I am. So if I can do it, so can you."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thank you very much, Kate and Caitlin, and congratulations on a tremendous season."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Yeah, it's interesting that those games were streamed. I think we were playing at, like, 300 in the afternoon during COVID and things like that. So really not giving anybody an opportunity to watch our games. Caitlin has certainly been a tremendous star for our game, but there are so many stars in our game. We have, many, many. So we're just going to latch onto that next one next year. And there's lots of them. There's not just one. Even this year, there were so many. That's what makes her getting the player of the year award so special because it wasn't a runaway. It was a really, really hard decision because there's so many good players out there. I'm hoping with our success, I think success breeds success. Definitely I feel recruiting going forward. We've opened up our geographic footprint. And I think that's going to bode well for Iowa in the future."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"She has raised the excitement of our sport. There's no doubt. Just because she does things in a different way than anybody else can do. Plus she has all the intangibles. She's a great student. She's a great role model. She does everything -- she loves being that role model. I really think that, when she came in as a freshman and she said, we're going to the Final Four, a lot of people laughed at her and maybe even laughed at her for coming to Iowa, quite honestly. But she believed, we believed, and she got everybody else in that locker room to believe. And that is not an easy thing to do. So her just belief in everybody around her, it just grew and grew. You could say the same thing about this year, quite honestly. I don't know if I answered your question completely, but I think that she has done amazing things to grow our game and doing it the right way."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I hope it means a lot. I'm so proud to be a part of the Big Ten Conference. It's a great conference. We go against super competition every single night, great coaches, great athletes. And it prepares us for this. It prepares us for being on the biggest stage."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"That was a huge advantage because I think they played nine people in double figures. We had six. Just to have those extra fouls and extra legs. They didn't have to play too hard. Even the other night, they were resting people the other night. One thing that we've always been able to do is really push the ball and really run. We did score pretty well. We scored 20 more points than other people do against South Carolina, so we did score pretty well. But, yeah, to be able to have all those fresh legs on Caitlin was really tough. And not only their depth, their height. I'm not just talking about their centers. They're really pretty big at every position, which makes it hard. They could recover really well when we had 3s."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Obviously, Dawn Staley is the leader of women's basketball right now. She's our Olympic coach. She is the person that we are all looking up to. And she's somebody that, when she says something like that to a player, it should make them feel really good. I'm thrilled that she acknowledged Caitlin and her greatness, I really am. I think that Caitlin is going to continue to have this kind of impact in the WNBA. Indiana is doing well with their ticket sales. I know Las Vegas had to move to a different, bigger arena when Indiana comes to town. So those are all really good signs that women's basketball is in a good spot."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Well, people did know about her. She was the fourth best player coming out of the country. People did know about her obviously. We really had to work hard to get her, to keep her in the state. This group -- I really hope that I haven't changed a lot, to be quite honest. I changed in how I had to coach Caitlin because there was that line you had to walk between discipline and don't put out the fire. So there was that line. But honestly I don't think I've changed as a person. The values that I have now are the values that I've always had. The things that we really try to build as a team with trust and caring for each other, I've always tried to coach that way."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Hannah Stuelke, first of all, was a power forward up until about the beginning of November. So she really has adapted to her position. She didn't really want to be a center, but we convinced her that she needed that. And if it was best for the team, she would do it. She obviously has improved her game so much this year and used -- and everybody focused on she's not tall enough, she's not tall enough. You have other assets, right? You've got speed. You've got agility. Use those assets. And she has done it. Even though she wasn't playing the position she really desired and wanted to play, didn't matter. She came and gave it everything she could all day. We talked about her growth as a young woman, as far as mentally and confidence-wise. And that gives me a lot of joy when I see my women just growing in that area of their lives because I know that's going to last forever."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"It kind of makes me a double loser right now, quite honestly. It's tough. But I know how hard it is to get here too. I say that tongue in cheek because I know it is really, really difficult to get to a Final Four. For us to be national runner-ups two years in a row, I'm never going to apologize. So many people last year, oh, you'll do it next time, like it was terrible we didn't win the national championship. So many people said that to me. I'm like, darn, you guys, we're national runner-ups. That's pretty good too. So I'm never going to apologize for finishing second in the country. But it sure would be nice to win one."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"It's so empowering being around these women. I mean, to be around women that are driven every single day, that come to work positive and believing in themselves and each other, it is so empowering. I wish everybody's workplace could be like mine is, and the world would be a whole lot better place. But I think you are well on your way, Lily. I really do. I think you're going to be in that driver's seat real soon. You're amazing."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 7, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"It's kind of hard to process right now. I pray that our team will still get the fan support even when Caitlin leaves. I mean, we have five seniors leaving. So, yeah, we're going to be young. We're going to have some growing pains next year. But I hope that people respect the way that we play, the way that we do things, and they're going to want to support this young group of Hawkeyes next year, just as much as they have after the success we've had the last couple of years. So I just hope it maintains."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Good morning, welcome to the NCAA women's Final Four pre-national championship press conference featuring the South Carolina Gamecocks. We'll open up for questions with Coach Dawn Staley."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,I haven't watched last year's game. So the focus is on this team this year.
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"As a coach, I've had a pretty successful playing career, and once I left playing, I totally locked into coaching and being the best coach that I could be. It's super fulfilling to know that you can be a part of your players' lives, where they can fulfill imagined dreams and unimagined dreams. To see her in such -- I mean, she was playing in that game last year during this time -- and to have her flip it and be really good at it, it does the heart well. It fills my heart with so much joy. And she's really good at it. Some people say you can't be really good at two things. She's really good at two things. And I'm probably missing out on some other stuff that she's really great at as well. I'm giving you what I see and what you all see. She's going to be a star in this space."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"No, not really. When I look at basketball, I don't look at wins and losses. I look at how things are executed and allow the wins or the losses to take care of themselves. And as much as you bring up like an undefeated season, it doesn't feel like it because, I mean, we've played some bad basketball that made it feel like we lost. So it's those kinds of moments that keep us just locked into the task at hand of playing -- just trying to play great basketball, just trying to make great decisions out there to increase our chances of winning. It's really hard to believe that we're undefeated because I don't feel it. As a coaching staff, we have to pinch ourselves to even know that's true because deep down we see what our shortcomings are every single day."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Coach Stringer has been doing this for a long time. She was the example of what black coaches had, in looking at her journey, looking at her success, and looking at her courage, looking at all the things that she had to endure. She often calls. I talked to Coach Stringer probably two or three weeks ago. She called and just kind of congratulated us on the season we're having and to pour into us. She doesn't do it every day, but every so often when you get a call from a legendary coach, it gives you inspiration, it gives you stamina, it gives you what you need in that moment to have the strength to continue on with whatever challenges you're faced with. And she's always welcoming. If I have something to run by her, always. And always appreciative that I would use her as a resource. So it is that. She doesn't overwhelm you with things. She allows you the space to grow and to learn and to be there when you're at a crossroads to give you some wisdom."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Raven is finding herself on and off the court. She was one that didn't really talk a whole lot. You really couldn't see her personality. I do think, with the successes that she's been having on the court, she feels a lot more comfortable to share who she is, the fun loving. Raven's never had a bad day. How you see her play in a game is exactly what she brings to the court every single day. We say, okay, we're going to go 50 percent, she doesn't know 50 percent. She goes all out. So the journey of her having a voice, and no matter what that voice is, she's in such a learning phase of her life. She's open to learning -- not just basketball, but history. She's learning what she likes. She's learning a pathway of who she wants to be. And she's unafraid to go out there to say or do some things that, it will rock you a little bit, it will make you laugh, but it is who she's becoming. I love that about young people, to be unafraid to say what you want to say, what's on your heart to say. And it might be the wrong thing, but we've all been 18- to 22-year-olds. And we all have said some things that may not be the right thing. You live, you learn. I just hope that, throughout every young person's journey in this space to be able to express themselves and to not be vilified because even to this day we say things that can be deemed hurtful to other people, but it's not in that context. We need to look at people for their entire journey. If you can speak to someone's entire journey, you'll find that your knee-jerk reaction to what someone says isn't that deep at all, isn't that hurtful at all. It's just a perspective."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"No, I haven't always been that way, good Lord. I've had to lay down my religion a few times in the half-court -- I mean, halftime. But you approach each team in how they receive information. You deliver it in how they receive it because ultimately you just want them to get the message. Sometimes we as coaches mess up the message with how angry we can get, how competitive we can get in those moments. It was really no yelling, no screaming. You could see clearly what we needed to do to make the adjustments. It was just to simplify, just to pass to the open person. Don't hold the ball more than a second. Like have a plan when you catch the ball. If you want to score, have a plan. If you don't, pass the ball. Give it to Kamilla, give her an easy look, knock down a 3 here or there when you're open -- very, very simple. I think, by us coming out and making our first shot, it ignited what we were able to do on the defensive side of the basketball. We definitely had to clean up our ball-screen defense. We definitely had to apply a lot more pressure to the initiator of their offense. Once that happened, we found ourselves getting a little bit some easy buckets and getting out in transition and just putting NC State back on their heels a little bit, because they had us on our heels for two quarters."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Raven came from a great high school program, a great AAU program. I know that a lot of people want her to be a scoring point guard. She wasn't developed to be a scoring point guard. She was developed to be a consummate point guard that this is what you do. When it's time to pass, it's time to pass. When it's time to score, it's time to score. I think sometimes, whether it's social media, whether it's family members that want her to take that next jump. And she will. But her mentality has always been to pass first. That is her passion. That is her development. Then you have to teach her opportunities for her to score. That's where we are now. Because of what happened last year in the Final Four, it kind of expedited it a little bit because she has the urge now, like she wants to break out into being an opportunistic scorer. So I think by the time she ends her career, she's going to have the best of both worlds when it comes to that."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"No, she didn't tell me that. I think, when you're embarrassed, I think when we lost, like all of that, it makes you question. The game will do that to you. Anything that you love and you're passionate about will make you question it at some point. That is what you need for your breakthrough. And if you don't have enough just power, strength, your breakthrough will never happen. Raven is going to be a great player because she was able to break through that moment and catapult her into that next level now. She's going to be tested somewhere again along the line. We all are given life tests. You either pass them and move on to the next test, or you keep retaking them. Think about it. Think about everybody's life. What is the very thing that you can't get over? You keep seeing it time and time again. Then when you hurdle that, you move on to the next one. So I think Raven is at that place. She's young. It's a little bit harder for us as grown-ups, she's a little bit younger, the more young you are, hopefully the more people in your life can help you navigate through that. And you're not as stubborn to give up on something. Raven's in a good place. She's been given what she's needed to learn in a good moment, in a good young moment in her career that's helped her grow."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"I think it's great. It's a monumental game for our game. We're very fortunate to be a part of it. We get to witness firsthand the legacy of Caitlin Clark. You watch her. You prep for her. You can't help but to really love how she dissects the game. You love how she executes. I mean, it's simple. Her game is simple and yet powerful. How do you defend fundamental basketball with offense with fundamental defense? You can't. She's going to win every time. So you've got to show her different looks in order for her to not settle in and picking you apart. But we also have to play our side of the ball. We got to defend. We got to put some points on the scoreboard. I do think it will be a -- I hope it's the most watched game. I've been a part of witnessing from the outside looking into the most watched game. It's going to be fun to hopefully be a part of it, like in the mix of things. I hope that everybody gets exactly what they want out of it. And I just hope the viewers, the people in attendance will take tomorrow's moment and carry it to the rest of the history of our sport. Hopefully we can keep the eyeballs and demand where it needs to be."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Damn, you got deep on me, didn't you? I'm on the opinion of, if you're a woman, you should play. If you consider yourself a woman and you want to play sports or vice versa, you should be able to play. That's my opinion."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"That's the question you want to ask, I'll give you that. Yes, yes. So now the barnstormer people are going to flood my timeline and be a distraction to me on one of the biggest days of our game, and I'm okay with that. I really am."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"That's what it's all about. That's why you play a sport. Obviously you play a sport to win, but the relationships and experiences that you have with your sisters is what will carry you. The fact that L.A. would take her to church and to find answers to why things have happened the way they have. Because that's what she was searching for, she was searching for an answer -- why. Why was I put in this situation? Why did this happen? That's the best place for her to find her answers. I actually knew about that. I actually knew about because it became part of our conversations. Raven is very impressionable, so I'm glad she chose the right person to help her navigate through a space that was really hard for her."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"I think with Elle, Draya, Chiney and now Aaliyah Carolyn Peck, Black women holding it down, holding it down, taking it to another level. And it's quite remarkable. And for Aaliyah to be a part of that, she knows. She knows now what she's reaching for because she's seeing some of the best analysts that I've ever been around. It's not -- they're giving credit where credit is due with every single team that is participating here at the Final Four. That's not always the case. They're breaking it down to its simplest form where everybody that is tuned in can really understand our game. They appear on other talk shows. They are lifting our game up in spaces that are just male dominant. I think some of these male talk shows don't really know about the fabric of our game. They don't know the inner workings. They don't even know how to break the game down. They're just going off of probably what someone is telling them to say or social media."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"They're pretty motivated. We just had our film session this morning, and they're all locked in. It wasn't daycare this morning. It was -- I don't know if it's just because they just woke up, but they're locked in. Like you ask them questions, they really understand what we need to do to win, which is pretty cool to see that dynamic from this team. But I would say ever since we got into the NCAA Tournament, there's a lot more focus than the regular season, meaning when it's time to prep. There's a lot more writing notes. There's a lot more recall. So they're more locked in, and hopefully they can get it done."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Great question. At this point, rest is equally as important as working out. We won't do anything. We're going to walk through the hour that we get here, and then I think there's an open practice that our players will probably get juiced up for, and they'll move a little bit quicker than what we're going to do in our closed practice. Tough game. At this point, like when we were -- when we won in, I think 2017, we just did a walk-through. We just did a walk-through, as somebody told me -- no, I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that -- 2022, walk-through, walk-through. They're locked in. And it's not very much prep time because we get an hour on the court. We get a 50-minute open practice. You can't really do anything. So it's more about film sessions and talking to individual players about what we need them to -- how we need to play and execute."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",DAWN STALEY,"Stuelke is -- it's a matchup that we've got to win. Like, we've got to win that one. First you've got to run in transition. I mean, she gets out, her and Martin, they get out. They get out. They are determined. It was, you know, I will run for a layup. That's the mentality. Then what she's able to do in the half-court, I mean, she puts you back on your heels. We certainly have to use our length. We've got to make her play through us, and she doesn't mind that at all. On the flip side of that, we have to make her guard us. She's going to have to guard not one, not two, not three, four. We've got four or five legitimate post players that she's going to see and have to guard, and they all are different. Iowa's a challenge. They're playing their best basketball. They're playing inspired. They're playing like they want to win a national championship. So are we. I think it's a crash course of who's going to have the better run, who's going to be able to execute when it's time to execute."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",THE MODERATOR,We'll open up the floor for South Carolina senior guard Te-Hina Paopao.
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"She means so much. Her presence inside has done so much for us. Seeing her growth over the season has been so much fun to watch and experience with her. Coming into the summer, she wasn't really looking to dominate her kill like she is now. It's a great sight to see. I'm really excited for her journey. We've got one more. So I know she's going to dominate tomorrow. We're really excited for her."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"She's our beautiful Brazilian girl. She's just amazing to be around. She's light. She's always funny, always energetic, always smiling. She's just a loving person. She's an amazing person, and I'm really fortunate to have someone like her in my corner and someone on our team. She just keeps everything light but also tells us to lock in. Hearing her voice and being a leader is something that I've always admired."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"I did know a little bit about her, but I knew what type of person she was and what kind of player she was."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"Yeah, I love seeing her growth. I think everyone on our team has been growing so much. Seeing her confidence grow as a person and a player and being who she is and being outgoing. She's just so much fun to be with and so much love from her. Seeing her growth is just an amazing thing. She's been in the gym before and after practice. She's been working on her shot. She's been growing as a player. Just her mindset, it's been different. Her mentality, her revenge season, it's something like that for her. It's been amazing to watch. She's been killing it ever since, and she's just got to keep riding that wave. I'm always going to be there for her. Just seeing her, it's an amazing feeling. I'm really excited for her journey to keep improving and just keep putting people in the right spots and doing what she does."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"The talks weren't even about the Final Four and the natty. The talk was you're going to come in here and compete. You're going to need us, and I'm going to need them. So it's been a great marriage between the two, an amazing journey, an amazing ride. The fact we made it here with our team, it's been amazing. I'm kind of shocked, but at the same time we were prepared for this, we got ready for this. And to know that we play in the championship game tomorrow, it's a great feeling. But at the same time, we're also locked in. I'm just really blessed and grateful for the opportunity to be here, for her to give me the opportunity. It's surreal, and we're really excited to get it going tomorrow."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"Man, it means so much. I've had family members come to games, but nothing like this. I got, like, 20 members here from all over the States. Just to know that my performance in basketball brings families together and just bringing people together from afar, it's an amazing feeling. I really appreciate their support and their love, and hopefully we can get a ring tomorrow and just share it amongst my families. It's just an amazing feeling to know that family is going to support me no matter what."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"Man, that's just my family. They're very welcoming. It's part of our Polynesian culture to welcome people and just to open up with open arms and join us with love and unity. It's just something that I've cherished. It's something that I've spoken about here at South Carolina, how it feels like a family, and how we open up with open arms and with love. Just how this program has brought so much attention to my family. Just being able to share that light with them, it's amazing."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"It helps a lot, especially with her and Ashlyn. But just to be able to apply pressure on the perimeter knowing that we have help side and 6'7"", it's great. Like I said, our team is about team defense, and just being able to have a 6'7"" post player block everything that comes her way, it's an amazing feeling. I'm hoping she'll get some blocks tomorrow as well."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"It's an amazing feeling. Everything is sunk in already. Everything is sunk in, all the emotions and everything else. I know we're not done yet. We've got one job to do. We've got to take care of business tomorrow. It's just an amazing feeling. Everyone has been telling me it's a special feeling, especially championship day. I'm just really blessed to be here. Without God, I wouldn't be here, without his grace and mercy. I just want to thank him for that. It's been a long journey. To know that we're here finally, it's an amazing feeling, and I'm definitely going to soak in everything, whether we win or lose, because at the end of the day, we've still got a life to live. So I'm just really blessed, and I've been loving every part of it."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",TE-HINA PAOPAO,"I'm going to have to say when I got here to South Carolina. The journey has been so long, and just to know that I'm playing for the National Championship tomorrow, it's a great blessing. Just realizing how far I've came and how much God has given me the ability to keep playing this game and keep giving me that confidence. It's something that I hold dear to heart. And knowing we've got one more game tomorrow -- it's been, like I said, a long journey, and to know that journey is coming to fruition, it's a blessing, man. I just can't even put into words how far this journey has gotten me, and I'm just blessed to be here."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"At this time, we'll open it up for senior guard Caitlin Clark."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing for myself is at the beginning of my career, I thought everything I did had to be perfect, whether it was -- a lot of it always relied on my shooting. I think over the course of my career I've been the one that's been able to realize I'm not going to be perfect every game. There's going to be good games. There's going to be bad games. But I still have to be somebody that my team can lean on in those moments. And I think also accepting I don't have to score every single point for my team to win. That's exactly what you saw last night. I didn't shoot the ball great. I made some shots there at the end. I thought Nika played tremendous defense, picked me up 94 feet. That's something that South Carolina is going to do too. In general, we went in the locker room at halftime, nobody was flustered. I wasn't frustrated with myself. I just continued to chip away and make some big shots in the fourth quarter and set my teammates up for success. I thought Hannah Stuelke played really good. I was trying to get her the ball as much as I could. I thought Kate came up with big plays. I definitely think that's the biggest way I've matured and grown over the course of my four years is just never get rattled by things that don't go your way. Basketball isn't a perfect game. That's what's going to happen. That's what honestly I'm the most proud of."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think to bring back a national title to the University of Iowa would be super special. Obviously it's special in its own regard, making back-to-back national title games. I know everybody would come up to me before the season started and was, like, only one thing left to do. I don't think people realize how hard it is to get to this point. So I'm just proud of our group. We lost two people who contributed a lot to our program last season. All we focused on was, it wasn't what we didn't have, it was what we had inside the locker room. I couldn't be more proud of our group and just the resiliency we showed all year. We've had a couple of tough losses, and that's what's made us ready for these type of moments. I think this matchup, you can't ask for anything better. I think it speaks to the way women's basketball has been tremendous on all levels all throughout the year. We know we have our hands full. Everybody around the country knows South Carolina has been the team all year. They've observed that. They've earned it. They've just been incredible. I've turned on the TV. Most of the times they've played because they're so much fun to watch, the depth that they have, the way they rebound the ball, the way they're shooting the ball. They've just been incredible. This is, we have five people on our team that this is the last time you get to put on your college uniform. I don't think you need much more motivation than that. We're going to give it every single thing we've got."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"It doesn't really matter. We don't look at it at all, to be completely honest with you. It's kind of similar, we've had familiarity with Colorado and LSU. And the only team I really went back and watched was Colorado just because they had everybody back from the previous year. LSU obviously was completely different in what they had, obviously some people returning, but added two different starters. This South Carolina team is completely different. Some of the stuff they run is completely different. We have to guard them completely different. The way they're shooting the ball. I mean, they start five different people. They switch up who they start at the 4 position from game to game. So we'll be prepared for either of those. I don't think it's something you go back and watch. I don't think it's very helpful at all, other than the fact of maybe what we did. At this point, there's only so much you can do to prepare on the court-wise. It's more so watching film of their recent games. And that's the biggest thing the coaches have been preaching."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think it's everything. They're just so disciplined in every single thing that they do. They shoot the ball really well at all three guard positions. They bring guards in off the bench that are really good. Obviously their height poses a challenge to us. And their rebounding poses a challenge to us. It's going to be very important that we try to box out. But I think going into that game last year, to say we're going to beat South Carolina on the glass is probably something that's not going to happen every single time we play them. But you have to be able to manage it the best you can. And I think we did that versus LSU, and that's where you get confidence from is just you kind of weather the storms on the glass, you try to come up with big ones when you can. But they're going to get some, but you have to limit some. I think those are the biggest challenges that they pose to us."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"To be honest, like I don't have many emotions of, like, this is the end for me. I certainly know it is, but I don't think I can go into the game feeling that. I don't think that would allow me to play my best. I think it's kind of similar to senior night for myself, or my last game in Carver versus West Virginia. You're so focused on competing and enjoying every single second that have and helping your team win that you're not too caught up in this is the last time I'm going to put on this uniform, this is the last time I'm going to be playing in this arena, this is the last. Like that's not how we view things around our program. It's, like, you're competing for this opportunity. You love this opportunity. Once the buzzer hits zero, whether we win or whether we lose, I'll definitely be hit with a wave of emotion, especially over the course of the next week, as things kind of change in my life quite a bit. I think just trying to enjoy every single second because I'm fortunate enough to be able to be in the National Championship again and give it everything I got."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I mean, no, I don't think so at all. I've played basketball at this university for four years, and for it to come down to two games and that be whether or not I'm proud of myself and proud of the way I've carried myself and proud of the way I've impacted people in their lives, I don't think that's a fair assessment. I guess going forward -- and I've talked about this with my legacy -- I don't want my legacy to be, oh, Caitlin won X amount of games or Caitlin scored X amount of points. It's I hope it's what I was able to do for the game of women's basketball. I hope it is the young boys and young girls that are inspired to play this sport or dream to do whatever they want to do in their lives. Yeah, I think it's just the people that we've brought together, the joy we've brought to people, the way people are recognizing women's basketball as a sport. It's fun to watch. Everybody loves it. It can be on the highest of stages. I think you see that with the viewership numbers. To me, for it to come down to 40 minutes and for me to validate myself within 40 minutes, I don't think that's a fair assessment."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think after last season, it was like, oh, my gosh, how can I possibly replicate the season we had? I think what we were able to do with that season was simply magical. The teams that we beat to get to the point that we were was really special. I think for myself it's, like, I always believe in this team. I believe in the people around me. Coach Bluder is so good at building teams. So I think there was always a belief from day one of we can get back to this national title game. A lot of things have to go your way. You've got to stay healthy. You have to make shots at the right time. You've got to have a little luck, things like that. I think it's been something that I've tried to soak in the best I can. Obviously it's hard when you're going from game to game and preparing every single weekend for two games. But I think it's something that you can't really dream and imagine these type of moments. Like, yes, I'm one that dreams big, but for it to be on this stage and this magnitude is something that's super special. I think once my career ends is when I'm really going to be able to soak it in and look back and enjoy every single second of everything that we did."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing for myself is when you're in the spotlight like this, there's going to be a million different opinions on you. For as many people that are going to love you, there are going to be people that don't like you. That's the case with every professional athlete, men or women, playing at the highest stage. I think what I've been able to do over the course of my career is just focus on the opinions of the people inside our locker room. That's what I really care about, the people that I love to death, the people that have had my back every single second of my career, have been the ones that have believed in me more than anybody. To me that's really the only opinions that I'm concerned with are my teammates, my coaches, my family, the people that I want to make proud every single day."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is like, no matter what we're doing -- whether it's media, whether it's open practice, whether it's a closed practice -- you just try to enjoy every single second and go about it with a smile on your face because there are so many people that would kill to be in our position right now. There's, what, 360 Division I basketball teams. And to be one of two left standing, that's a really amazing accomplishment within itself. I think the biggest thing is before every game I try to take a deep breath and look around and soak in the environment because, whether we've played on the road this year, whether we've played at home, whether it's been a neutral court, whether it's been here at the Final Four, Sweet 16 and Elite Eights, the crowds have been incredible. The way people are not only showing up, but cheering about the game and invested in the game. They understand the game. They know what's going on. They're passionate about it. To me, that's the coolest thing. So I just try to take a deep breath and look around as much as I can before the game starts and soak in every single second. I think that's been one of the coolest things for myself."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, I think that would be the cherry on top. That would be the top of the list, the thing that you're most proud of. That's something you get to share with your teammates. But at the same time, it would be for every Iowa women's basketball player that has come before us. There has been a long list of really amazing talent that have played in this program. Going back to when C. Vivian Stringer coached the Iowa women's basketball program, they were in the Final Four, I believe, twice, maybe once with her. So many tremendous players that have laid a foundation of people wanting to support our program. Before I showed up, there was people -- we averaged 10,000 fans. It wasn't magical all of a sudden that once we got good that people started showing up. They were there. They were supporting. That's the coolest thing about women's basketball in the state of Iowa. People appreciate it and know how good it is. To be able to win a national title for this university in a place that has loved women's basketball and done a lot for the game would be super special, not only for myself, but for my teammates and just this program and the university overall."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I would say the biggest thing is just thank you. That's what I always talk about is women's basketball isn't just suddenly good. It's been good. I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by coaches that have been in this game for a really long time. They coached when 50 people showed up to the game and nobody wanted to support them and what they were doing. Coach J, our associate head coach, who is one of the best women's basketball players our state has ever seen. For them to be at the forefront of laying a foundation of this is what women's basketball is and still nobody wanted to support it, for them to see how it's evolved is pretty incredible. They deserve it more than anybody else for them to be in these moments too. It isn't just the people that are in the college game right now. It's every single person that's come before us. Now you're seeing we are on ESPN, we are on nationally televised TV stations that people are, like, wow, this is so much fun to watch. They can't get enough of it. It is scheduled in their night. They're sitting down and watching. And I don't think it's only women's basketball. I think you see it across the board, whether it's softball, whether it's gymnastics, volleyball. People want to watch. It's just when they're given the opportunity, the research and the facts show that people love it."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I could talk about Kate for a really long time. If I played 139 games with her, I don't know how many she played, which is kind of crazy, because she's old. That girl is tougher than nails. This is her sixth year. She starts her career off with a torn ACL and misses her freshman season. I think Kate would tell you that was the best thing to ever happen to her. It gave her perspective on what basketball really is. It made her a better leader. She was a naturally born leader. But Kate is one of the best teammates I've ever had, the best teammates I've ever had. The thing about her is she's going to have her teammate's back every single day, every single second. To see the growth that she's taken as a basketball player this year, she's really upped her game, her play, while also being the best leader for this team. And if you don't have Kate Martin, we're not in this position. I don't know where our season ends, but we're not right here. That's how much she brings to our team. And every single person on our team would say that, player or coach. Kate grew up with a poster of Iowa women's basketball glued to her ceiling. That's what she fell asleep looking at every single night. And she embodies that in every single thing that she does. She truly cares about and loves every person she's been teammates with. I know it will be special for her to take the court one more time in an Iowa jersey."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think that's like one of the biggest things is my teammates ride my emotions whether I like it or not, whether it's positive or whether it's negative. That's something I've had to learn, they're going to feel what I feel. I'm their emotional leader. It's something I've embraced, and it's a powerful tool, like you saw. The things I can say about my teammates and truly believe and instill that confidence in them, that's one of the coolest things as a point guard, as a leader, as a friend, as a teammate. That's how much better you can make people by just believing in them and telling that to them, to their face. I think that's the biggest thing with Han is she's somebody who feeds off confidence. She feeds off the belief of her teammates. We know what she's capable of every single night. And being able to tell her that, not just show her that -- tell her and give her those words of affirmation and how much we believe in her, I think it just shows, as a teammate and a leader, how much we've all grown and how much she's grown."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think anybody who's been to the state of Iowa knows how good women's basketball is there. It starts at a very young age. The AAU program I played for was Nike EYBL team, All Iowa Attack. And we were in three Nike Nationals during my time there. They consistently produce really good talent in the state of Iowa, whether it's the high school basketball, whether it's the AAU circuit. But I also think it's the college programs we have in our state -- whether it's Iowa, whether it's Iowa State, whether it's UNI, whether it's Drake -- all four of those teams are teams vying for NCAA Tournament bids every single year. Drake and UNI obviously being in the same conference, usually both of them don't make it, but at least one of them do. Drake had a tremendous year, were in the NCAA Tournament. Really played Colorado pretty solid. But I think that's the biggest thing is people in the state of Iowa know how special women's basketball is there. People aren't just showing up to Iowa women's basketball games. They're showing up to Drake. They're showing up to UNI. They're showing up to Iowa State games. People love our game there. Every single year everybody plays each other. It's kind of like our state championship. That's one of the goals every year is you want to be state champion of playing those games. They're fun games to play. They're intense. They come down to the wire, and that's what makes them so fun."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think Raven's had a tremendous year. I think not only from a shooting perspective, but as the point guard of a team, as the guard of a team, she's been a true leader. She's led that team. After losing five starters, after losing Zia Cooke, who in my eyes was one of the best players in the country last year, I really admire everything that she's done this year. I think she's shooting over 50 percent in her last five games, has shot it over 40 percent all year. That just speaks to her work ethic. She got in the gym, and she got better, and I admire that. I think that's what makes great players great. And that's exactly what she did. I know this South Carolina team poses a totally different challenge. Obviously it's similar in some ways, but the way their guards shoot the ball is incredible. It adds a whole other dynamic for us to be prepared for."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think NIL has been a cool journey for myself. It's kind of evolved over the course of my career. Obviously we didn't have it my freshman year during COVID, and then that summer is when it really began. And nobody really knew what all it entailed, and I still feel like it's kind of that same way. There's just so many questions and not a lot of answers. Lucky for myself, I've surrounded myself with people that have my best interests at heart. They want me to be my best. And I think the biggest thing for myself, regarding NIL, is my focus has been 110 percent on basketball. If it's not, all that other stuff doesn't matter. That doesn't come along with it. I've been lucky enough to partner with a lot of really good brands that have the same values and same beliefs that I do, that are truly invested in women's basketball, they care about women's basketball. They want it to go to a place that it's never been before. So I think that's been the coolest thing for me. Additionally, the way student-athletes have been able to use it to make it their own. Everybody is passionate about different things. To be able to use that to show people, I don't know, things that you're interested in and change the lives of other people, I think has been the coolest thing. Also the way people have been able to give back to their communities and things they care about has been super special as well."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"It's crazy to wrap your head around 139 games. That seems like a ton of games. Lucky enough, we've had postseasons where we've gotten a lot of extra games, whether it's the Big Ten Tournament or the NCAA Tournament. We've been able to have some long seasons, and that's something I'm really thankful for. To be honest, I don't think I'd have the type of career if I don't have a teammate like Kate. She's been one that has had my back. She holds me accountable. I hold her accountable. But I think at the same time, me and Kate are wired so similarly that we get each other on a different level. She's so competitive. Her dad was a football coach growing up. She's one of the best leaders I've been around. She wants the best for her teammates. She's one of the most selfless people. Yeah, she's pushed me, and I've pushed her. I know, when we walk off that court tomorrow, win or lose, we'll have a lot to hold our head up about. I'm just grateful to not only have a teammate like her but a friend like her."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think coming into last year I wasn't totally prepared for all the obligations that you have at the Final Four, whether that's media, whether that's certain events, whether that's open practice, whether that's X, Y and Z. There's a whole long list. But I think the way I've tried to look at it is how lucky am I. I get to have this opportunity. I get to do these things. Our team gets to do these things. I think being able to have the experience of last year has certainly helped me more than anything. I don't view it as any type of responsibility. Sure, it's a responsibility, but this is something that has just come along with the way I've been able to carry myself and the way that I love this game, the way that I've been able to have fun with this game over the course of the last four years. It's been special. And if it's something you view as a responsibility, I'm glad I can be able to do it. So more than anything, I'm just thankful."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"One thing, it's hard when your season ends, no matter what stage it is. Then it's hard when you make it to the national title game and you're so close to accomplishing something so great -- we obviously accomplished a lot of really great things last year, but to be so close to a national title is, like, being able to compartmentalize all that at the same time was really hard. I think the biggest thing for myself is. I wasn't really upset that we lost the game. To be honest, LSU deserved to win. They beat us. They shot the ball great. They played a great game. I think it was more so the feeling of I don't want this to end. It was so much fun being in the Final Four, advancing to the national title game. I think it's the same thing right now. I don't want this to end, whether it's with a win or with a loss. I think the biggest thing is you have that little fire inside of you. It's been the same throughout my entire career. I've had some tough losses, and I think those are the moments that have prepared me for right now for this opportunity. At the end of the day, it's a game of basketball. You give it everything you've got, but I have a lot of appreciation for the way our team has carried ourselves and all the stuff that we've established, and we're going to give it everything we can to be able to go out there and be able to hoist the trophy tomorrow."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"At this time, we'll open up the floor for questions for Coach."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Thank you for the question. I understand it's a topic that people are interested in. But today my focus is on the game tomorrow, my players. It's an important game we have tomorrow, and that's what I want to be here to talk about. But I know it's an important issue for another time."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"This is a team that just doesn't have a lot of weaknesses. It's really hard to defend them. You know, Kamilla's been playing so well, just runs the floor beautifully, rebounds incredibly, shooting the ball well. One person can't stop her. There's no way. I don't know if two or three can stop her, to be quite honest. So I'm not going to give that up just to one person to have to try to handle that."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,Can she still change her mind? Is that possible? I don't know. I would like that very much.
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"It's not been this change from A to B, like happened so fast. It's been a growth over time. We've seen her sometimes regress and go back to kind of emotional -- and I don't like to say -- you know, like, passionate, take-me-out-of-my-game emotional versus now, I think she is playing unbelievable in this tournament. A lot of people have eyes upon her, and everybody wants to see her have that reaction, and she's not giving it to people. I love that about her. I think she's keeping her composure extremely well, still playing with that fire and that passion and that joy, but at the same time, not letting other people kind of get into her head or anything like that. Or accepting, if she thinks a call is bad, kind of accepting that and moving on to the next play. And we always talk about, like every coach does, controlling the controllables. That's something you can't control, and you have to move on. She's learning and has learned that over the course of this year really, really well. So I'm not sure there's been a point. I think it's been a gradual improvement."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"It's unbelievable to me that you're going to criticize a 22-year-old kid for something that she had no control over? I thought we handled that really well. We switched out onto it. I thought we were there to contest. I can't believe people would be so immature as to attack a 22-year-old on doing their job and doing it really, really well."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"That's a great question. I haven't given thought to that. Every kid is different. Every human being is different. I think the way that Caitlin has handled this has been almost textbook on how to manage outside expectations and all the extra media. I would tell another kid, a child or player coming up, you can all say no. You don't have to do everything. You don't have to answer every question. You don't have to do every interview. We've done, I think, a very good job, I think our sports information department has done a very good job of limiting Caitlin's requests because she would want to say yes to everybody because that's the type of person she is. Most young women want to say yes all the time to people who want to have a request like that. I would really caution them on having a good sports information protector around her. And also it's okay to say no and don't let it get to your head."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Extremely. We haven't lost since she moved into the starting lineup. She's playing exceptional basketball. She was before, but now she has this unbelievable opportunity, and she has just risen to the occasion. Some people might not do that. We've called her Chicago tough, and she is. She is a person that you can see last night, jumping on the floor for loose balls, get six offensive rebounds. You want me to defend that? That's okay, I'll do that. She doesn't back down to anybody. I think her play has helped us reach this level, no doubt."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I think we've been doing that all along. Ever since she made her decision, we've been intentional about remembering moments or spending time. Today I got to have breakfast with her. Just valuing that time and remembering it, like making sure you're there. Like when you're having time with your seniors, don't be distracted by scouting reports or by phones and that sort of stuff, but actually being there. To me, that's been important for all five of my seniors."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I would love for Molly to have that opportunity. She deserves it. My heart aches for that kid. Basketball is so important to her, and to have this happen to her -- honestly, we thought she was going to be back. We thought she was going to be back a couple weeks ago. For her to be able to stay, not bring any added attention to herself, like, oh, woe is me, it's amazing how she's handled this. I know how much it's hurting her. I would love to get her on the floor for a couple seconds. Hannah, let's keep riding that high. She knows she can do it now. Every challenge gets bigger. Look at the challenges she's had already in this tournament. Hannah has grown up throughout this tournament, and she's going to have an unbelievable challenge tomorrow. We're going to keep pouring into her. We're going to keep telling her that we believe in her. If a mistake happens, we're going to live with that, we're going to live with that because nobody's been able to stop Kamilla Cardoso. That's been a near impossible task."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I have not heard from Coach Stringer in the last couple of weeks. Hoping to hear from her at the end of the year. The last time I got to talk to her was at Rutgers, and Naismith honored her with a lifetime achievement to women's basketball. And I got to spend some good time with her there. I consider Coach Stringer a mentor, somebody that when I was first starting coaching in the early '80s, I would work her basketball camps just to be able to spend some time around her, just to be in her presence really and to learn from her. You remember the goofiest things. I remember after a camp session, her driving me home in her car back to my dorm, when I was staying in a dorm back then with the other campers. Then I would sneak over to her practices. We were only 50 minutes away, so it was easy for me to sneak into Carver-Hawkeye Arena and watch her practice. Coach Stringer is a low talker, and that made it really hard sometimes. I have so much respect for Coach Stringer. And I'm so -- Christine Grant hired both of us. We have that connection. I really value her and her opinion and the work that she did to establish this program."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I don't know if I'd consider myself the caretaker because there's so many people involved in Iowa basketball, and we have so many good programs in our state that are so good. But definitely being from the University of Iowa, you think about things a little bit differently because of Dr. Grant's legacy, because of her involvement in gender equity, Title IX, her push for women's athletics over and over again, putting herself out there. She taught all of us at Iowa how to be a little bit different in the way we think, the way that we go into a room and the way that we watch and the way that we think. I never want to forget those lessons she taught me. And I'm hoping, I'm hoping that I'm passing those lessons onto the women that I get to coach now because that's how that's passed along, right, that legacy, and that's important."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I think the consistency speaks for itself and what we were doing last year and how many games that those five women started together. I can't remember the exact number, but it was significant in that we got to this level last year. And then to do it again this year with, again, not all the same pieces but a lot of the same pieces, a lot of the key same pieces. Right now everybody's so eager to jump with the transfer portal, you look at a Syd, that's a prime example. Syd has had great comments about people had talked to her about leaving, but she recognized the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. And she believed in staying the course. She is a great example of why to stay with a program. If you're being motivated, if you're growing your game, wait your time, and it will be there, and it will be more fulfilling when you're there with the people that helped build it with you. Kate Martin, people are going to remember her as this tough kid that's got grit, is a leader. I've termed her as the glue of our team so much. She's going to be an unbelievable coach. She is a tremendous leader of young women. She is able to hold people accountable when it is not easy to hold your teammates accountable when you're 20 years old. And she doesn't back down to that. She is not scared of doing that. She has the respect of everybody in the room, so she's able to do that. Kate Martin's legacy will go down as one of the best leaders ever."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I think it's really important, and it's one of the things I learned last year, I feel from this experience, is that scouting reports are really good to look at and to read and memorize at this point, but not so much to go on the floor with. Legs are really, really important, especially when you're going against a South Carolina team that is so deep. You don't have the advantage of wearing people down. So rest is crucial. You're right, our season's been even longer because we actually did a 12-day trip overseas. But I think when you really like the people you're around, it's a lot easier. If you don't like the people you're having lunch with every day and spending time with every day, it can be a grind. But when you enjoy it, when you want to be together -- we're not sick of each other yet. We're really not."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Caitlin, I think that is another area of her growth. It was managing her emotions and then being able to communicate with her teammates in the correct way. She has learned that. Before, it was like all fire and no love. And now she understoods that you can give some fire if you've invested enough in the love part. So she's learned that this year and has done a much, much better job with that. I mean, Coach Staley, this is amazing. This may be the best women's basketball team we've seen. I think you could say that. They have all the parts. She's a tremendous recruiter, tremendous motivator, a tremendous example. Now she's our Olympic coach. Yeah, what she has done -- again, she's the one that keeps -- she's setting the bar. For a while it was Pat, then it was Geno. And now it's Dawn setting the bar for everyone else. You have to have someone set the bar, and she's doing it."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"Trust. In my opinion -- I mean, you can't go into anything that's hard unless you trust the people around you. And we have built trust. And we're going to have to have an amazing amount tomorrow to step off that ledge because it's a big one. But I do believe that it really comes down to something so simple as I trust the person to the left and to the right of me, and I know they're going to do their job to the best of their ability."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I think everybody goes into the season with kind of a game plan, right? You go into a game with a game plan, and you think this is what's going to be best. But you've got to make adjustments along the way. If it's going astride, if it's not going as well as you think, you've got to change things. So my goal is always to have the best five players on the floor, right? I mean, it sounds so simple -- not positionally the five best players, but the five best players. I don't care if you're a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I don't give them numbers like that. I just want the best players on the floor. And in my opinion, this was our best five players. Hannah had to adjust from something she wanted to be, which is that power forward, to something we needed her to be, and that was the center. So there was a few growing pains in that, but she's obviously adapted very, very well to that and now is embracing it. It took a while for her to embrace it, but now she is."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I keep feeling like we're playing in games everybody wanted to see, the LSU game, the UConn game, and now the South Carolina game. We've been tested for sure. We're battle tested. It would mean a lot to our program because it's never happened before. So obviously that's for Iowa. But for those five seniors, and especially for Caitlin, to be able to go out like that would be just an unbelievable accomplishment. Also, we love our fans. We would love to bring that home to the state of Iowa. Last year I felt like we gave so much joy. Even through losing, we gave so much joy to the people of Iowa and really to people across the country, according to the letters and e-mails that I got. I want to do that again. But I could do it with a W too."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I genuinely believe every time that Caitlin breaks a record or comes off a game, there are thousands of boys and girls out shooting and wanting to be 22, thousands. I mean, she has inspired that next generation of kids. There's absolutely no doubt. Now, hopefully they won't start with logo 3s. Hopefully they'll start with something a little bit closer. But she has been a motivator for so many people. Hannah Stuelke is special. All my women are special honestly. I just love that kid. She's somebody you just want to hug. You just want to hug that kid."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"I think that officiating is a topic that's always talked about. So I think we need to invest in some younger officials coming along and learning the game and having the courage to get into this game because it is not easy. I don't know how you could find anybody to be an official, to be quite honest. It is a horrible job. So I think we need to really work on that. I think that's an important part of our game."
2024 - NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL FOUR: SOUTH CAROLINA VS IOWA,"April 6, 2024",LISA BLUDER,"We talk about Caitlin so much, but she only has one locker. She's just one part of our team. Certainly her legacy, we've talked about it a ton. She set record after record after record. But one of our values is everyone matters, so all five of those starters -- Sharon Goodman was in the starting lineup this summer. She doesn't get off the bench right now. She matters. She matters a lot. All of our seniors, Kate and Gabbie, what they've done in their roles, Molly, everyone has been instrumental. So we all love Caitlin to death, everyone loves her, but she's only got one locker. It's not like she's got a palace in there."
