2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I started off just being an athletic girl, wanting to play hard, run around. Had a high motor. That kind of took me pretty far. I realized that that was something that was going to get me on the court, doing those little things, taking charges."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Then once I got to high school, my coach told me if you can guard multiple positions, you know you're going to play. So I think I carried that with me all the time. As I got into college, I started to watch film. I started to watch my opponents and learn different defensive schemes and all that stuff."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's been a journey, but it's been a great journey."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I actually am from New York, so I used to go to Liberty games growing up. I was a ball girl a couple times. I've been around the W for a little bit."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So being able to purchase tickets to sit front row, seeing that, they were giving out free tickets at one point for girls to come in and just have a crowd. To now playing against Iowa and selling out our crowd at home, just to see that evolution and that aspect, and now I haven't been to that many, but I think I went to one of the playoff games with the Liberty last year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just to see that in itself, being a young girl, thinking that the stadium was so huge to coming in there going, you've played in stadiums like this but now it's filled up, it's filled to the top, I think it's great to show people that once you invest in women that they can give back in a lot of ways."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't. I did not envision this, not because I didn't think I was capable but because I didn't know. I think honestly until I was in maybe about ninth grade, my freshman year of high school, I had to learn the path that it took to get to the W. I was around it, but I didn't know the path that it took to get there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Once I learned that these colleges come and you get a free education and you get to experience so many different things -- I've had the opportunity to play on USA teams. So just for me, just understanding everything that comes with it. I didn't expect to be here, but I'm here, and I am so excited that Indiana has taken the opportunity on me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I played with Caitlin when I was at USA for a couple years. So we played together there. But from going against her this year to being able to play with her and also Aliyah Boston, as well, it brings me some comfort, honestly."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Very excited and so proud of what they've done and how they've grown, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, it was definitely a tough decision for me last year, but I told people that I would never trade the decision I made to go to Ohio State. I think it has brought me so much peace in who I have become as a player and the impact that I can make in any program that I choose or organization that I have the opportunity to be a part of."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that mindset and going into Ohio State and coming in and realizing that I can make a little impact, I'm not here to change anything, but I'm just here to sprinkle a little of me in there and try to impact in any way that I can is really helpful."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Then yeah, playing with Caitlin now is honestly really cool. We've had the opportunity, like I said, to have that sold-out crowd at our place and then going to her place and having that last regular-season home game for them. Just having the opportunity to play with her again, it's going to be amazing. She's done so much for the women's game, and I know she has so much more to give to everyone. Just a lot of excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously adaptability is definitely a big thing, being able to go to a different country, adapt to the environment, adapt to the culture. Overseas is definitely a different way to play ball. They play ball pretty differently there. Just having that prior experience. I know there are a lot of people in the W that are from overseas."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that prior experience, even playing with the caliber of players that I played with, I think all in all, everything together has helped me become the player I am today. I'm very hopeful and very confident that it will help me in the W."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I think pro level of play would probably be the best one. It's just pretty different. They're used to playing against grown women. They're used to that physicality. I think all together it has helped me in many facets of the game of basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's really focused on trying to make the team. Obviously that's the first step going into it, and having confidence in myself and trying to make that. If I do, and when I do get the opportunity to play against them, I think it's just going to be such a surreal feeling. I'm there to compete. I'm there to try to make a roster spot. I'm trying to stay in the league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think a lot of it is just excitement, surreal, because I've seen them play. I was younger watching them play. But definitely very competitive and just excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously very, very big defensive-minded kid, but at the same time, I'm willing to do whatever it is that a team needs me to do. I'm willing to come in there and impact. I'm really big on community. So just getting my hand in the community and continuing to be who I am and continuing to make an impact in every stop that I've had."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I didn't have the opportunity to really, really get to know her. When I was recruited by Ohio State coming out of high school, she was there. So I got to see her on my visits a couple times. That was probably the biggest interaction. But very hands on, very big about coming to be a Buckeye."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think it's kind of interesting that that was the school that I was looking at coming out of high school. I ended up finishing my college career there, and now I get to play with a Buckeye. I think that's also going to give me some comfortability. She's a great player and so much I can learn from her. I'm just ready to go in there to work and continue to learn."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's special. I think taking that fifth year was something I thought long and hard about and I'm glad I did. A lot of good things came from it. Obviously having Emmy next to me it makes everything easier and that much more special. She's had a huge impact on me and everyone at Ohio State, and it's been really cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"She's everything to me. She's my why. She's why I do it, why me and my brother work so hard at it. She's special, and I really hope so. I know it'll be a little harder for them to travel, but I feel like absolutely they'll make it to some games."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's a surreal moment because I grew up as a little kid watching all these women play and how talented they are and being able to have a chance to play with them and compete against them, it's a dream. It's what we all are here for, and it's what we're looking forward to."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"I'm excited. I've seen the growth. Everyone has seen the growth, and to be a part of that is something that is really rare, so I'm looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Absolutely. I think that's something that's really big in today's world, especially with our class. It's exciting just to have those opportunities as women athletes. I think that's something that is kind of new to us, and it's exciting and it's absolutely something people should take advantage of. To be honest, I'm just ready to go play ball down there right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I think there's going to be an adjustment period for all of us, whether people want to admit it or not. I'm looking forward to it and welcoming it. As a rookie I think that's something you have to accept and be ready for."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"The pace, the length, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of things that are a little different and it'll take some time to get used to, but I'm welcoming that challenge and looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot. I've gotten to spend some time with some vets the past couple days and they've been really helpful. Just staying confident with who you are and what you do well is something that I took from them just a couple days ago. But I think that's important because when you're good at something, you can excel in that area and really keying in on that and taking that with you to the next level is definitely something I'll take from them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"I'm excited to play with everyone, to be honest on that team. Like I said, I grew up watching them, and I think being able to play with them now and getting that opportunity is something that, like I said, was a dream. They're a really talented group, and I know they're going to push me day one when I get there, so I'm excited for that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Competing really against everyone. The league is -- the talent, you guys have seen it and it's no joke and it's something I'm looking forward to and excited for, and like I said, there will be an adjustment, but I'm super excited."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I was there for a minute and I got to experience Buckeye Nation and just staying in Ohio, which was amazing. I think just the way we represented that university and the way they're going to continue to, it's an honor to put on that jersey every day, it's an honor to play in front of Buckeye Nation every night. I just hope that we left a legacy of hard work going out there every night and giving it our all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,JACY SHELDON,"As far as representing the university and our fans, I hope we made them proud."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My conversations were great with T Spoon. As you know, she was coached by Coach Mulkey, so I kind of thought maybe I'll go there. Knowing like the conversations were so good and she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a Black woman and as a head coach, and everything she's done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Jeff Pagliocca, the GM, was amazing, too, and player development is something that I was looking for and they looked for in me. I'm super excited for this move, and I'm just looking forward to getting to Chicago."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My first time playing Kamilla was on one of the biggest stages in my life, when she played for Hamilton Heights and I played for St. Frances in high school and we battled. Now being able to be teammates is going to be amazing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I actually talked to her earlier, was congratulating her. I know she came off an amazing run, an amazing college career. I'm looking forward to playing with her in practice and in games, just bouncing off of each other. So I'm excited for this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,I don't know. I don't know what movie right now. I don't know what movie right now.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Ooh, summertime Chi-town. To be cute on and off the court. I've always been to Chicago. The shopping is great. Just the lifestyle. I'm excited. I feel like I'm a Chi-town girl."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,Something Megan Thee Stallion. I love Megan Thee Stallion. Megan Thee Stallion or Beyonce.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I have had so many people reach out to me from so many different places. Understanding our impact isn't just within our school, within just the U.S., but it's worldwide. It's amazing to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Going out of the country when we go out of the country with my team, with LSU, it was like so much fun because they all recognized us and they knew us and it felt like home. I feel like anywhere we all go, and this draft class is amazing, anywhere we go, we're known. This is super cool because women aren't usually recognized around the world like how we are, and it's not even just basketball. It's the impact we've left on people's lives outside of there. It's super cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I think our duo, me and Kamilla versus Cam and Rickea is going to be cool to see. That's going to be fun."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Just be you. A lot of people may just tell you that you can't do certain things, and you're going to get more yeses and nos, and I had to realize that. Just being able to be authentic, and people love me because of who I am. I had those tough conversations. I say things that a lot of people are scared to say, and take that scary step. I took a scary step of faith going to LSU, not knowing what could happen, and look how my life has completely changed."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Being able to just believe in yourself, trust in yourself and have an amazing team behind me is great."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I mean, I didn't know what I was going to do. Obviously coming back would have been amazing for me, but I wanted more for myself. I wanted to start over. I feel like I had been at a high since the National Championship, and I want to hit rock bottom. I want to be a rookie again. I want to be knocked down by vets, and I want to be able to get up and grow and be a sponge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"I'm just super excited to play with the amazing players and against amazing players. This league is really competitive and I'm a competitive player, so I want to play against a lot of great players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Well, my mom was crying before the show even started, so it started there. Then my brother was like agitating me, I bet you 100 that you cry, I bet you 100 that you cry. He kind of got me, too. And I had a great conversation, like she was saying, with Chicago, so I kind of knew -- if it wasn't the Mystics, I knew it was going to be Chicago that was going to be calling me home."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"It means everything. I mean, like I said, on and off the court, we're amazing. We're not just basketball players, we're super impactful to the community, the people around us, the little kids that look up to us, and being able to also be nationwide, everybody knows us everywhere we go. Our lives aren't normal. We might get a little bit of normalcy going into the league now, but I'm just excited to be a trailblazer. I'm excited to be a part of history, and just continue to see the future, and I know it's bright."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, it's huge. Obviously traveling from the other side of the world or from Australia, it's a lot. Like I'm still jet-lagged and everything. I've still got emotions running through and I can barely sleep. But it's great."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"It's great to just look back, knowing that my country back home, my family and my friends they're all proud of me and they're all supporting me, watching me, especially my mom. She's done so much for me, my family and stuff, making sacrifices for us. Growing up I didn't come from a big basketball sporty world, and just played it because I loved it and my siblings played it, and then to get where I am now, it's incredible."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Obviously being in Australia, it's a bit difficult to watch the games and get to it and stuff, but I think as the years progressed, we started getting to know the game a bit more and obviously it's like a little sisterhood. We've got the WNBL now on our side and we've got the WNBA, so you get to know about it. And we've got Australians and grads that play in the WNBA, as well, so then you get to study that, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, well, growing up in juniors, I'd always be the scorer, attacking the rim, being an offensive player and stuff. But as I headed into the pro league, being young, there's already people doing all that. You have to make sacrifices. You need to learn the game a bit more, learn your other strengths. For me, it was defense. My length, being able to guard different positions, different players, being able to switch on to different people and just using my length, my ability, my quickness to kind of get around people."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"For me, I think when I play defense and I play great defense, it brings my offense naturally. So it's like, it just comes to me, and I don't have to force anything. So that's probably why I do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm very excited. Obviously playing in a different league and then coming into another one is great. The lifestyle, the people you play against, what we learn in the game here is obviously a bit different, so getting to learn that, playing against people, taking things from them, what I can add into my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"All of them. All the WNBA players. It's so different back home. Again, like in the WBNL we do have imports that come and play, we had Tiffany Mitchell, Jordin Canada and being able to play against them and with them is huge, no matter whether they're guards or bigs, just playing against all of them and seeing the differences in how they all play and just -- yeah."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's amazing. Like I haven't been there before, but stories, everything I've heard about it, we've got fellow Aussies over there, as well. We've got Paul Goriss that's also there, as well, and he's been good to me, as well. He's talked to me then and there. He's been texting me and stuff, and Kristy Wallace. She's amazing, as well, on the court and off the court, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"But I think just getting to know everyone, getting the experience, the new lifestyle and just -- as well as the coaches and the staff and everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's cool. It's amazing seeing fellow Australians in the WNBA, and they're achieving what you're achieving, as well. It's a privilege, honestly. It's such a great thing, and it's like -- I feel like it's just good that people can look at it and be like, wow, these Australians can play because I feel like that's one thing we don't really get sometimes, and we've had people like Lauren Jackson providing that for us."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I hope one day we can leave that kind of legacy to younger kids and everyone, as well, in this generation, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm not really having any expectations. Just going in there with an open mind, making sacrifices. It's going to be hard. I'm young. They're great professional players, talented athletes. It's going to be hard, and I'm coming from a different country, different environment and a new lifestyle."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NYADIEW PUOCH,"Just taking it day by day, learning experience, talking to the vets, talking to everyone around there and just building that on to my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I think it's great because I could do both, and either spot they need me to play that I could just sharpen in that area and get really good and just excel."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I think that I just bring versatility and just a physicality to the game of basketball, and so that's what mostly they'll be seeing from me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think just my teammates and how much time we spent together. I think that's something I'll miss, all the memories and things like that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Definitely the community in Salt Lake City. I think it's really grown on me the last two years I was there, and I'm going to miss it a lot because even though I came from another Pac-12 school, they still took me with open arms and just supported me throughout everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,I'm just looking forward to just starting this new journey and hopefully having a great rookie season.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,Just that I'm a humble person and somebody who is really for the community and just loves to represent my people. I think I just especially this year just try to tap into representing my culture and just being that inspiration for young kids who look like me and are of my same background.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I just think that impact is something that I'll carry with me to the WNBA, and I just hope that's what people see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I have a little bit. Gianna and Jenna have talked about Minnesota a lot and just how it is a very basketball-oriented state, and there's been so much rich culture of that there. So I'm excited to see it and experience it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think they'll just get somebody who's a competitor and somebody who has a unique style of play and is just fun to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,I'm very excited to just be able to play at the next stage and kind of just improve in areas that I need to to really excel at the next level.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, growing up in Alaska was great. I would say I loved my childhood. It was just so much fun, camping, fishing, doing a bunch of outdoor stuff, and it's a beautiful state. The only problem I think was just the isolation it had from the rest of the world, and how much it lacked exposure and just sports and things like that. But I wouldn't have had it any other way. I loved my state and carry that with a lot of pride."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"I know going to Minnesota the cold probably won't bother me since I'm used to that, but I'm excited to be in a new environment and place."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"The football question, that's just played a big part in my life, I think, just kind of building up the physicality I played with. It's helped me a lot with that. Just having an older brother, he plays for the Dolphins now, just kind of looking back on it, how we were literally on the same team and competing against each other, it's cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ALISSA PILI,"We're both very fortunate to be doing what we love at the highest level, and it's just a blessing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, first, I'm super excited to be drafted to Phoenix. I know they have some really amazing players there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"But yeah, I think I'm super motivated. Obviously since being a kid I've always wanted to play in the WNBA. To have this opportunity means the absolute world to me, and I'm just excited to go out to Phoenix and get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I'll definitely miss the people. I love my teammates, my coaches and the staff around there, and them helping me so much. I know that in the dub I'll be a little bit more independent, so I'll probably miss the extra help of people telling me what to do. But I'm excited for what's next."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I know at some point I have to grow up, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think it really was. I think I learned so much about myself as a player and especially as a leader. We had a really young team this past year, and I felt like I was able to grow my game and my leadership. I loved playing with my teammates and they always challenged me to be better, but I definitely think any leadership. I used to be so shy as a kid, so to see where I am now, I'm just so proud of that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I'm so excited to learn from both of them. Obviously they have a lot of great guards there, and Diana Taurasi is like the GOAT of basketball, so to be able to learn from her is going to be so fun and I can't wait for that. Natasha Cloud, I love her energy. I love when she used to play for Mystics and she was so fun to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,It's kind of unreal to be able to say that like I'm going to be teammates with Diana Taurasi and Natasha Cloud.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think going in the third round, that's just a number, and I think I'm just going to go out there and do my best and show what I can. I'm really confident in my skills and my abilities. Obviously, I've earned this moment to be here."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"So I think, like I said, that's just a number, and I'll go out there and try my hardest and make the team."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,All the flavors tonight. All the flavors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I think I was just nervous the entire night, so the feelings didn't really change. I was pretty much nervous. But I know when I heard my name, I was just so excited, and I can't wait to get to work in Phoenix."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I mean, if you saw my face, I don't think anything was going through my head at the moment. I was so positively overwhelmed, and just having all of them around me, all my people in the stands, at the table, knowing that my family, my friends from back home are watching, it's surreal. It's why I'm here. Without them, I would never be here sitting and answering your questions."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I owe everything to them, and I'm just truly blessed and so grateful for Seattle to give me this opportunity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Thank you for your question. I love Sue. I love her so much. I remember watching her when I was a kid, trying to mimic her moves. Being at UConn after her has been a huge deal for me. Very, very humbling experience. She's one of the greatest."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"To be able to have this opportunity again, I mean, it's a full-circle moment for me. I can't believe it. It's got to be some higher power, something else going on, because I have no words for this. It's a full-circle moment for me, and I'm just so blessed."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I honestly have no idea about the jersey number. That's honestly the least thing on my mind. That's not what I'm thinking about, but when I find out, I'll find you and tell you first."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. I feel like going back to when I had to make my college decision, UConn was a challenge, especially coming in with my class, Paige Bueckers, No. 1 player in the country, that was a huge challenge, but I took it. I feel like it paid off, and that's one decision that I'm so happy and proud that I made in my life because all of that led to this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to your question, I feel like first and foremost, I obviously -- their roster, just looking at it, those are some iconic women. Those are some iconic basketball players, people that I want to learn from, that I want to listen to, that I want to get challenged by, that I want to get yelled at, everything, all of the above. I'm ready for it, and I feel like it's kind of like a similar thing for me going to UConn and going to this place. Obviously, this is the next level."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But I feel the same. I feel eager to learn. I feel eager to be challenged and eager to fail and rise up, and I feel like that coaching staff and that team will do it for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"The one thing that I want to bring is being a good teammate. I want to create amazing relationships over there. I feel like that's what makes and helps teams win, and I want to be a part of that winning program because it truly is a historic winning program."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Well, first and foremost, I feel like this was something that I didn't even dare to dream about, if I can say it that way. I always felt like it was such a reach. It was something far more beyond me and bigger than me. But luckily I had people around me, my teammates, my friends, my family, my coaches, everybody that made me believe in it, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I always trust my work ethic. I feel like that's my best asset, how hard I work, how I don't give up, how I learn from my mistakes."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Obviously I'm going to fail, and that's fine. But it's how you react to it. I'm ready for all the challenges. I'm ready for whatever is thrown my way. But I know I'm going to respond in a positive way and how a true competitor does."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Absolutely. Thank you for the question. I feel like as you grow, you learn and you mature. When I came in as a freshman, I didn't understand that you don't have to be in the gym all day. It's how hard you work for those 45 minutes, those 20 minutes, and how consistent you are with it. I feel how my coaching staff, especially Morgan Valley, my coach, she kind of helped me guide me through that. This last, my senior year, I spent 25 minutes before every single practice, even on the days that I didn't feel like it, even on the days that I was tired, and shot threes and shot mid-ranges."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"That 40 percent that you mentioned is purely the testament to my hard work and dedication and her being in that gym with me every time. I'm so grateful to her. But I'm also very proud of myself and how I just remained consistent and proved to myself that consistency is the key, because hard work I already have it. Consistency was the key for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yes, thank you. I feel like us UConn players, we're a family. It doesn't matter if we played 30, 20, 10 years ago or even before that, or you're playing right now or you are going to play in the future. Everybody is connected. That's what the coaching staff does a great job of, creating that family atmosphere, that strong bond and connection that lasts forever."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"That's how it is with Sue. She's been over to UConn so many times, whether that's like fun stuff or coming to watch our games or trying to help us and guide us and give us advice, because we all truly look up to her a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I mean, I'll say it again, it's a full-circle moment for me. All the things that kind of led up to this, it's crazy. I can't believe it. But I'm just super grateful and I can't wait to see her. I'm sure she's going to be of a great help, and my mentor and somebody that's going to guide me, and I want that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to your other question. Absolutely, Nneka, Skylar, those women are incredible, on and off the court. I can't wait to learn from them, and of course I watched them. Skylar, I watched her so much. Nneka, I mean, she hugged me and I almost passed out over there. And obviously the rest of the team. When you look at the names, what they've done -- I always go back to not just on the court but off the court with the influence that they have. I can't wait to be a part of that. I can't wait to learn. I can't wait to just listen and sit back and try to get everything I can from such influential, iconic women. I'm super, super excited. I can't wait to meet all of them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, I mean, that's a funny question because growing up, I didn't really have the opportunity to watch WNBA games. Even now in Croatia, people have to find their ways to watch those games. I feel like what I remember, I would sit in my living room with YouTube and find games or highlights or anything that I can. I remember watching Brittney Griner in my living room. It's just those little things that stick with me. But it was hard to find places and ways to watch these women."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I feel like seeing now especially with this draft class that I'm a part of, amazing athletes, amazing people that brought women's basketball to another level, and I always say, all the players before us that paved the way for us, they deserve their flowers, and they deserve to be recognized. I feel like we're moving toward that direction, and I never think it's too late. I always think there's time to be better and improve and grow, and I feel like we're on the right track."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yeah, Aaliyah has been there from the start. That's my sister. That's my family. I met her even before we both committed to UConn. Can you guys believe how full circle -- it's so many full-circle moments I can't even fathom right now. We met before at NBA Academy, BWB, and I loved her instantly. Our bond is strong. We don't need no words. You can feel it. You can feel the energy. To be able to here with her and share this has been nothing but incredible, and something that I'll remember for the rest of my life because it would not be the same if she wasn't here with me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I'm so proud of her. She's going to do amazing. She's going to do great. Everything that she did, she deserves. She put her head down and she worked. Even without all the recognition that she did deserve but she didn't get at times, she didn't care. She put her head down and she knew that something great will happen, and it did tonight. I'm so happy for her."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But to get back to the other question, Paige, Azzi, Aubrey, Caroline, all my teammates watching at home, I love them so much. I owe them everything, and I can't wait for my younger teammates and everybody that's coming back next year to have this moment, too, because I know they will. I'll be proudly watching and cheering for them, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,I'm just so grateful to be able to call them my sisters and my family and have such great support even though I'm not home. This is my home away from home. They are my home away from home.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"Yes, absolutely. I feel like I couldn't get more prepared than being at UConn, surrounded by all the coaches, but especially Coach. He's just a legend. When UConn called, I couldn't say no. That was the opportunity of a lifetime for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,Every single thing in that culture that he built in that program aligns with me and who I am as a person and who I strive to be and get better at being.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"But just the things I went through with him is so much, and he's my best friend. He's not just my coach, he's my best friend. He's been there from the start. When I failed, through the worst things, through the best things, he always stuck by my side and never left. I'll cherish that bond and that relationship that I have with him forever."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"I'm so grateful and happy that he was there tonight, along with all my coaches, at the table and in the audience. They prepared me. They pushed me. They cussed me out when they had to. They yelled at me when they had to. They praised me when they had to. They just did everything right."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,NIKA MUHL,"So grateful because not just as a basketball player they have changed me, but they changed who I am as a person. They made me a better person and they make me want to be even better. I'm grateful for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I think my emotions have been so up and down over the last six weeks. I had different expectations in February than I did at the end of March. I think I've been dealt with what I've been dealt with, and the only way to really move on is to have a positive outlook."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Honestly, I'm so excited for the fit. I'm really excited for Vegas. I think that's really promising. To be able to learn from the people at Vegas for the next year, what more could you ask for? If I'm not able to play on the court, I know that I'll be able to benefit mentally and emotionally just by observing what they have there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I'm really excited, and that's my No. 1 emotion right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Well, they're always there for me, first of all, no matter if I go out and have 25 in a game or if I can't play. I know they're going to be at the game. They're going to be the first ones hugging me afterward. That support has meant the world to me over the last 15 years that I've been playing basketball or sports at all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"For them to be able to be here with me on draft night, my family, my sister, my parents, it means everything to me. It's not just a testament to what I've been able to do but how they've been able to help me get here."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I didn't start playing basketball super seriously until probably middle of high school, so I wasn't exposed to it super early. But I also think the media didn't push it as much. Even though I played basketball in high school, it wasn't necessarily something that was super popular in the media."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"But I'm super excited for it to be taking that trajectory. The class that I'm in right now has done an incredible job to bringing attention to women's sports, women's basketball, and now taking it into this league I think is super exciting."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I think we're already seeing the impact of that on little girls. I think they're way more aware of it than I was at that age, and that's super exciting. I think with expansion coming up and all that stuff, it's headed toward a really good place. I'm really excited to be a part of it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, honestly I'm thrilled. I can't think of a better situation to be in with the situation that my leg is in, because it's just an incredible fit. I think their resources are amazing, their facilities are awesome. To be able to look up to the players there, to be able to watch A'ja Wilson, even though I can't play, I know I'll be able to learn so much and get better just by watching and being around the culture that's there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"That means everything. Those five years at Virginia Tech were so, so special. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The people I had around there, the teammates, the coaches, they were just incredible. They made me who I was. For me to bring that attention to Virginia Tech, to take it to a Final Four, win ACC championships, was just so fun. For them to recognize me I think is really, really cool, but it's also just making me really proud of the program that we were able to create there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I was just able to talk to Coach Becky Hammon a little bit. Obviously there's a little bit more to be figured out, but she spoke about the medical staff there and just working on getting me out there, so we can see where I am and start taking those steps to get me back on the court again because obviously that's the ultimate goal."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"But I'm super excited. I think seriously it's a great fit for all of those things. I know that they'll support me, and we'll all have the same goal of getting me healthy and helping to contribute. We'll take it day by day but with that in mind for next year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah. I mean, he's taught me everything I know. I didn't come into college expected to be anything really. I really didn't take basketball super, super seriously. I thought I wanted to play softball when I was little in college. He completely changed my perspective on that. He made me fall in love with the game to the point where you couldn't get the two of us out of the gym together. We just love spending time with each other in there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm looking into them pouring into me, and I'm doing the same on and off the court."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"I'm so excited to play with Cam. We're both competitive. We're young. We're feisty but we're still going to bring that game offensively and defensively. I know if I get beat off the dribble, Cam is swatting into the second row. So I'm ready for that, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm excited to bring my versatility, play at any position, taking advantage of whether it's a small guard on me or bigger or slower player. I'm excited about that. Then I just want to work on getting in tip-top shape after the injury. My conditioning was in the game trying to get back. I feel like when I'm in tip-top shape, world-class shape, that's when I'm playing my best both ends of the floor."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm definitely excited. I'm just grateful that L.A. believed in me. They see something in me, and I see something in them, too. I had great talks with them prior to the draft, so I'm just grateful for it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Playing at Tennessee and Mississippi State, it's prepared me for this moment because life is just trials and tribulations, but how you get through those, and I feel like I've overcome a lot of adversity. I've continued to stay strong, and that's what got me to where I am today."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, it's crazy to say, but I didn't even think about how the draft process goes. I thought you just show up to draft day and you kind of get drafted. I didn't know if they even speak to you prior to the draft. Really crazy of me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'll answer your second question first. Definitely. This is generational class. I feel like this class is just so different. I know this class is different. I feel like the viewership is peaking. Women's basketball is on an uproar. Everybody is tuning in. We averaged better than the men this year. Not to say we're in competition, but that just says a lot. I'm grateful to be a part of this draft class. I feel like we're just trending in the right direction."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Probably the pace of the game. I feel like high school to college, it was a different pace, so I feel like it's probably going to be that same thing in the league, going up against the world's best players. I feel like that's going to be pretty tough. But I'm excited for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, to be in the conversation with those greats is so crazy and mind blowing to me. I'm just grateful to have Candace come to our games sometimes, have Tamika Catchings, have Jordan Horston in my ear, and they continue to support me. Jordan texted me how much she was proud of me, texted me a little bit about the process. Tamika and I speak every now and then. She's just always pouring into me. I just call her my big sister. Just to have that contact with a Tamika Catchings, it's like, whoa."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"She doesn't even know it, but when she came to our practice and she was acting like she knew me, you don't even know but I was over here like, girl, you're Tamika Catchings. That was pretty cool to experience, though."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"I would give her advice of just be true to who you are. Problems are going to come, challenges are going to come, but the way that you handle it is what builds character. I feel like there's always a light at the end of the tunnel and just continue to just push, push, push. If she plays basketball, I would say repetition is everything. Get the fundamentals down, just work on the little things before -- this generation is a little more flashy, but the fundamentals are everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, growing up I didn't like basketball at all. I just wanted to do girly stuff. I just wanted to be a ballerina and cheerleader. I didn't watch basketball growing up. But once I picked up a ball and I started to see how serious this could go, I really started tuning in a lot. I watched every WNBA basketball game. Even if I can't, I record it and then I'd go back and watch it. I don't look at the score because I like to feel like it's still live. I like that excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Just L.A. as a whole, I know they weren't where they wanted to be. Championships, everyone wants a championship. I feel like I'm just excited to be a part of this journey. I feel like we're going to be really good, just looking at the roster itself. I'm just excited. I've watched them play, so I'm kind of familiar of how they like to play, their style of play."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"So that's pretty cool, and I feel like I'm going to fit in really well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yes, I'm so excited to play with Zia. It's so full circle. We grew up knowing each other. We played AAU together. We live like an hour away from each other, but that's my best friend, so we're still really close."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,But I feel like basketball is just always bringing us back together in the craziest ways. We took our four visits together coming out of high school. I'm so excited to play with my girl. I feel like this is just going to reconnect us on that deep level again.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm honored, honestly, that she said something like that about Cam and I. I truly believe that, as well. I feel like what Cam and I bring is just foundational, like you said. I feel like we're willing to put in the work. We're willing to do whatever as rookies. So I feel like that's pretty, pretty good, and I'm just excited to get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"It played a big role, knowing that we have a few athletes that have already came out of there, and to be one of them means a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"To know that I'm going to such a special team with quite a few veterans means a lot. It's something like a perfect situation, I'm coming in to learn, and there's a lot to learn from, and like I said, there are a few vets on this squad. So to be able to walk into this situation is kind of perfect for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"The first thing I would say to them is don't allow anyone to dim your light, no matter your size. I've dealt with that all the way up until today, tonight. Other than that, I would say that no matter what happens, if you want to achieve something, you can do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"I want to learn from the vets as much as possible. I want to add a little bit of everything to my game. I want it to expand. I also want my IQ for the game to expand, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"Yes, I can score the ball, but what else are you able to do? I think that with those guards over there, they're going to do a wonderful job of helping me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"I'm very excited. I think that it's a full-circle moment for me. I was nominated for that Becky Hammon point guard award, I believe, three seasons in a row when I was at Buffalo. For me to have not received it and to be drafted by her when the time was right has been a full-circle moment, so I'm ready, and I'm ready to go."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Good evening, everyone. It's great to see you all here. Welcome to the 2024 WNBA Draft presented by State Farm. This honestly is one of, I think, my favorite days of the year. We're thrilled to be at the famed Brooklyn Academy of Music for the first time."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"BAM is actually America's oldest performing arts center, hosting some of the brightest talents across a wide range of concentrations since 1861. Tonight, BAM hosts some of the brightest talents in basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"You all may have noticed the fans coming in tonight, and I know some of you got held up. We apologize. But this is the first time the draft has had fans in attendance since 2016. Tickets sold out in under 30 minutes, and that was before the players declared for this draft. Just another illustration of the passion and excitement surrounding the WNBA right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The next chapter in each player's basketball journey starts tonight. I have the ultimate honor of calling their names and seeing the excitement from them, their families, their friends and team representatives as they take the first step of their professional careers."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is just one ""Welcome to the W"" moment for this class. I spent time with them last night and earlier today at the Empire State Building, which will once again brighten up the skyline with WNBA orange tonight. This is a great group of young women. I also spent some time with their parents last night and today and with their families. I'm so excited to see what they will all bring to this league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Speaking of the 2024 draft class, I would be remiss not to mention the incredible excitement and energy for women's basketball that this group has helped build. Just last week, many of those here with us played in front of the largest broadcast audience in history The national championship peaked at 24 million viewers and was ESPN platforms most-viewed college basketball game, men's or women's, on record. Incredible."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,It's so clear that this draft class is entering the WNBA at an incredible time. We are witnessing a transformational moment in sports that we may not experience for generations.

Our sport has never been stronger on the court.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I for one feel incredibly blessed to be part of it and to lead the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the United States that is leading the charge for women's sports. This is a league where -- you all know that cover us year-round -- the talent is exceptional, the rivalries are intense and where you tune in to watch a lot of games of consequence."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We are ready for this moment. We're coming off a record-breaking season that saw the WNBA reach milestones in viewership, fan engagement, attendance, social media and digital engagement on the WNBA app and website. For the second year in a row, we'll be hosting a preseason game in Canada. This year, the L.A. Sparks and the Seattle Storm will face off at Rogers Place in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, on May 5. We air games in over 200 countries and territories. Games like our Canada game show how the league is continuing to expand its global footprint."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The fourth annual Commissioner's Cup will return this time with a new format that we are very excited about. Just remember, this is our fourth annual. Each team will play five Commissioner's Cup games, one against each of its in-conference rivals, all during a two-week period at the beginning of June. The players will compete for a half-million-dollar prize pool, and the league will once again be donating to all of the teams' designated not-for-profit community organizations."

Our partners have shown that they have stepped up for the WNBA, and we are extremely thankful and fortunate to work with brands that are so excited to be a part of moving the league forward. We were just on stage with the State Farm executives who are here in full force as our presenting partner tonight."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Over the past few weeks and months we've announced several partnerships, including with Opill, SKIMS, Peloton, La Crema, Tissot. I've got my Tissot watch on here. We've also renewed partnerships with brands, including Glossier and Amazon, and CBS as media partners."

We look forward to adding more, including another one to be announced as we tip off this season."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our partners are committed to supporting women's sports. We're seeing the work of our broadcast and streaming partners, especially ESPN and ABC. If you build it, they will come. We just proved that in March Madness, and we'll bring that into the WNBA season."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're bringing games to fans where they are, whether they're on national networks, ESPN, ABC, ION, which was our over-the-air partner that we signed last year, streaming on Amazon Prime, ESPN or on our own WNBA League Pass, which last year saw milestone growth for the league. And we're hoping to repeat that this year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The growth and demand for the WNBA had led us to expansion, something that I know you all want to hear about. I've been very excited, as you all know. We announced a team in the Bay Area, with the Golden State Warriors coming in the '25 season. So one year from today, they will be here making a pick. With more news to come in the coming weeks and months on other potential markets to join in 2026 and beyond."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That brings me to women's basketball is not a fad. We've been steadily building this momentum for years, and we are ready for what's next."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Lastly, I have been very reflective over the past couple weeks with all the hype and talk about this draft class and the WNBA. Surviving the existential time of the WNBA wubble, raising that 75 million in capital in February of 2022 as the first women's sports league to do so at that scale, deploying it against our key priorities. Almost as if we knew we had to be ready for this moment, and we are."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, thank you again for all your support. To those that have covered us over time, we thank you for your coverage. And for those of you that are new, to quote from our ad campaign, welcome to the W. We hope you stay."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The WNBA Draft will get started soon, and I'm happy to answer any questions. I really, again, appreciate the coverage. This is what helps grow our sport, and I know many of you have been with us a long time, through our 27th and soon to be 28th season, and we really do appreciate that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, we'll start our QA portion."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I'll answer the latter first. As many of you know, we already announced that we are providing charter to our players through our full Playoffs, Commissioner's Cup and also the back-to-backs requiring air travel. Why that's important is this year there are a lot more back-to-backs requiring air travel because it's an Olympic year and we have an Olympic break. So we funded out of the league a 4 million fund to fund charter for this year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, as we build the momentum and build the economic model to fund that longer term, there's nobody that wants that more than I do for these players, but we have to be in the right financial position. We're not going to jeopardize the financial viability of this league. It was just a few years ago we were surviving, and now we're going from survive to thrive. So we'll do it at the appropriate time, and we've been chipping away at it every year and adding additional charter flights for the players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Media deal. So speaking of better travel, better pay and all that, sports, especially at league levels, you have two main revenue streams. One is your media rights, and the other is corporate partnerships. We've been really making great progress with the corporate partnership side. On the media side, I think women's media rights have been undervalued for so many years, just a microcosm by the way of the broader world that I came from before I came here. So I think it's really important that we're doing everything we can."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is an important year for us around viewership, around attendance, around all the qualitative and quantitative factors that go into the valuation of media rights, because as I've said to my team, there's not a day that we're not -- if we're not working on things that feed into the valuation of our next media rights, we're not focused on the right things."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is a really important focus for us. Our current deals go through the '25 season. So through October of '25. We do have some time, but we're gearing up for a combination of what that media rights package would look like."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you know, the media landscape continues to be enormously disrupted, with household and people using TV levels down, with obviously cord cutting, with streaming, with over-the-air. Obviously, there's a lot going on subscription-wise, cable. So we're looking at all of that disruption and determining what is the best deals with partners for the WNBA, including, again, traditional linear, streaming and over-the-air."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So first, our plan and goal is to get to 16 teams in the next few years. We're at 13 with the Golden State team. Our plan is to get three more in the next few years."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're talking to a lot of different cities. I think I've thrown out names before. It's complex because you need arena and practice facility and player housing and all the things, you need committed long-term ownership groups. The nice thing is we're getting a lot of calls."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We continue to engage with cities. I'll throw some of those out there because I've already thrown them out there. We continue to engage with cities like Philadelphia and Toronto, and Portland and Denver and Nashville and South Florida and probably forgetting one, but those are the cities we're talking to. But just last week we got calls from two other cities. These can either take a very long time to negotiate or can happen pretty quickly if you find the right ownership group with the right arena situation."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're on our way to 16. That will add 48 roster spots in just a couple of years. That, in a league of 144, is a lot. That's 30 percent. I think it'll be great when we get those done over the next couple years."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"'26 is definitely our goal for certainly the next one, and then shortly thereafter, if not then, or a year or two after. So by '28, I'd say I'd feel pretty confident we'll be at 16 teams."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Expansion draft, again, we're not going to share exact details on the expansion draft today. But it'll happen this year, this calendar year, so probably in December because it has to happen before the college draft. That expansion draft, we'll share more details as we get closer to that. We've been talking with our general managers and head coaches and the teams and the owners, so more to come on that. But there will be an expansion draft this year, and it'll probably be in December."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think what's important is there's a reason the WNBA is the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the country, and it's because the NBA has been such a great partner in launching this league, building this league and investing in this league. So to the extent it makes sense, I think what I heard Adam say, but to the extent it made sense to go to market together, that's what we'll do."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think as you look at streamers who have a subscription model, the WNBA gives the NBA longer programming across the year. I think Adam uses the quote of 320 I actually think it's more days. And there's no other set of two sports leagues that can offer that live programming and sports to a streamer like that. I would say probably in that case we need the NBA because we have a smaller footprint with only 40 games, and it's nice to go to market together."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So where it makes sense to go together, we will. Where it makes sense -- so we have our own deals today that the NBA doesn't have, with Amazon, with CBS and with ION. So where it makes sense not to, we'll evaluate that and work with Adam and his team on that. We're just excited that we have a lot of interest from a lot of media partners in the W. We've got to deliver an amazing season this year in order to get, I think, the right-sized valuation."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think everybody is watching those teams that are investing in the player experience. I'll call it more -- because it is more broad than just practice facility. There's a variety of things in player experience that can attract a player in free agency. And quite frankly, off of our 2020 very progressive and historic collective bargaining agreement, free agency opened up, as you've seen, some really interesting years of free agency that we didn't used to have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think you see that investment. You'll see it pay off. I think there are other owners looking at the exact same thing. We have situations where, again, we have NBA-affiliated teams who already have great practice facilities."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think everybody is looking for an advantage to bring in free agents, because the one thing I know these long-term committed owners in the W are, they want to win a championship. I think practice facilities and other player experience have become very important as you seek free agents in the marketplace."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"See, we're a pretty good vault here at the WNBA. I'm not going to comment on any specific ownership group. We've had several ownership groups in several cities reach out to us. Sometimes in a city, two different ownership groups reach out. Again, we evaluate them through our process. We also evaluate the city, the demographic, the psychographic. That is my hometown, so I happen to know more about that. But we've done a big data exercise in research."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,No specific comment on that specific city other than it's certainly on the list. I think it's a great basketball city. We'll continue to discuss it with ownership groups there that are interested in committing long term to the W.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, the one thing in sports, at the league level we love to bring in these corporate partners because then they can support our players across all of our teams. We've been able to establish that with our current WNBA Changemakers and other partners that aren't Changemakers. We upsell to Changemakers, like we did with CarMax. They were a partner, not a Changemaker, and they came to us and said we want to support the W in a bigger way. So we were able to upsell them, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"There are some open categories we have in a variety of categories. That's how we target who we want to be partners. But we also look at a values match. We also look at -- relationships matter, too. If we have relationships with the CEO or the CMO or someone in the C-suite, that's an important part because then you can turn that into a corporate partnership."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"One of the things that's great about being in the WNBA right now is everybody is paying attention. I ran into someone who ran an ad buy during the final of the women's Final Four. They said -- it was a CEO they got thousands of messages, not only about how great they thought the ad was but that they ran it during women's basketball, and how much that lifted their brand with not just their female employees but their female customers and everybody."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, I think with eyes on the game increasing at historic levels, obviously betting is not legal in every state. Integrity is No. 1 for us, so obviously we do a lot in that area. But certainly from a perspective of bringing in a fan base that might not have been in the WNBA before. We've had plenty of betting on WNBA in past years, but obviously I think FanDuel or one of the betting companies released a statistic about that LSU-Iowa game in the Elite Eight, and it was one of the highest bet games they had seen. I hadn't seen the data post that for the Final Four and the final game, but I'm sure a lot of people are paying attention, transcending age, race, gender from that perspective."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That's what these WNBA players coming into this Draft tonight are going to do for us, and I think the attention and the views and bringing in another part of a fan base that might not have watched women's basketball before and now are following these household names."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The one thing I know about sports, you need household names, rivalries and games of consequence. Those are the three things we've had over the past couple weeks, and hopefully will continue into the WNBA season. Certainly sports betting is something that attracts fans in."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we need to work on this idea of watch and bet versus bet and watch because if you bet, maybe you don't watch, but if you watch and then bet, yeah, then you're probably bringing in a fan base we haven't had before."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Integrity first. Obviously, it's not legal in every state in the U.S.. But as we start to see that -- and betting partners are supporting our teams, as well, in corporate sponsorships. So I think again, it's an important way to grow our viewership."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that -- that's why I started to answer this question with the integrity of the game is No. 1. It will remain No. 1 no matter how the handles grow and things like that. But people are going to bet on our sport, and we do a ton of training from the league, the team perspective. The Players Association I know has a rules of the road around this. I think it is really important."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I was actually talking to the players last night, and I said I learned one thing when I was the CEO of Deloitte about juggling four things in life your work, your health, your family and your integrity. I said, when you juggle those balls, three of those balls are glass and if you drop them, they break, and those are family, health and integrity. The work ball is rubber. You can mess up and recover. But those three balls, so the integrity I think it's really important that the players understand they're big brands with big followership, more than any players have had coming into the league because of the popularity of the women's game at the NCAA level, and how important is integrity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's accomplished by training. Do I worry about things like that? Sure, and everybody should in sports. But I do think it's happening around us, and if we're not cognizant of what's going on and how that can benefit the viewership of the league and things like that, so we don't want to leave that on the table, but we want to do it in the right way with the right guardrails around integrity. We have not, to my knowledge, had issues on that, but we'll continue to monitor it for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, so obviously one of our focuses this year of our social justice council is reproductive rights, as well as civic engagement, given that we're in a general election year. So the one thing I like about our players, our players want to be engaged. They don't run away from things. They want to be engaged and they want to force change in the communities in which they live and work, and they do it very, very effectively. I think on this issue they'll continue to do that effectively."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously we have a team there, as well, and in other states, but they'll continue to make their impact on this particular issue, maternal health, reproductive rights. Actually, the charities that we'll be donating to as part of the Commissioner's Cup will be charities in that space, and the players, again, will use their voice because they know if they use their voice, change will happen for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we'll just continue to obviously monitor. You're right, we decide on All-Stars now a year in advance. We're getting better at that. Therefore, we made this decision a year ago."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll continue to monitor the situation there, but our players won't run away from it. They'll want to help change and effect change, and we'll use our platform and their platform to do just that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so it is great to actually inherit, I'll call it. Quite frankly, again, we didn't do what we did in the bubble in 2020 to have a season, which is existential for us, I'm not sure we're at this moment with these household names coming into our league, because there might have been nowhere to play had we been out of the sports landscape for 20 months. We certainly wouldn't have the momentum we all have in women's basketball and are enjoying."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I'm thrilled that we have household names coming in. We need to market around that. In fact, one of the things we did for the first time ever was we did a media ad buy from the Sweet 16 into the final for the WNBA. You might have seen them. I have a prop with me today. Rookie-O's. Arike was in one of the commercials and Stewie was in another, and we had another one predicting when the rookies come in."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I thought it was clever, and Arike and Stewie did an amazing job. But this was an investment in bringing that NCAA viewer into the WNBA, and we hadn't done it before."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I know just from my circles in life, hearing people who are all talking about the WNBA, that we're going to be successful in that. But it is about marketing, so deployment of that capital in the marketing area. We've increased our marketing budget significantly for this year to capture just that, and I think we're already seeing the returns on that. We had 98 percent positive sentiment on this ad campaign. I mean, that's the W. Ninety-eight percent positive. We're really excited about that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So those are the types of things, but we have a variety of other things. You might have seen some that were at the NBA All-Star Game, how we stood up activations there, and Sabrina-Steph in the three-point competition obviously was a highlight of that weekend. Just continuing to have our player marketing agreement players that we're paying in the offseason to market on behalf of the W. We've got Aliyah Boston here today doing a lot of -- she obviously did an amazing job, I thought, on broadcast during the NCAA Tournament, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're trying a lot of different things now that we have some of that financial capital and human capital, because you need human capital, too, to grow. So we've been able to hire a lot of people in our marketing group, and we had very few when I came in. We have a Chief Marketing Officer now and we have the power of the NBA brand, too, helping us market."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,It's all shaping up to continue to take these household names and build new household names.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, we continue to look at the data that comes through and where there's anomalies or unusual -- again, this year is going to be an unusual year overall because of our footprint with an Olympic break, about a three-week Olympic break. But I think next year we'll have a great footprint. We've continued to look at the data around injuries and the hardship system and things like that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We also continue to look at where the 10, 11, 12 players on our rosters fall as far as playing time and things like that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll continue to take a look at it. I think for now, the roster spots are going to remain at 12. But again, as I said, we're going to add 48 roster spots in probably a three-year period or so, and that's a lot. So we'll give a lot more -- I thought you were going to ask me because my goal is we have -- we need to give these players a lot more opportunities to play at the professional level, and that's what growth is. That's what's going to fund the growth, whether you talk about revenue, media deals, corporate partners, the more cities you're in. Again, longest-tenured league, 330 million people in this country, not enough to be in 12, so now we have 13, on our way to 16, and I think we can do even more after that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think that's the way to add these roster spots for purposes of the game, as we've looked at the data. But we continue to monitor that for sure and talk with our players quite frankly about it, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, I just want to thank you all. Again, for those that are new to this league, watch, rep, buy, attend. It's an amazing game on the court, and I probably wouldn't have taken this job if it wasn't. I really appreciate all your support. Thank you. Enjoy tonight."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"For the first question, the moment, man, it was the moment for me. Right before the Commissioner said my name, I just looked down and thought to myself and said a little prayer, like it's your time, it's God's timing. She said my name, and that's when the water works started happening. Just super grateful for this moment and this opportunity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Your second question with Shakira, great player. Followed her from D-I all the way to the W. I think I'm just happy to really get the opportunity to play alongside her. Such a great player. I think that she's going to elevate me. I can elevate her, too. But whatever impact I can take for this team and to this organization."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Very rewarding, and I think one of the things going into this league that I want to do is just expand my game. Might be asked to play a different role, but I'm open to it. I see myself as a versatile player and impacting in any position that I'm asked to play in."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Yeah, it's going to be a tough league, tough first year, but I'm pumped and I'm ready for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's been a lot. Long days, a lot of long days. But once I hit the weekend, once I was with my fellow draftees, that's when I started really sinking in the moment and just being appreciative for being a part of this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"The W is the W, and it's a great league. I'm just super excited to be a part of it, but the process is no joke, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, just to have a dream like this and to actually walk through it, I said this out there, it's just amazing. A lot of people have dreams, but a lot of people aren't able to achieve it. For me to be fortunate enough to say that and to keep going and to keep pushing my dreams, it's just amazing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"I would say my message for the younger girls is just be confident, be who you are, but know your worth. I mean, coming from Canada, wasn't given as many opportunities as, say, my fellow draftees, but I made the best out of it, and I earned everything that I was given. Stay humble but let them know."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's great. The Bleed Blue bleeds all the way into the league. I'm just very fortunate to be given the opportunity to go to UConn and spend my four years there, but especially spend my four years there with Nika. We had a hug when my name was called. It's just a lot because the people and the relationships you build over this beautiful game that we play, it's amazing, and to share this moment with her and Coach and CD Chris Dailey and J Jamelle Elliott and Mo Morgan Valley, and Paige and Azzi were in the audience, too, it's a family. I'm hoping to make a new family in D.C."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"It feels great. I feel like the platform that I was given, even though at first I wasn't really sure that I was able to step into it, but I've had to step into it. I've had to kind of live in my truth because I know that a lot of young girls are looking up to me and a lot of people who are inspired to be like me are watching. You're not only playing for yourself, you're playing for those following behind you, and you're also playing for those who laid the groundwork in front of you."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Coming into the W, I respect that. I appreciate, I'm not going to say elders because I don't want them getting on me, but I appreciate our vets, and I'm going to soak up all the experience, but also knowing that I have a huge impact across the border in Canada and across the border in Asia, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say what excites me the most is coming into this Liberty team and learning from the vets that are there, and just going in and continuing to grow."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,I would say something that stood out to me is them looking basically for a two-way player and me being just that. So knowing that I can come in and be a two-way player and make an impact that way is something that I look forward to.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I approach being on a team like that, just coming in each and every day, just getting in the gym and putting in that work to be able to do what those expectations are and just coming in and being ready."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say that makes it a little bit easier. Just coming in and having a certain role and knowing what's expected of you and knowing that you don't have to be the superhero or anything like that. So I would say that that would definitely make it a lot better or -- well, yeah, coming in, learning from those vets."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I'm very excited to work with her and just learn from her and take whatever I can take from her and take it to my game. I would say just being able to score in different ways, that's a way that I can come in and help the Liberty."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is definitely my passing. I think that's at times what gets overlooked in my game. I think the scoring and the long shots is what everybody falls in love with. Then obviously going to an organization that has, in my eyes, one of the best post players in the entire world. My point guard eyes just light up at that. And obviously, Aliyah has been one of my teammates before. I'm excited. I can't wait."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, I don't really feel like I have a rival. I think the biggest thing is the WNBA is so competitive right now. Every single time you step on the floor, it's going to be a rivalry. I think so many teams are loaded with so much talent. This is the most competitive league in the entire world. Less than 144 spots."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"So you'd better bring it every single night, and I think that's exactly what I'm going to do. But I think that's exactly how I lived my college career, too, is every single game, no matter what the opponent was I prepped the exact same way, I prepared the same way, I brought the same fire, I brought the same energy. I think that's the biggest thing going into my WNBA career."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is I vividly remember Coach Bluder during my home visit in my recruiting. It was at the end of my junior year, I believe, or maybe the beginning of my junior year. Sometime during my junior year. I think the biggest thing is we talked about this moment, we dreamed of this moment, but she also believed I would be here and she coached me really hard to get to this moment."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"There was a lot of ups and downs. Something I really appreciated about Coach Bluder is no matter what awards or success or wins we ever had or I had, it's like she never stopped coaching me, she never stopped holding me accountable. She always thought there was ways for me to get better. She still thinks that, and I still think that. That's one of the things I just love about her. First of all, she believed I would be here from the day I committed to her, even before that when I was in eighth grade, but also she pushed me really hard to make me as good as I am."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Definitely Aliyah Boston. Come on now. I think also Erica Wheeler. A vet, somebody that has been in the league a long time, somebody that is in the organization, has been in the league, understands what it's about, somebody that I can lean on. I'm 22 years old, and I don't have all the answers in the world. This is something new to me. This is a new challenge. That's something I'm excited for. But having those type of people around me to lean on and ask questions, or when things get hard, to be there for me. I think those two, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think obviously the course of the last few weeks has been pretty insane in my life, the last two months playing basketball as long as I possibly could in my college career, and then went home for a couple days. I got off the plane when we landed in Iowa City, drove directly home, had cook my mom cook me a meal, and then I drove back to Iowa City the next day. We had our celebration, and then I flew to L.A., flew to New York and now I'm here sitting at this stage."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is I'm just very lucky to be in this moment, and all these opportunities and these things, they're once in a lifetime. When things might get tiring or you have to do stuff, I think the biggest thing is look at it just as an opportunity. This isn't something everybody gets to do. It's once in a lifetime, and just trying to soak in every single experience because I know how quick of a turnaround it is, and I have a lot of people helping me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Then obviously Aliyah Boston, there's so much you can say about her. Rookie of the Year. In my eyes, one of the best players in the league. Like I said, as a point guard, my biggest job is I'm just feeding Aliyah the ball every single day. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be in there and be like, go make a layup. She's going to make my life easy."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"She's incredible. But the thing I love about her is she's a great person. She loves the game, she knows the game, she supports the game and she has a smile that affects a lot of people and brings a lot of joy to people when they watch her. I can't wait to be her teammate again."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, if I'm being completely honest, I feel like it doesn't change a ton from how I lived my life over the course of the last year. Sponsorships stay the same. The people around me, agents and whatnot, have been able to help me and guide me through the course of the last year. I don't know if I would be in this moment if it wasn't for a lot of them. My mom has done a lot, my dad has done a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think that's just the biggest thing. The advice I would say is just lean on the people around you. I don't have to do every single thing. I think at the same time, in college I always said my main focus is on basketball. That's why I've had every other opportunity in my life is because of the way I carry myself, the way I play the game. Going into my professional career, I plan to do the exact same thing. My focus is solely on basketball, being the best I can."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I don't have to do school anymore. That's pretty exciting. I do have to get my degree. I graduate on May 14th. Other than that, my 110 percent focus is on basketball, and when I do that really well and carry myself really well, everything just kind of takes care of itself."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely. I'm actually an executive producer on the show, which has been kind of fun for myself. When Peyton Manning reached out, obviously it's his production company, I was a little skeptical at first, but I was like, I don't know if I really want to let people into my life like that. I've never really done it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"But the way this year has unfolded, the way obviously Kamilla and Kiki, the seasons that they had, you can't script it any better. It's been absolutely incredible for women's basketball. If you're a women's basketball fan or you're not a women's basketball fan, I encourage you to watch the show when it comes out. I've seen bits and pieces. It's absolutely amazing. It really allows you to understand the student-athlete for way more than just a basketball player, and I think that's really important. I think that's going to allow fans of the W, fans of college to really understand what they go through, but love them even more for who they are and what they do and what they're about."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I'm excited for everybody to see it, and it's been a special project."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely, and that's definitely our goal is to get back to championship habits. I think it's so cool for me. I vividly remember my freshman year during the bubble, we played Kentucky in the round of 32 and Tamika was calling the game and I was like tweaking out. I couldn't believe she was calling one of my games. Somebody I idolized, somebody that I loved and somebody that is not only a great basketball player and everything that she did but she's a tremendous person."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think that speaks to the organization as a whole, and everything that they do is so first class. I'm very lucky to be going there to an organization that really loves women's basketball. You see it today, I think they had 17,000 tickets claimed to just watch the draft. I think that shows the excitement in Indianapolis. It's a great basketball city. Obviously, what the Pacers have been able to do this year is special, in the Playoffs. I think I'm just excited."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Like you said, there's a lot of young talent on the team, and just getting back to the Playoffs and doing everything we can to win a lot of basketball games is certainly the goal."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, honestly, I feel like this was definitely a little bit more emotional for me. I think that's because when you're in the heat of competition, you don't have time to really feel your emotions. You're so competitive and you're so fiery, you're not really worried about all that. I think that was the biggest thing through my career is, first of all, I was able to have a lot of closure in the way my career ended and everything I was able to do. Obviously, I played the maximum number of games I could play my senior year. Obviously, we didn't win, but you feel like you did everything you can to be in that moment and compete as hard as you can."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"But when you're kind of just sitting at a table waiting for your name to be called, I think that really allows the emotions to feed you and you're with your family. Obviously, playing a basketball game, I'm not out there with my family. So sharing that moment with them and enjoying it, and people that have really had my back and believed in me more than anyone, is super special."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"Well, I know the Indiana Hoosiers didn't love me too much during my career, but hopefully we can turn a lot of them into Fever fans, if they're not already."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"I think going to a state that supports not only basketball but women's basketball, going and playing in front of -- at Indiana, the place is sold out. Doing the same for the Fever is certainly our goal, and having a lot of fans there every single night."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAITLIN CLARK,"For myself, I can't imagine a more perfect fit, a better place for me to start my professional career, an organization that really just believes in women's basketball and wants to do everything the right way. So I couldn't be more excited to get there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It means the most to me. Just tells me that I'm going to be in good hands, and I'm just excited to get there and get to work with her."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,It's been an amazing day. It was my first time over there. Just a nice view.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Getting my hair done and my makeup done was also amazing. Getting here, getting drafted was amazing. It's just been a really special moment for me, and everything is going just like I dreamt of."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I would say just getting in the league and bringing my winning leadership, my winning mentality. We won two national championships, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Just getting better, being more physical, more competition. I'm just excited to get out there and play with some of the big names of women's basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that was the dream, but honestly, no, I didn't really expect this. I'm just so proud that I am here right now. I know little Kamilla, when I was 13 years old, is also proud. I'm just excited to be here and happy."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,It's been a crazy couple of days. I'm just so proud of my teammates for winning the national championship. I'm just so happy to be here.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I got really emotional because the main goal was to get here and being able to give my family a better life, and just by looking at them and seeing them at my table was amazing. I obviously get emotional when I talk about my family because I'm so proud of everything I was able to accomplish and do for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,I think it's going to be great. She's a great player. I'm a great player. So two great players together. Nobody is going to get no rebounds on us.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,This is actually going to be my first time in Chicago. I'm really excited. I've heard really good things about it. You have some of the best pizzas. I'm excited to get there.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I would like to go play overseas somewhere. I think that gets you better. Every time I played for my national team, it got me better somehow. So I'm excited to go to the WNBA and be able to play overseas somewhere."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that tells you a lot about Coach Staley. She gets you ready for this level. She gets you prepared for whenever you step to the next level, and like I said, that just tells you everything about her. She gets you super prepared for the league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I don't know, I'm just excited to get there, get to work, learn from the best and just step up my game. Step my game up."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"My main goal as a WNBA player is just to step my game, being a sponge, soaking in everything from everybody, learn each and every day, and be a better version of myself each and every day. Be open to learning new stuff and stay ready."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,My conversations with them have been amazing. I'm all about energy. She has a great energy. He has a great energy. I'm just excited to get there and get to work with them.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"And about specific to me, I'm just excited to meet the whole team."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,I'm happy. I'm really excited. She's a great player. I'm a great player. I think we're going to do great things together.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I love that I get to stay on the West Coast, and I love that they took a chance on me, and I feel like I'm just going to show that I can work really hard and help them a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But also, I'll be close to family, which is really important for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"That's a good question. I would say I just want to continue the legacy of growing the sport, and I feel like I've said this a lot today, but we really have to look back at the women before us, and I know people keep saying this is a historic draft class but there were many, many talented draft classes before us."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I just want to give my props to the Dawn Staleys, Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslies because they are why I'm here, because I watched them growing up. I just hope that I can continue that legacy for younger girls."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"So growing up, I said this earlier before, as well, but growing up, I was kind of first introduced to the league because my mom was a product line manager at Nike and worked on Dawn Staley's signature shoe and worked with Tamika Catchings and Jen Rizzotti, who I've played 3-on-3 basketball for."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Growing up I had so much admiration for these women. It was really upsetting to not see that reciprocated by the public, what you see on social media, and I always do think the negative stands out more than the positive unfortunately, but it was really upsetting for me, and there were a lot of times where I was just kind of dumbfounded by the negativity."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I think now there's a positive switch, and hopefully we can just keep that momentum going."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Yeah, so I studied communications at Stanford, and my parents both worked for Nike for 20-plus years, grew up in Beaverton. That's where the world headquarters are, so I'm definitely a Nike kid born and raised."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But New Balance came to me with -- I see you're wearing New Balances, by the way. I love it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Yes, to answer your first question, I think in these situations it's a business now, and you never know. I had great conversations with the Sparks and Raegan Pebley and Curt, and they're amazing, but you just never know, and I didn't want to assume anything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"It's just such a high-stress environment, as well, so when they called my name, just a huge wave of emotions hit me. When I saw my mom tearing up and my dad, that definitely hit home. Just was super thankful."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Actually, I actually FaceTimed Steph like five minutes before the show started. He just said to just have fun with it. I think he can just share so much great advice because obviously he's been through this, and he just said to make stuff like this fun because it can be stressful. So to make it fun. He answered my mom's FaceTime call. I called Seth Curry, as well. He hung up immediately because that's Seth. But then he called back right after."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"Yeah, they're both just great sounding boards for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I specifically remember playing against Australia I think U-16 or U-17 it was, and honestly they're some of the strongest people I've ever played against. When they hit you with a screen, it takes you a while to recover. And Lauren Jackson is one of my favorite players ever. I just really admire her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Do you want to ask Cheryl or me? They turned up the pressure. It's the end of the game. Of course we are both trying to win. They turned up the pressure and we got a couple turnovers. We didn't execute our offensive plays at the end, so that's what their defense was doing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I saw a very physical and aggressive New York team. We know this from being a part of the game for so long that sometimes you get away with this stuff when you're physical and aggressive, and they certainly did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,It's a shame that officiating had such a hand in a series like this. Obviously there's always going to be a team that's going to be a little more disappointed than the other.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I thought today was incredibly disappointing. The challenge -- we have got to change our challenge rules. The officials doing the game should have a third party, because that was not a foul. That call should have been reversed on that challenge. If we sent that clip in -- well, first of all, Napheesa Collier, the number of times she was held, et cetera, there was nothing down on that end. For whatever reason in this series, that's kind of the way it was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"At the other end, when we challenged it, if we would have turned that clip in, they would have told us that it was marginal contact, no foul. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. So when you review, those should be the same parameters that you're reviewing with. But the three people on the game need a third party to let them know. Because that decided the game. That decided the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"You watched the whole series, right? What makes her difficult is you're spending a lot of time guarding Sabrina and Stewie. In some of those schemes, it created mismatches. But we were going to live with some of that. We knew that JJ was going to score. These guys shot 30 percent. Shot 30 percent. The difference was in the foul line."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Obviously we needed to execute better on offense I think one of these guys said that. We had opportunities not to fuel them. But we knew they were coming. We just needed -- our lead guard spot was obviously rough for us tonight. We get a little bit decent play out of there, we win the game. But with all that happened, we still almost put ourselves in position to do this. I hurt for our players. I really, really hurt. They are an incredibly special group."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think that was kind of the end-of-quarter situation. We were up 12. It was 32-20. We allowed them to come back to get it to within seven or something like that going into the half. That's where we have to be better. That's been throughout the series, too, that end of quarters and things like that. It's hard when you're playing a team at home, a team that knows each other well and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"It's hard to just pick one thing, you know what I'm saying, when you still have a chance to win the game. I think, yeah, we could have executed better, but there were so many things that went on throughout the game that we still gave ourselves a chance to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"It's been the same. Game 5, everybody is making their adjustments, mid-game, mid-possession. We are flying around. Everybody knows each other so well at this point. Everybody is trying to make a play and stop them from making a play. They made some plays in the second half."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,We talked about handling their pressure.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Handling the pressure, executing our offense, not turning the ball over to let them get energy in transition and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, probably because I was getting held a little bit. It was a little hard to make shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"No, I think, you know, of course, like they said, everyone is trying to make adjustments in the second half. I got a lot of shots up in the first. I was making a lot, so they tightened up their defense, brought people in rotation, were doubling, things like that. They were upping the pressure and it got harder."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I shared with them exactly what you said. Incredibly proud that since the day we got together in training camp all the way through to the end, we were the same team. We never got the disease of ""me."" Not one single player on the team got the disease of ""me,"" not one. Those that were maybe in the rotation, fell out of the rotation, some that never got to play, no one ever put themselves first, no one. That is incredibly difficult to find in this day and age."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm really, really proud, incredibly proud of the number of people that were impacted by Lynx basketball and how excited they are to watch their team play. I told them, it's who they are as people and how they did it. So those are things we talked about. I wouldn't trade them for anyone. Anyone. Any team. Do things the right way. Built the team within the rules. Those sort of things that maybe right now aren't happening in our league. And did it the hard way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"You know what, we gave hope to those teams that aren't willing to circumvent the cap or fly illegally or all the stuff that's happened over the last five years. Do it the right way gives hope for those other teams that you can build a team just like ours. You don't have to have a super team. You don't have to have that. There's a different way to do it. So I'm incredibly proud of them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, it's really rare. Saying that this is my 11th season, and I get to go out to fight with women that I consider sisters, that's why it feels the way it does. Every single day we came to work, we enjoyed being with each other, competing with each other, fighting for each other, and that's why we're here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"That's why we gave ourselves a chance to compete for a championship, because we showed up every day and did it the right way and did it for each other. That's really rare in this league. The way that it's happening and all this other bulls--- that people make seem like it's important, it's not."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Obviously the exclamation point to the incredible season that she had. You know, Napheesa showed up big time for this team. Put us in a position to be within seconds of a championship. Phee was phenomenal."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I'm always so in awe of Phee because she carries it with such grace. She carries it her own way. As a superstar in this league, it can become about something else. But she always keeps it about the team and always keeps it about winning and continuing to get better and better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I'm always in awe of her. Every time she steps on the court and the way she carries herself and no matter what's going on, she's so consistent. That comes from her. That's her internal -- amazing. We just have so much confidence in who she is on and off the court. I'm lucky to be alongside of her. I'm just in awe. She's had an amazing season and amazing postseason obviously. Can't wait to see what she does in the future."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"That's what's coming. I think greater recognition, that's what's coming. Phee has earned every bit of it. Like you said, still, the season she's had, it's not Phee that you're hearing about. It's other players. But I think Phee has earned it. We'll see going into next season if maybe she'll be a little bit more a face of the league."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Well, that's really loaded. It's a lot for me to think about right now, forgive me. I really don't have an answer for that. That's just pretty deep for me. And plus, there's proprietary secrets."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"No, she was tremendous in the playoffs. Really gave them a lift every single time she got minutes. Not surprised. They went big."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"It's crazy how the series ended. For four games, it was about the three ball, three ball, three ball. Certainly offensive rebounds throughout the whole thing. But then tonight came down to points in the paint. We don't even score in the paint and we had 44, was it, right. So it was really interesting how the series ended with them playing bigger. They won the game with their defense, no doubt about it, with their defense. Anyway, to your question, her minutes were really good, really helped them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"I know all the headlines will be ""Reeve Cries Foul."" Bring it on. Bring it on. Because this s--- was stolen from us. Bring it on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"We talked about it. We know we could have done some things, but you shouldn't have to overcome to that extent. This s--- ain't that hard. Officiating, it's not that hard. When someone is being held, be consistent. If you don't want to call it a hold at one end, don't call it at the other. Be consistent. Every team asks for that. Sandy asked for that last game. Three of the games in this series, we're talking about the same damn thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"So I tell these guys, for whatever reason, it didn't work out. It just doesn't feel right that you lose a series with that level of discrepancy. We don't have a team that whines and complains and all that stuff. Sometimes it probably hurts us. Maybe being a little more, I don't know, something. But you have a star player like Phee, that just, I don't get it. I don't get how she can be held and go to the basket and get hit, and then a marginal, at best, at best, sends their best player to the free throw line. I mean, that's tough. It's tough to swallow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Just like our 2016 championship that was lost -- officiating, missing a shot clock violation. This sucks. This is for a championship for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams. This isn't that hard."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"So it's disappointing. I mean, congratulations to the Liberty on their first championship. Been around, I don't know, how long has the league been around? 28 years? It took them 28 years. Congrats to them. We were that close to our fifth. Just didn't happen."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"It's disappointing. It's incredibly disappointing. But these guys, I mean, they've got to try to pick themselves up and go, ""We were that damn close."" It hurts. It hurts."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I've been like manifesting this moment for a while. And there's no feeling like it. You know, this game, and credit to Minnesota, because they gave us a tough series. The fans have been amazing everywhere we've gone. But to be able to bring a championship to New York, first ever in franchise history, it's an incredible feeling. I literally can't wait to continue to celebrate with the city because I know it's going to like, be bonkers. Bonkers. Fact, right."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I came in with a game plan of like, it doesn't matter. I want to play defense. I want to rebound. I want to do the little things, and I'll continue to be aggressive and shoot my shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But if they are not falling, they are not falling. I'm not going to let that affect the way I do things. So continuing to be there for my team. I didn't talk about this, but before I made the free throws, I missed two free throws. I was like, no, I can't do this again, I can't. I have to be here. Olaf Lange, him and I have talked about being a python, where it's like you know your moment when to strike. At that moment, I was just thinking about being a python."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,Good job. You were. Like it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Be a python.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"JJ can come sit up here, JJ. Let's go, MVP."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I thought they were pretty fair laughter. I mean, the last game, that's where you get give and take. Game No. 1, we should have won that game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I have so much respect for Cheryl, and I have so much respect for that Minnesota Lynx team, because man, that was ugly. But we found a way to win. I'm really proud of our team, how resilient we were, how we stuck together and how we continue to trust each other. That was our word today, just trust the process. We found a way to win. Then going back to Stewie, she did miss two free throws, which is rare for her. But in that five seconds to go, she said, ""I'm going to make 'em."" I'm like, good. I was praying laughter, but it worked."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'll start here. It's been 10 years, so a decade. I was due one. The last three or four, been runners-up, bridesmaid."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It feels good. Now, it's a little bit different, because back then we were so dominant in Phoenix. We got through Minnesota Lynx in the semifinals and then it was 3-0 against Chicago and only the last game was tight when BG was out."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"This has been a grind every single game. There's things we could have done better, too. But we never strayed away from who we are as a team. I never strayed away from who I am as a coach."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think I just love these ladies here. They are amazing humans. They are fun to coach. But it's the same feeling. That was a great team, a very connected team, and so is this team. That's what I've said in the media a lot, haven't I. I said this feels like the 2014 team that I have coached. I'm just so happy, for everyone, this organization, but particularly these players, that we win today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"I don't know if they are bragging rights. It's for my whole family, basically, specifically Satou. She's been with me every step of the way and has been in my corner through my ups and downs, and I've had a lot of downs in my career. This ring is for her as much as it is for me."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"For me, I'm happy. Just really happy and trying to take in the moment and enjoy every aspect of it. I'm just up here smiling and thanking Jesus and thanking my teammates. Yeah, just enjoying the moment."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No, I prepared her at halftime. I just felt, going with a bigger lineup, I said, okay, be ready, we may go for a big lineup. So Nyara, you're coming in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just thought what she brings, she has that X-factor. Her ability to make one-on-one plays, to rebound the ball, to play great defense. I mean, all of it. And then to finish plays. Finish plays."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So I prepared her. Really, really proud of her. I know she's had a lot of adversity over here career, but the biggest game of her career, and she really rose to the occasion. For a young player, that says a lot about her. I mean, the future is pretty bright."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Can I say something? Thank you.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what's incredible about Ny is if you look back at the semifinal series, she didn't really play. Then she stayed ready and knew that in the Finals, her time will come and she continued to stick with it. When we needed her most, because you were the X-factor tonight, Ny."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, we were tired. We were trying to do whatever we could. We needed, like a spark and she was that. She continued to trust the process and we are so proud of Ny. So proud."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"When I hugged Stewie, I was sobbing in her ear. I didn't say one word. I was just crying the whole time. I'm so happy to win and do it with her. We talked about it so much, about coming together and what we envisioned of what we wanted to do in New York, and what we could do, to be able to pull it off and accomplish a dream. It's so freaking hard to do. It just means a lot. It means a lot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I told her this before, but I've watched Stewie be great for so long, in high school and then in college and then in the WNBA. For a long time, she was that person that I was kind of like chasing in college I want my game to be at her level and play against her in the WNBA and to ultimately be teammates."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"It really just means a lot to be able to win with her and to watch the way that she approaches the game every day. The way that she leads our team, because she is our leader and we look to her in tough moments. So it just really means a lot to have everything come together and to be able to win together."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But then I think it was picture perfect to be able to embrace JJ. Really what I was saying was like, she led us. Her dominance in the paint, on the boards, help-side defense. Everything that we needed, she was there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"She had to wait awhile to get to this point, to get to the Finals to win a championship. But the wait was worth it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,Definitely was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"The wait was so, so, so worth it. We talked about it two years ago when it was free agency, and we wanted to come together. You look back and me, JJ, Sloot, we all came together to win a championship. Last year we lost in the Finals. But look at us, now we're here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,THE MODERATOR,"There's no practice tomorrow, so...."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,No practice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was like, let's go. You know, I've won one championship. I've been in many Finals and competed for so long. It's hard to win because this league is so good. You need a little bit of luck on your side, but you also need talent. You also need talent, the right talent to put together."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,I think Jonathan Kolb did a really great job of getting these players to come to New York and sell the vision that we had here. We wanted to win. New York has never won before.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,Now we are going to go in the history books as the first ever. That makes me very proud. Because it's hard. People think it's easy.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I was excited just to coach great talent. I didn't really know them that well. I knew Stewie probably a little bit more than JJ because I coached her wife, Marta, in Phoenix. Hopefully that helped a little bit to get her here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's a journey. So it's getting to know each other. I think it's been fun. Hey, let's not stop at one, though. Let's go for two."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I'm not really sure exactly when we flipped the switch. I just remember just like weathering the storm and us really talking about making sure we kept our emotions in check and that we just kept executing and that it was going to be a grind. I think obviously we came out with the win, but I don't really remember an exact moment where the switch was flipped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,How big was Leo's three in the corner? I'm going to tell you this as a fact Whoever scores first in overtime usually wins. I was confident after that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Am I really the only New Yorker on this team? That is incredible.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Honestly, winning in Seattle was amazing and nothing takes away from that. But to be able to bring the first ever to the Liberty and the first in 51 years -- like you guys know, my first WNBA game I ever went to was at MSG, was the Liberty. And to have that be full circle was amazing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Today throughout my whole day, everybody was texting me, like, ""How are you? Are you ready?"" All these things. ""Do your thing."""
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"And I was calm. I was ready because I knew that no matter what, the city was going to have our back. They showed up and they showed out, and they continued to be there for us when we needed. I'm so proud of this team but so happy to be able to bring the first championship here because the city deserves it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen this next week, but I'm sure s--- is going to be crazy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Parade in the Bahamas.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,Definitely. I think we need to have a parade in the Bahamas. Let's go!
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Really, really proud of JJ. I love coaching her. I just love her personality, how she brings it every single day. She was big for us. It wasn't a pretty game today. But we were trying to establish her early. At both ends, she worked her butt off. Usually I don't like to play her 42 minutes, but she just stayed competing because that's how important it was. She knew how she needed to help us. She's been big for us. She's been big for us all season long but particularly these playoffs. She's amazing. We love you, JJ. So proud of you, mate. You deserve this. Your first one, baby."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,We want to have an exhibition game in the Bahamas next year.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Parade.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Parade, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"Parade, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"For me, just trying to get the infrastructure of the Bahamas to be a little bit better for sports and especially girls sports in the Bahamas to be a little bit better. I think you need more investment in sports in the Bahamas, to give the kids more games and to allow them to be able to have more developmental camps and different things going on. Just to have more people invested in it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I want to make it my mission to help just grow the game in the Bahamas because we have so much natural talent. So many people that come out of the Bahamas go to the U.S. and go to school, end and up be being really successful. I would like the kids to be able to stay home in the Bahamas and stay with their families and then still be able to come to the U.S. to play professionally. That's the next step we have to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"I'm really proud of my journey. I was talking to Rebecca Lobo earlier after shootaround and just basically telling her, I was doing this thing where we are about to run out after our theme or whatever and they would have the theme music playing. I would look up and be just taking everything in and just really being appreciative of the moment and just having a moment of gratitude without -- with all the chaos that was going on in the Finals, just a moment to just exhale, to breathe and just look around at all the things that we've been able to do, and all the people that are in the gym watching women's sports and the city, like Stewie said, really supporting us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,JONQUEL JONES,"That really helped keep things in perspective. I went out there to play to win and not to lose. The experience that I had, even though it wasn't the best experience and we lost in the past, it allowed me to be a little bit more relaxed in the situation and just understand that these moments aren't guarantees. It's not a given. You have to kind of just take advantage of it but also live in the moment and really appreciate what it took to get here, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"That's a big lineup right there. But I mean, it means a lot, obviously. She did say something at halftime. But I feel like throughout the whole season, it's been unwavering support, whether from Sandy or my teammates and in general, everybody in this organization has always kind of believed in me, which means so much. They drafted me knowing I had to sit out a year. That just shows how much trust they have in me."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"I feel like this whole season, every time I'm on the floor, my teammates have my back and tell me just to keep going, work hard. It means the world to be able to have players like Stewie and JJ, who I've looked up to my whole career, be my teammates, and now win a championship with them. That's something that I will remember forever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"It's really hard to compare the Olympics to this moment. Especially with Team USA, because at the Olympics, we were going for eight straight gold medals. The pressure is insane, but also the pressure bringing a championship to a city that has never had one, especially in the WNBA, has been a lot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't know, this is something that I think I'll be remembering forever, and each Olympics I also remember forever. But the time together is so short. Like, it's three weeks."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But like, this is my team. This is my squad. We continue to go to battles together. With the Olympics, you come together for a few days. You have practice and then you go and you play exhibition games against Germany in London, and it's hard to build that chemistry and stuff. But you just know you're Team USA and here now, we're New York Liberty."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't think I answered your question, but each one is really special, and they are not comparable."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, this one? This is more personal. This is more personal because I'm from New York. I'm from upstate. I came here for a reason, and that's to win a championship."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Thank you for that shaking Breanna's hand.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Yeah, I mean, it's really just the -- thinking in German, sorry."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,You speak German? Go for it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Really it's just the mental preparation of staying ready and being locked in, knowing that whenever you have -- like whatever minutes you get, that's what you get and you need to be ready to go on the floor. Because our team has such a high standard, and really, to be able to live up to that, you have to be mentally ready. Otherwise, you'll just kind of hurt the team in the long run."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"But with great teammates like that, it's kind of easy to just get on the floor and leave it all out there. Because my role is pretty simple Run the floor, get rebounds and maybe shoot some buckets. But they make it really easy. They make it really easy for me. It's just like I always said, there's so much talent on the floor, and just being able to bring something to that is just something everybody dreams of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Pepper, we got you. We got you. But it's not tomorrow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just went in and told them what I saw and what we needed to do, the adjustments. Obviously I didn't think we were playing with the right amount of urgency. Things were a little too easy for them, and so I just encouraged them. Hey, let's go, 20 more minutes. Then I talked about the big lineup. Be ready for the big lineup. I just thought, I was thinking that all day today, and if things are going hard, we're fatigued. It's been a grueling schedule, five games, and that's a tough team, just the way that they make us work really hard."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,So I kind of prepared Nyara in that regard and I'm very thankful that it worked well for us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,I'll talk for the players.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,"Yes, please."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what we said was Minnesota, they had 34 points at halftime. Our offense wasn't coming easy, but eventually it was going to come through. Continue to shoot your shots with confidence. But if it's going to be an ugly game, we will win ugly. We've talked about first five minutes, first five minutes, whatever. No. Third quarter. Third quarter is going to be our quarter, especially with the city behind us and the fans behind us. We came out and continued to execute. I think throughout the entire game, we talked about coming together. Huddling, talking about schemes, making sure everybody is calm and confident. And we did that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yes, we did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,NYARA SABALLY,Seven games next year.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"Seven, nice. Hopefully we have more time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,Basically we knew we had more in the tank to give and 20 more minutes for the end of the season.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"I felt like, because I was just thinking about today, and it's like whether we win or lose, we want to put it all on the line. Because last year when we lost, there was more in the tank. And this year, that wasn't happening."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure. All season long, Lan has been in those positions for us. Just appreciate her ability to turn around and buck up and do what her team needed her to do. She's important. Important for her to be on the floor for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I thought it was obvious what we were trying to do. We went four flat and said, Court, make a play. The last thing we said was, we've got to get the last shot. Didn't want to shoot too early. Make sure we get the last shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"We said, BC Bridget Carleton, if you have a chance, follow it up and see if you can tip one in and get fouled laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I think the players, the players deserve all the credit for the show that we are being treated to. I thought both teams played well. It was a good game. Obviously both teams, things you can point to -- you wish you made a layup or you wish you didn't do this or that. That's the way a game always is."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"But no, I'm looking forward to seeing what the ratings are for this one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"The same defense as always. Try to make it as hard as possible for them to get the shots they want. They are good players. They are going to get shots off. But they can't get easy ones. So that's my goal, to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it's an epitome of the year she's had and how important she's been to the team. Shot making, big three. She's a hustle-play player, so that was on display. Go give yourself a chance to maybe either put it in or get fouled."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,That's just what she does every day we are around her. She's the same. You can always count on her to be there for you. We're obviously super proud of Bridget.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Same. I completely agree. I feel like Bridget is just so reliable every time. Like Coach said, we can bank on her to make those hustle plays and to be cool and collected at the end to make those free throws. That's the hardest shot, honestly, in basketball, is to make free throws at the end of the game. To make those at the down at the big moment is who BC is."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,They were saying Naz Reid free tattoos. I think BC free tattoos is next.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I think you hit the nail on the head. It's unfortunate those teams were a joy to watch. But it's a sign of the times where we are now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't know about these guys, but I know when I'm out and I'm in different places and I'm going to one, everyone is talking about it. Everyone is talking to me about it, talking about, I go to this bar, and this is a bar that maybe wouldn't have a women's game on five years ago. All the TVs have the game on and the volume on, and the place is going crazy. I heard that so many times in different establishments."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,And obviously I appreciate the opportunity that A Bar of Their Own has given women in making that front and center. I'm happy to support a woman-owned business like that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that what this team has done, obviously the Wolves energized the city in their playoff run, and I'm thrilled to see the same energy came for this team because they deserve it. Obviously the crowd was there tonight, but even more than that, everywhere you go around the city, people are talking about the Lynx."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"It's really tough. I think we are both great players. It was Game 4 and we played each other, what, four times in the regular season. It's going to get harder and harder each time to get the shots that you normally get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Everyone is out there to do the same thing make shots hard. That's my goal every time. She's a great player, one of the best players in the world. But you have to make it as hard as you can for her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to answer the second part, the Game 5. I don't really think about the other ones. I do feel very blessed in my career to have a chance to have been a part of so many. Haven't won them all. You know, when I was in Detroit, we suffered a heartbreak at home. So it runs the gamut. I think that what I'm just thrilled about is that this group gets to experience the Game 5."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It's beyond words how we feel about this team, and we just so wanted them to be in the Finals, No. 1 and two, put themselves in a position to win a championship, and we've done just that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't get a response from the league. I have a text to prove it. I think that -- I think Phee has some things to prove that the fouls weren't called.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"That's unfortunate. You know, I guess I don't really have much more than that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Wish I knew. I'd either not eat or not sleep or I'd sleep really good if I knew the difference. It's two great teams. Who knows? Who knows.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I wanted to come out and enjoy the moment and be as aggressive as possible. When you're playing for your season, after the last game you sit with everything, and you erase it and you want to leave all those internal feelings and put it out there and embrace the crowd."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I just wanted to be out there with my teammates and give it everything we had. Shots go in, they don't go in, whatever. There are always things you can fix. But I was just excited to be out there and compete again after the last game. Shots were falling. That's always a good thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,We were celebrating together and she was saying how proud she is of us and the team. I was telling her that she has to get her butt to New York.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Anybody that has been following along knows this team, from the beginning of the season all the way through to Game 4, has this unique ability to believe in themselves and believe in each other. What we said before the game, can we do it in the toughest of times, right. Because this will be the most that we are tested. We talked about it in shootaround. This will be the most this group has been tested in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I was sure how we would connect and compete. Not sure whether you're going to win the game or not. But I was sure that we were going to be the Minnesota Lynx and how we have done things all season long. You know, the ups and downs and all of that, this group is just equipped to handle it. It's special."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"It was expected. Going into the game, we talked about it in the pregame that we were going into the game as if that didn't happen. Whatever was going to show itself was going to show itself and we were going to react. But we didn't have any minute restrictions and anything else we were doing to modify. Just competed."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"We did try to get some players off the floor a little bit more. This one Collier -- we thought about it. But I think overall I was concerned about leaving Lan too long on the bench, sitting too long. But other than that, we weren't concerned."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, Ceci is tough. You know, goes through a stretch of games where maybe she's not contributing like she wants to contribute, and then all of a sudden we had a Ceci sighting at shootaround the other day and these last two games really helping us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy for her. We've always stayed in touch through the years. We've always tried to get her back here. Timing was good for this one, and she's been a great fit for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Sounds like he's rooting for them. He didn't text that to me.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,I love it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,Huskies drama.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,Looks like I'm going to have to text him about some things now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Bench was really important. We knew they were going to be. They were ready. They were ready. There was a lot of conversations, the teammates, getting them going and getting them ready to be able to make contributions when they got in the game. Give Dorka credit as she remained patient, and when she got the opportunity, I thought her minutes were good. We'll look at the video. But it was nice to be able to have players able to sub in and stay out there for extended time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,Is that why we missed layups so we can get down to the nitty-gritty? Is that what she's saying? Laughter.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. Laughter. My heart is still racing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think we gain energy and confidence from one another. I feel like internally we are strong, strong-minded mentally and physically. We have a lot of belief within our group. We problem solve with each other. It's just a belief, like, internally. I don't know how else to explain it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,NAPHESSA COLLIER,"I think we're excited. I don't even know if I'm thinking about that. I'm thinking that it's a Game 5 of the Finals, that we need to go out and execute. That's really all I'm thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, last 40 minutes of the season. It could be anywhere, really. It doesn't matter. We are going to be out there together going to war, and I'm pumped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"Elite players play no matter the environment, home, road. Elite players play and they love the environment and they are not affected by the environment. That's why you see the series has been what it has, winning on each other's court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to say probably information gathered in the three games. Everything is getting harder. So the edge that maybe other games that provided each team, there's no secrets at this point."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I actually was trying to call a timeout, but they didn't hear me. So that's on me. But yeah, you know, it wasn't our best possession. It was loud in here. I don't know, maybe I just have to sprint out in the middle of the court next time. So I've got to be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think that I was going a little bit too fast. I just needed to slow down. They are sending multiple people when I'm slipping on a screen, stuff like that. A little bit better awareness on my part. But quick turnaround and be ready for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"With the two seconds? Yeah, it was like a little screen to get JJ to the block. If not, Sabrina had to come out. So with two seconds, we tried to establish the big girl down low. They defended it well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, obviously they are great players. I think Stewie said it, we took some shots, we probably could have moved it a little bit more."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, I will say this, and I look at the thing here and I know Cheryl talked about it last time, but we got no calls today. So do I need to talk up in a press conference? Because they were getting ticky-tacks. And we went down there and got hit and get nothing. It was like 12-6 at halftime and they tried to even it up near the end. It was 14-9."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"No. All we want is fair, okay. So if we are getting hit, that's a foul. You know, I'm one of the nicest bloody coaches in this league, but this pisses me off. Just be fair. You know, if they are getting hit, it's a bloody foul."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that expletive timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,JONQUEL JONES,It's a close-out game. Their backs are against the wall and we are trying to win. It was going to be that type of game tonight where we are both trying to claw and both teams are trying to figure out whatever to do to get over the hump.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, that's what we said we worked for all season long. Minnesota did what they needed to do here to tie it up, and now we go back home. We love playing in front of our home crowd."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So it will definitely be another sellout, and it will definitely be loud. And we have to bring our ""A"" game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I have a lot of respect for Minnesota, don't get me wrong. This is a really tough team, really tough team. They play well. They compete. So we've got one more game, and we're going to win on our home court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"Short-term memory. Just the fact that all that happened tonight is the series is even, and there's a Game 5, winner-take-all. We are going back to New York, and we're going to get it done. You know, getting it done there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, of course. We wanted to get it done tonight. But like Sandy said, our fans are like no other, and to be able to go into our environment on Sunday, know they have our backs. So whenever there are tough situations, whenever we're fighting through all of this adversity, we know we have the crowd behind us. That's just going to continue to motivate us. Yeah, can't wait for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that, you know, for our team, we bounce back after a loss really, really well, and making sure that everybody is on the same page going forward."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,BREANNA STEWART,"In the playoffs, in a series, there's going to be momentum shifts. There were momentum shifts in the game tonight. But mentally, understanding what's our ultimate goal, how are things going right here. Like Sandy said in the locker room, we haven't won anything yet we haven't lost anything yet. And we have the opportunity to do that Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, I thought as you said, we had the appropriate effort and focus on what we were doing. As the game wore on, the offense got harder and harder for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I just think that one of the things, and you know, like I was saying after Game 1, you feel like the ball isn't moving enough, and I think we got easy stuff when we were able to do that. We were taking hard shots. We had good shots. Didn't make shots, right, and that's what it comes down to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Stewie was making shots. JJ's big three when we were up four, that was a big three. Then obviously Ionescu's shot at the end. It's a battle. We talked about that, players making plays. Unfortunately, we didn't make enough of them to put the ball in the hole."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I mean, I'll let these guys talk about that. Go ahead, you guys. Jump in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I feel like they were making plays at the end of shot clocks and like Coach said, we were getting really good looks. We just weren't executing on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's just hard when you get that and then obviously they are a great offensive team and like Coach said in the locker room, it just puts a lot of pressure on our defense. I think we just need to make more shots, honestly."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't have an update, game finished what, 15 minutes ago? I haven't talked to the trainer."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,KAYLA McBRIDE,Great player made a good shot. I guarded her for 40 minutes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, obviously give credit to Lan. She did what should he could do. We were plus 20 when she was on the floor. So it obviously hurt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our starting five is a really good starting five, and you know, not having Lan, foul trouble, and then just not feeling like she could go put us in a bit of a bind."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, tried different things. You know, just a little bit of a small lineup. See if we could spread the floor and get some easier shots but that didn't produce itself either. We need our starters, just like they need their starters."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't necessarily know that it was -- obviously got fouled. She was, you know, asserting herself in that way. The game is called differently for Phee than it is for Stewie for sure. You look at the same level of activity, and around-the-rim contact. For whatever reason, we have a hard time getting to the foul line in this series."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I think they were getting some switches that they were picking on. You know, as Lan was switching on her. She made some great plays. She attacked, she made threes, she got it going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Our defense gave us a chance to win the game. Our defense gave us a chance to win the game, period, and our offense is going to help our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"If you told me that we would have got the amount of stops that we did and we were playing off that, and we wouldn't have scored 80, that would be surprising to me. This team scored 80, its 77-all with the remaining seconds left."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"I'll have to look at the film. I know when I was watching it live, I liked some of the shots that we were getting. I've seen our players make those shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"You know, it's not to sit here and say, you know, that New York doesn't get credit for, you know, their defense. Just they are a good defensive team. I'll have to watch it but I felt like we got some good opportunities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, yeah. We just need to score the ball a couple times. Just a couple times. We were up four. Like I said, that JJ three sort of changed things for them, right. If we get that stop and we just score one or two more times, that's our game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's a hard-fought game, right. Really great game. That's one that, you know, we convert just a couple and it's our game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"So, our defense, and like the things that you mentioned, we did those things. We played well enough at that end. Obviously, it seems crazy to say when Stewie has 30 but you know, she had 38, 39 on us and they only scored 78, 79 points. We were right there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,For sure. For sure. That's what we just talked about. This is Phee's first Finals. So she's feeling these things for the first time. K-Mac has been there.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"The hardest thing to do, I imagine you guys feel it when you are watching, there's so many ups and downs and swings and all around, and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to sort of weather those swings, and here we are. We're disappointed. We're home. We played well and just couldn't come up with the win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"It's important that you don't get too high when you win and too low when you lose, and it's really hard. It's really, really hard but we've got to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home with our tremendous fans. And you know, we'll see what we can do on Friday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it feels great. I mean, that's something that -- obviously it's the ultimate goal is to be here and to get a win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Doesn't feel great right now, obviously, with a loss. But I am excited to look at film and see what we can do better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it feels amazing. The crowd was awesome. To play at home in the Finals is such a rush. So definitely looking forward to the next game.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,CHERYL REEVE,"Her contributions today, she was back to being BC for us. So we were glad to see that, and we'll continue that into game four."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,That was just a great All WNBA Second-Team performance laughter. That's it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I mean, you know, in the time-out, Sandy kind of was just like, you're going to shoot this shot. You know, I feel like I was able to get a little separation in range and get a really good shot to go. Obviously wanting to let the shot clock wind down. And got the space that I needed to get my feet under me and felt comfortable taking that shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn't. I've practiced that shot a thousand times in my head, on the court, and I feel like that's just something that as athletes, you put yourself in that position to want to be able to make a shot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"And obviously like we don't win this game without Stewie. What she was able to do, just continued to chip away. Obviously she'll speak, but I mean, yeah, there's nothing I could say. Like that shot's nice but that doesn't go against what she's been able to do for us tonight and how she was able to just will us back into that game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we were all kind of just waiting for our moment. You know, waiting for the script to flip a little bit. You know, they talked about it. They talked about first five minutes, going to come out punching. They punched us in the face in the first quarter and we continued to wear them down."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We knew that our pace was something that made them tired and for me, it was just kind of like I was motivated. I was mad. And I liked my matchups that I had, and really kind of attacking them to make sure that we could get this back into where we needed to be for it to be a ballgame."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Just continuing to kind of be in help side and know that we did some different schemes. We sometimes were sending two to the ball and then leaving somebody open and making sure that, you know, between JJ and I, like we are going to protect the rim at all costs and make sure that nothing is easy, because this is the Finals and everything is going to be tough and we're going to make everybody work for it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,That's why I can't be miked up.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I'm not sure exactly what the situation was. Might have been when it was 71-69, because I feel like we were at that score for a long time. But just I could feel it. You know, you could feel the momentum was shifting to our side."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"They were up and their shots weren't falling. We were getting good looks, and it's like, if we are going to be this close, we are not leaving here without this win. It's tough to play in this arena, but the way that we continued to stay together is something that I'm not shocked at but I am really proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,I was mad we were losing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We know we're one game away from winning the championship, and I think that they are going to give us their best shot. They are going to give everything they have got, and you know what, so are we. The turnaround is quick but we are going to continue to be ready. There's a lot of things that we didn't do right tonight and have a kind of quick memory. I think that we're happy we got this win but we're -- the job's not done."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I just went up and gave him a big shot. Him and Jodie Berry, our assistant coach came down and he kind of told me the same thing, like there was never a doubt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Obviously him, Sandy, all the coaches that I've had, just their continued belief and pouring into me means the world to me whether I make or miss that shot. Like the fact that they kind of trusted me to go out there and make big shots, that's why I love playing for this team and continue to pour my all."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's pretty special. It was never in doubt. Obviously Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there, but I thought the right time, this is Sabrina. She just made a big shot. She's a great shooter and she just needed a little bit of separation."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, definitely the biggest shot of my career and hopefully not the last."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,It did. Pretty nice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Not for us. I think that, you know, this feels like we're playing on their home court, and I feel like each game is so different. You know, you go from 1 to 2 to 3. But the way that we continue to fight and be resilient. I don't want to speak for you guys. Doesn't feel like Game 1 to me. Feels like Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"At this point, I don't know."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I think -- well, I think the way that we fought back in the second, knowing that our offense didn't really click yet but we were able to limit them defensively. But then in the third, when we had a strong push, a strong punch. You guys know the first two games, our third quarters have been a struggle to score offensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"We were getting downhill. We were attacking and we were being confident. If a mistake happened, like a turnover or a missed shot or like something just doesn't go our way, we didn't panic. We continued to play and continued to fight through it because we know how big this moment is. We have the experience of the good, bad, ugly, and different."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, we didn't come out how we wanted to start the game. We knew they'd threw the first punch. I thought we weren't playing how we wanted to play physically, mentally with the pace and everything. But credit to them. They were taking us out of stuff that we wanted to do and they were making big shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I trust this team. I feel like we've grown so much. We've handled adversity even from Game 1, you know what I mean? It's like, okay, this is a totally different game here and we just had to chip away."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I did. I felt confident. Even with that last shot I felt confident, okay, because we worked hard and we found a way to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think that what the big three means is between Sab, JJ and myself, we know when it's our time to step up and to make an impact. And over the course of the game, it's like sometimes things are hard. Sometimes things are frustrating. I pick up two fouls in the first quarter. But knowing that our team trusts and believes in us to be in this position to take these shots, to help get the game in the right place, but at the same time we wouldn't be here without our teammates, and having that trust and belief just gives us confidence."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,BREANNA STEWART,"I don't know. Like, you guys talk about the run, Sab's shot. There was so many players that came in that were like such an important piece of what we were able to do tonight just because they made Minny tired and that's what makes this team really special. It's a collective win even though some of us are shining a little bit brighter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I think it's important to just read the game, and being able to get downhill and find JJ on a really important basket that, helped us late in the game. Because you're just not really one-dimensional. The defense doesn't know what you're going to do Are you going to shoot it are you going to pass it? Are you going to be a screener, a decoy? There's just so many opportunities that when you have the gravity we have to be able to make it tough on the defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"JJ was huge for us. The way that she protected the rim, hit a huge three, hit that layup, like just continue to go chip away, and it was a total team effort. Like Stewie said, we're not here without every single person on this team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,Just in the locker room waiting on Stewie. I would say I really didn't realize how far out I was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, like I kind of, you know, wasn't sure if I was dribbling with my right or left hand and then I was like, oh, yeah, I did hit that step-back."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"But I just didn't really realize how far I was, but like I said, it's a shot that I take often and I take in practice and that I take before the game. It's not like a Hail Mary, hope this goes in. It's like, once I got it off, I was like, yeah, this is in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I was really, really happy with Nyara. It was the plan to give her a few more extra minutes tonight. Stewie came in a little sooner because Stewie got two fouls early."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She played so hard. She was winded by the end of those seven minutes. We played her seven minutes in a row but she was so effective. Just the ability, they were being so aggressive, and what Nyara brings is she's always on her front foot getting downhill. She's always going to run the floor, just a hundred miles an hour, which is what we needed."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So it's been great to see her growth, and yeah, it was never in doubt there. But obviously I went to Slooty early, too, and I thought that changed the pace of the game. We struggled a little bit. Not often do I sit both of these at the same time, very rarely. But I felt like we needed to at that moment, and I think they gave us really good energy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We got it back to ten after that first quarter, and I think that was the thing. We've got to keep grinding, keep grinding, and as the game went on, we got back to playing Liberty Basketball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Our offense was bad at a time when we really needed it. Our pace was slow. Taking too long to get into things, and you know, I don't think we were terribly hard to play against from that standpoint. And that was obviously a difficult time to be doing that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm disappointed that we let it get to 17. I'm more disappointed in that. I'm more than disappointed, I'm pissed that that happened again."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Sure, did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It's hard. You have to adjust to the refs. Definitely it's not an excuse. We played really bad. I'm definitely not using that as an excuse.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it's hard to adjust because you are playing one way and you are getting used to the refs and then they change it up. But that's not why we lost. It wasn't them. It was us. Can't blame that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,It's been talked about a lot. This is a group that problem solves well together. They never think they are out of it. Their belief in themselves and their belief in each other is top-notch. And we know it's a long game. They are very experienced.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"We just knew what we had to clean up, get some things cleaned up and we did that then. Put ourselves in position, right where we wanted to be and just couldn't get over the hump."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"I don't think it affected the game. I don't know if it affected her play. Phee can answer that. It was a chance to get her three minutes of rest and at the end of the quarter, that was fine, and then she went back in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,So it didn't affect us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Huge difference. So both games they have gotten help from part of their -- they have a big five, right, their starters are all very capable, just like our starters are all very capable and you need players beyond your stars, and for two games, they have done that. We're having trouble getting that consistently and we've got to have that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I mean, yeah, obviously you want to steal one on the road. We're really disappointed I think in how we played today but excited to go home and play in front of our crowd, and we have to respond. We have to come out playing better than we did in these two games."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It's hard. Like we are both competing for a championship. You have to play with a level of desperation from the very beginning, and so that's what we're going to need to do to come out in Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I honestly don't feel like I changed my mindset. I feel like I stayed aggressive on defense. I was frustrated that I had those four fouls but I don't think it affected me in the way that I was playing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"No, I happen to agree with you. I had a chance to talk to Joe Ingles, I don't know if I told Lan this when we were in Minnesota, and he asked me how I liked my Australian. And we talked about all the ways that we love the way that Lan plays and her level of compete, and that's what Joe said. He's like, one thing you're darned sure an Australian is going to do is compete their tails off."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"And Lan is the very definition of that. Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how difficult it is. Lan is always there for us in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"We were trying to get another ball handler out there, somebody they had to pay attention to, try to get downhill a little bit, try to create some easier opportunities playing with flow. Setups weren't necessarily producing anything for us, so we just thought, spread the floor and play with two ball handlers."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Well, I mean, what did she have at half, 12? Ten of them were in fast break. Ten of them were fast break. So what changed is she wasn't able to get it in the fast break and we had her in the halfcourt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,I think Stewie is the same. I don't think making her missing a shot or free throw. We do this long enough that those things happen. She's resilient. She played exactly like we thought she would. I thought she played great in Game 1.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"And so you know, I think her impact defensively was something that we felt. You know, what did she have, seven steals? And so you know, she's been doing that in these playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"More than that, in my mind -- you have to ask Stewie, but I don't think that's what was on her mind. I think what was on their collective minds is it's a must-win game for them and they came out and played like it was, and they took the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, but I think the opponent has a fair amount to do with it. We have to come up with better opportunities and better things that we can do offensively so that we can get back to a little bit more of a balanced scoring."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,So I think that's most important to say is New York has had a lot to do with this.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"You've got players that are playing a lot of minutes, a lot of heavy minutes, and any time you can get your bench to come in and be productive and you can keep them out there longer, that's an advantage."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"But I don't think either bench has been necessarily a separator. We talked about Hiedeman in the last game. She scored it. I think she had ten, right. So that was impactful."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,CHERYL REEVE,"But you know, both teams are looking for anywhere else you can go so that you don't have all this pressure on your top players."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"What we continued to keep saying to one another was like stay together, keep playing. Every rebound matters. And even if our offense gets a little bit stagnant and funky, we are not going to let that dictate what we do defensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, massive. They have been going under on screens so we encouraged her to shoot the three. She's a great three-point shooter. She was stroking it yesterday in practice before the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, she was digging deep and that's what we needed. We knew we needed to bounce back and it was a big bounce-back game. They contained Leonie a little bit after what she did in Game 1 but B helped us get this margin to win the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. Just like not letting history repeat itself and knowing that Game 1 happened but now, you know, how can we control Game 2 and I think that honestly the thought process was, we were trying to be up a little bit more. Like not letting them get to the three-point line to set up their offense. And then in to out, whether I'm helping, I know that Sab or whoever else is helping on my backside, and making them have to move just a little bit quicker than they want to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"No. Honestly -- sorry, I'll just rant laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I kind of texted him and I was like, you know what it's about time that you come to my game. I've been here for two years and he hasn't come down. What are you doing? Yeah, CD Dailey came and she got that same message, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a long drive.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,Two hours.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B brings is this grit, this toughness, knowing that -- and all of us know, she's giving us whatever she's got, and the way that she continued to be aggressive, they were going under on her and she knocked that thing down with confidence, got into the paint, drive and kicks."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,But that's what we're used to. We know she can do this and happy to see her get into a good rhythm with everything that's been up and down this season and know that she's a big factor in everything we do.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think that the first thing was higher pick-up points, knowing that if Leo was going to be up, really trying to limit Courtney Williams, then I need to be there, too. So when Phee is dribbling up it's without any pressure."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"That's really what my goal was, was just take what the defense gives me and not forcing anything but understanding I'm going to be able to drive and kick. And players hit, multiple players hit really big shots. But obviously I think coming out like that was great for us to get going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"And then in the second half, they made some adjustments and I think it was understanding being able to drive passing lanes and find the open man, if they are going to bring a few on the ball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,So I just did that. I don't always need to be looking to score every single time I have the ball. Just continue to make the right read and understanding what it is that provides our best offense as a team.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think everyone has seen her. She's been struggling but she's been feeling good these last few days, can tell you that much. She has been."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We just knew it was a bit of time. We've given her so much rest here and she was ready to go. She puts the work in. Like I said, she's tough. We talked about the grittiness that she gives us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But it's great that you put the ball in her hand and be more of a playmaker, because it takes a little bit more pressure off these two in particular. I thought that was very effective for us. But her defense, she was everywhere. She was guarding everyone. I'm really happy for her. We just have to freshen up and get ready for the next game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B and I were continuing to say in the huddles was defensively, you know, the schemes because they went small. So it means our matchups are a little bit different. And making sure that we have each other's help. If we are weak side, who is high, who is low. Just those type of things, and knowing that like scores and stops, we're playing the long game in the last two minutes, and making sure that we are all are on the same page."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I mean, I think we missed her grittiness and just she's the ultimate competitor. She takes pride -- she used to always guard the best player and obviously now we have Leo, too, that makes us really a versatile defensive team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But you also miss her play-making. That's something we talked about this year. We wanted to make sure she could play-make more and it was hard for to play-make when she was hobbling around with the knee. We need her to get confidence first, and then to go out and play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She's just impactful because she plays at both ends of the floor, and plays hard, and she's a winner. So happy that she got the success tonight and keep building on it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Well, I'm not from here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Geno. Vivian, has been here for B. It's great."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a full house tonight. It was really loud.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,Largest crowd ever.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Loudest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,BREANNA STEWART Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,She's not from here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,I'm not from here. Loudest? Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'm not from here. It's great. We talked about the winner is women's basketball, WNBA. So many fans coming out to watch these amazing players play, but yeah, they are all welcome. All coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,My coach is coming to Minnesota.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,Okay. Kelly is coming.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,SABRINA IONESCU Go Ducks.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think the moment the game ended Thursday night, I was looking forward to Sunday, just to be able to kind of change things, change the narrative a little bit, and know that I'm going to come out and be the same that I was and be obviously better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But throughout this entire process, my team has my back every step of the way and was just excited to have another opportunity to go to battle with them. Because we have a lot of fun in everything that we do, and you know, it's not always like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"It was the difference in this last game. I think that especially after watching the film of Game 1, we slowed down to a pace that is a little bit awkward for us. We want to play fast and we want to move the ball and we want to get downhill and we want to score, obviously."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"So making sure that no matter what, we continue to play fast, we get good shots and we get that defense moving."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Understanding how teams are playing me and being able to make that adjustment in real time. Possession by possession, quarter by quarter, teams have kind of changed the way they have guarded, whether they are switching, hedging, trapping. And I think being able to just be poised and understanding what it is that I need to do in order to create an advantage for the team that we have out there on the floor is what I've always wanted to do, and I feel like I've been able to do that in a really good spot."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,Obviously my teammates set really good screens and are able to get me open in order for me open to create for them.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"I'd say it worked pretty well for us, understanding that we use our big lineup and knowing that, you know, we can get the ball inside. We can switch. We're able to apply pressure defensively with our length and being able to get steals and just disrupt their flow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"But obviously it's a series and it's a chess match and they are going to throw different adjustments, and I think our ability to stay poised and being able to kind of see what it is that they are doing in real time is going to be crucial."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,Now we have seen their small ball lineup and we're going to go back and find ways that we can execute while they have that group on the floor.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we weren't happy the way we played we and we talked about our principles of play. We have it on our wall, there's a way that we want to play when we are at out best, when we are at pace and moving it, setting good screens and getting second and third side when we need it, but with a good inside-outside attack. We came out, and I think that was very effective for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,We always want to try to get the ball to JJ. They bring a lot of congestion and we probably would have liked to put it in more cleaner in some areas but she demands so much attention down there. I thought the are best thing was obviously just getting on the boards. I think she was fantastic for us.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And that's what we need. You know, some games you are going to get more touches than other games and shoot but it's more about playing in the right way and sharing the ball and good to great. I think shot selection wasn't great last game. So it's about making those adjustments and continue to play the way that we want to play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was thinking no, no, she's up -- no, no, she's going to shoot it. But a three-point shot is a layup for her. We encourage her to shoot all those threes. I know she missed one just before it. But I love the confidence that she brings."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We talk about her being a rookie. She's not really a rookie. She has this experience in really big moments and the mindset to handle this atmosphere extremely well, and to make a play like that, I mean, I love it. She's an amazing player and an amazing human being."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, you know, I think kind of piggybacking off of the question that I answered from Pepper, it's understanding when I'm getting into the paint, the defense has to make a decision. They are either going to come and take me or they are going to play, you know two on one on the back side, and there's Leo and B in the corner, and as a defender, you just have to take your pick between the two."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"I was able to just drive in, look her off, and obviously B -- a corner three for B is a layup as well. She shoots that at a really high clip and really well. So I kind of baited Alanna Smith into thinking I was going to pass it high. And B hit a huge shot for us that changed the momentum of the game and continued to extended the lead. I think they called a time-out a little bit after that. It was huge for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"We believe in her. She knows that. This was a huge game. She played a huge role in the game ending up the way that it did and she's going to continue to do it for these next two games, we know that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I think we've been in these moments before on opposing court when it gets really, really loud, and it's more about making sure we stay true to who we are. We kind of know how we want to play. We know that they are going to make runs. We know the crowd is going to get into it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But we've just got to continue to play -- stay true to who the New York Liberty are, and if we can do that, we can overcome any obstacle."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We have had great starts in both games, but I thought our -- how much they were talking in the huddle, you know, it wasn't just me talking all the time. They're going ""We have got to rebound. The possession game."""
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just thought, when we play like that, with the pace that we went out and just the effort and the energy we put into the defensive side with the scramble and the help, good things happen. It was just more about staying persistent."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We kept Minnesota to 27 points in that second half, that's pretty good. And some of our scramble defense, we were down 1-0. So you know, we should be playing like that. And now we can tidy up some things and they can tidy up some things as well, too. We'll look forward to playing another tough game on Wednesday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I mean, I think we embrace it. We like it when it's loud. We like it when it's difficult. You know, as we did tonight when it's so loud that you can't hear, you know, just expecting that when we go to Minnesota, hopefully it's going to be an incredible atmosphere for both of those games."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But just continuing to stick together, and I think also, the biggest thing behind it is like not getting too high or too low, you know. Things are going to seem bigger than what they are because they are playing at home, and I'm sure Minnesota said the same thing when they are playing here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But yeah, we like to go on the road."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, obviously I stayed up watching the game, not too late laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"But it was a nail-biter. But I mean, after they won the way that they did, today I was like, yeah, I'm going to wear my Oregon shoes because I wanted to embody that tough, gritty win that they pulled off, which is probably one of the biggest wins that our program has had there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"A lot of things didn't go right for them and they just continued to fight and stay together and grind out a really big win. I was like, all right, I want to bring that energy with me today on the court and kind of do the same thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,So I think I'm going to wear the same shoes again on Wednesday.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,Lucky shoes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,We are the first team in WNBA playoff history to be down 15 and come back and win the game. So that ranks really high.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it defines our team in terms of being able to get through difficult times. That's what we say, we've been talking about, all these interviews we've been given, that's what we are talking about You have to be mentally tough and resilient. You have to look inward and not blame other people, and give each other confidence."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"And we were that team. You know, thrilled that we could hang in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I mean, he believes in us like we believe in ourselves. I think we have such a tight-knit circle with our families involved as well, and we all know what we can do in that. We never give up."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,He embodies all of our families. They all believe that we can come back and we can win and we can stay composed and hopefully win. The basketball gods were on our side tonight.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"Honestly, whatever the folks want to call me, I'm with whatever. As long as they're showing love. If you show me love, you can call me whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"That's just a testament to how we believe in each other. We have so many great three-point shooters, and the fact that these girls are out here trying to get me the ball, I mean, I could cry. This is amazing. I love it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I say that all the time, and I don't say that for fun. These people I'm around, we believe in each other so much. It's crazy, man. I'm happy to be here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"From a basketball standpoint, Courtney recognized that she had to get more aggressive. Not pick up her dribble. Her team needed her to be aggressive to go score the basketball. We needed some help. Phee got going as well. But Courtney has been around for a while. She has been in Finals games, and she knows her team needed her to get aggressive."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I think just taking it one possession at a time. We've been in situations where we've been down before, and that's when we really lean on our defense. That's something we were talking about, getting three stops in a row, chipping at it a little bit at a time. Not thinking about the point difference, but thinking about the possession that we need to get a stop and a score. That's just what we were talking about at halftime."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Just every game, I try to go out and impact defensively. Especially when they are going on a run like that, they have amazing offensive players, and so trying to be as disruptive as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It just goes in preparation. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us and playing tendencies and just playing defense.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Again, they are great offensive players. They are going to make plays. I just have to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I don't know where it ranks. It's 1 right now because we are here. I like to be where my feet are planted. So it's 1 right now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy she made a clutch free throw, if you go and look --"
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,Laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"That helped her a little bit, clutch free throws, that was good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I messed that up laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't feel that way. Those are your words.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"We know it's a long series. Nothing is won in the first quarter. It was not the first quarter that we were hoping for. What our narrative was in the timeouts was just we had to find our footing. Find our footing defensively, and we did the second quarter. We held them to 12 after giving up 32. We went into halftime in good shape."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"No question about it, the second-chance points are really, really disappointing. That could have really cost us, and we were very, very fortunate that we overcame that. But defensively, we knew what we had to get done. Once our offense improved a little bit and we stopped turning the ball over."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,But they played terrific. I thought New York played terrific. Their pace was terrific. They run so many great things. They are unique in what they do. They found JJ repeatedly. She had a tremendous game. We had to overcome a lot.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"And then you look up at the end, and you know, we held them below 40 percent, which is monumental. A lot of that was obviously late. We got big stops when we needed them. Repeatedly, whether ball is going out of bounds or 5050 balls, referees, whatever happens, jump balls, fouls, all that stuff, we just had to be gritty at the end. We had to get stops to win and that's what I'm proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"Well said. Alanna is one of our highest WARP players, if you're into analytics. She's one of our highest. You know, like you said, she's not going to wow you. She's not going to fly around, scoring the ball, making post moves. It's not her. But what she does for our team, both offensively and defensively, it's not underappreciated, I can tell you that. It's a little bit understated. People have to really watch to recognize what she does for us. Fighting through. Every night, she's playing against the opposing team's big, and she's not big. And so if you look at the success that she has in doing that, it's the reason why we're sitting here today in the Finals. She's Second Team All-Defense, along with Collier as Defensive Player of the Year. Those two are the heart and soul of our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"No, it is the margin. It is the margin. But I hear what you're saying, in that when it mattered, we got some hustle plays. And we always say, you never know which one is going to be the difference between winning and losing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"That last possession, I think we learned from an earlier playoff game when we were down how we wanted to play that last possession. And so being aggressive and getting the three ball and do what we had to do, if one didn't go in, you know, get as many chances as we could get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"If the bigs weren't rebounding, might as well go small. Couldn't get any worse, right? What we wanted was a couple ball handlers, get downhill, try to get some easier stuff and pace, etc. That was actually, I don't know if it was Katie Smith or Rebekkah Brunson, but it was something that they asked for and it was a really good call."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it felt like we got a second chance. Obviously you don't want to be put in that position. Wish I wouldn't have fouled. Wish it wouldn't have been called, whatever it was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"But yeah, you're not thinking about that in the second. You're just thinking making sure they didn't get the rebound, making sure we're boxing out and going to our next play. So yeah, that's what I was thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I didn't know she was here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"She was texting to the bench. A lot of the good stuff we did, she was sending laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"The games that we were talking about, we were up. We were managing leads. We weren't finishing well. The fundamental difference is we were down. So obviously we finish games better when we're down, based on the playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"But that was what I was referring to, was managing leads better, playing all the way through to the end of the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,Welcome to Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. I'm excited to be here in New York City as the Liberty take on the Minnesota Lynx.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you all know, the Liberty and Lynx were the two best teams in the WNBA all year, with both at the top of the standings for much of the season. The Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, are making their second straight Finals appearance and looking to win their first WNBA championship. Obviously, they won the Commissioner's Cup the other year 2023. The Lynx, one of the most decorated franchises in WNBA history, are looking to win a league-record fifth title and are appearing in a record seventh Finals. They're looking to become the second team to sweep both the Commissioner's Cup and the WNBA Finals trophy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With Napheesa having such a career year, along with the play in New York with Sabrina and Stewie and the storylines about Leonie Fiebich, her first year in the league, All-Rookie Team, and free-agency signings in Minnesota with Courtney Williams and Alanna Smith and so many more storylines, I'm just excited to get this tipped off."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Finals mark the culmination of what I think is the most transformational year in the WNBA's history. You saw all the statistics we put out viewership, attendance, merch sales, digital engagement at or near record levels. To put it in perspective with a few stats that bring insight into what has happened, the WNBA has significantly outpaced the industry in average consumption of live games in 2024. Fans watched 30 percent more minutes on average of each WNBA game in the 2024 regular season."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our games reached a record 54 million viewers in the 2024 regular season. Younger, more diverse audiences are imperative to the growth of the sports industry, and they flocked to the WNBA this season. Viewership by fans under 35 increased 211 percent, led by a 259 percent increase in viewership from Gen Z and millennial women."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our focus on our direct-to-consumer platforms led to record-breaking content consumption and repeated fan engagement. WNBA App downloads surpassed 1 million this year, and monthly active users skyrocketed 252 percent. Social engagement increased nearly 300 percent across all of our league channels. There was an astounding 872 percent increase in WNBA App story views, which I know I watch my kids watching all the little stories that we put out there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Last time we gathered for the Finals, in 2023, we had just announced the Golden State expansion franchise. Since then, we have announced two more expansion teams to begin play in 2026, Toronto and Portland, with one more team to begin play by no later than the 2028 season, to get us to 16 teams."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This summer we signed a groundbreaking media rights deal that will grow the economics of our league and expand the reach and accessibility of our game for our fans, with additional WNBA media deals to come."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you know, early in the season, after seeing the growth trajectory we were on and with a challenging game footprint given the Olympics, we implemented full charter flights for the entire season plus playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This growth has not come without growing pains. The hateful speech and threats directed at our players are troubling. That type of conduct is not representative of the WNBA's character or fan base. As a league, we stand united in condemning racism and all forms of hate. The WNBA is one of the most inclusive and diverse professional sports leagues in the world, and we will continue to champion those values."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll meet with the Players Association, the players, teams. We'll work together to expand and enhance our efforts and are going to approach this multidimensionally, utilizing technology, prioritizing mental health, reinforcing physical security and increasing monitoring. We know there's more work to be done, and as a league, we are fully committed to listening to the players and other stakeholders on this and other important issues."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Finally, before we get to your questions, we have some news to announce Starting next year with the 2025 WNBA season, the WNBA Finals presented by YouTube TV will be a best-of-seven format, replacing the current best-of-five format. The Finals will take on a 2-2-1-1-1 structure, in which the team with the higher seed will host Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, and its opponent will host Games 3, 4 and 6. This will give our fans a championship series format that they are accustomed to seeing in other sports."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We will also be changing our first round to a 1-1-1 setup for the best-of-three series. We have contemplated both these changes since the pandemic. We would have done it in the current year, but with the Olympic break this year, it wasn't possible. But now that we have charters throughout the season and playoffs, it's feasible. So to summarize, in 2025 we will have a best-of-three first round, five in the semifinals and seven in the WNBA Finals."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"In addition, the 2025 regular season will increase from 40 to 44 games per team. Honestly, the league's growth and increased demand for WNBA basketball made this the ideal time to expand the schedule, lengthen the Finals and provide fans more opportunities to see the best players in the world compete at the highest level."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I also want to take the opportunity to let you know that the WNBA Draft Lottery 2025 presented by State Farm will be broadcast on Sunday, November 17, at 5 p.m. Eastern on ESPN."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, I want to thank you for your coverage this year. It really has made a difference. I really am very grateful to be standing here as the commissioner of a league that has been through so much. To have you all in this room and reporting on this league as you have all year, very grateful for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, happy to answer any questions."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, first of all, there's no place in sports for this. Just continue to condemn it, continue to be a voice on this. Also, I think we have been already meeting with some technology providers. I think there are some technology solutions out there that we could deploy and employ. Of course, we want to meet with the players and see what they want to do around that. But there are some technology companies we've been meeting with to see what we can do. It just is something where we have to continue to be a voice for this, a voice against it, condemning it, and making sure that we find every opportunity to support our players, who have been dealing with this for much longer than this year, by the way. I think Sue Bird said that the other day very eloquently. We need to continue to see how we can support the mental health resources, physical security, cybersecurity."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're going to attack it, as I said, multidimensionally. We're going to try to figure out how we can best work with the players as to how they want us to help solve this issue."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, well, next year we do not have any international competition. No FIBA World Cup and no Olympic break, so we should have a nice footprint. It's hard to start much earlier because we obviously have the college season. The college draft is such a great feeder system into the WNBA and creates a lot of excitement, as you've seen over the past few years and probably since the league started."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think probably not starting much earlier. Certainly we're well into October by the time we finish the Finals, especially if we go to five games this year, next year seven. So we'll probably go a little bit later in October."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But again, we'll have a decent footprint next year to fit in the 44. Remember, we have an additional team joining next year, in Golden State Valkyries. So I think it'll be great. We'll have obviously the condensed Commissioner's Cup a few weeks, culminating in that championship, as well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think next year will be a good footprint. We'll have to look at the following year because that is the FIBA World Cup year. Obviously, we'll be good in 2027, and then it'll be LA '28. It's a constant balancing of the schedule. I think we feel very good about where we'll be next year, for sure, on the footprint."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So that date in November was draft lottery, not the draft. Yes."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Golden State Valkyries will pick fifth in each round. The lottery picks will be the four teams that you probably have already done the calculations on, but we'll obviously put a release out after this press conference on exactly that, and then the Golden State Valkyries will have the fifth pick in each round."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's a good question on what's next as it relates to our globalization platform. Obviously, we played Toronto, we played in Edmonton. That was kind of our Canada series. Now we'll have a team in Toronto starting in '26. Sure, we'd like to play in more places -- EMEA, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America, I know Mexico City has shown interest, as well as a variety of other cities across the world."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, I was in Paris for the Olympics this year. Thought it was amazing, the support for women's basketball there. I'll never forget on the Friday night when Belgium played France in the women's game. I'd say that was the best crowd that I saw watch a game there. Obviously, a lot of Belgians could drive there to Paris."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It was great to see the growth of the game globally. I think our players represent such great role models to those communities in lifting women. I've admired what the NBA has done with their Global Games platform, playing around the world. I think we'll be on a path there as we get into 2025 and beyond."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That will be something I'm sure in collective bargaining that we'll sit down with the players and Players Association. I think one thing that you noticed in the last year or two, particularly this year, a lot of our veterans were in camp, training camp. Obviously, they have to show up by May 1, and I think it was important. I think you saw the quality of the game in the first few weeks because of that. I also think you saw the quality of the Commissioner's Cup play, which is toward the front half of the season to give that some more relevance. Again, I'm sure it'll be something we continue to discuss and talk about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so again, we work with FIBA. We're working with all the constituents on how we can make this all work, where they can have vibrant, competitive seasons. We can have our vibrant, competitive season."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, some have moved their dates to end earlier to make sure that those vets -- remember, our prioritization rule does not apply to rookies in their first couple years, but for those vets to come over and play in the best league in the world."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But we have a good relationship with FIBA. Working through with them. And again, I think in 2025 -- that's another impediment to starting earlier, to the question about starting earlier, not only the college draft and college season going into the beginning of April, we need to have a training camp, but also the Euro leagues, as well, play into April now, into May."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think on balance, I think we all want to grow the game globally. I think it's going to come down to footprints and seasons and how we can do it, which is why most of what we're doing in expanding our season will be on the back end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, absolutely. We're always scenario planning around a variety of different outcomes. Certainly, I engage with Nneka and Terri throughout the year, every month, every other week during the season. I really respect the player leadership. I think this is going to be an opportunity to listen to one another and take this league to the next level for generations to come."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We actually look forward to engaging in that now that we've kind of gotten the media deal we discussed, corporate partners, just everything. There's virtually not a sporting event you can turn on where one of our players is not in an ad spot. That was not happening five years ago. Look at Aliyah Boston and Sabrina and A'ja and so many of our players in these ad spots. I think that's a good sign, too, as we think about the future of this game and the future of the agreement between the Players Association and the owners."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, one thing that as a very long-term sports fan I know is that officiating and refereeing is always at the top of the fan's list, of the media's list. Obviously, we work hard on training. We work hard on consistency. Obviously, not every -- they're humans."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Looking at technology, basketball is a little more complex than tennis, for instance, around technology, of officiating. We're looking at a variety of different dimensions, but we'll continue training. We have a lot of veteran officials. You'll see them out here working the Finals. But we always know there's always work to do, always get better. We review in our Competition Committee meetings, officiating and points of emphasis and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll caucus with Bethany Donaphin, our head of league operations, and our referee operations, as well. We'll caucus to make sure we're putting out the best officiating we can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But I know it's a passionate issue. Every fan group -- I love when I go into market and every fan group I meet with, they usually wait and ask it as the last question of the night. But they do ask about officiating, which I appreciate the passion for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So on your first question, we do hear from NBA players who are very interested in investing in WNBA teams. There's a lot of capital inflow coming into women's sports, as many of you are hearing and reading, and obviously we were one of the first and only to raise at the scale we did, 75 million back in 2022. We brought in former NBA players into that capital raise and former WNBA players into that capital raise. So yes, we do get interest from time to time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now, the NBA investments by those players is in independent teams, not in NBA-affiliated teams. So if you're still playing for an NBA team, you probably want to invest in the WNBA team with your affiliate, and you can't do that until you graduate, I'll call it, or retire from basketball. So we have a lot of interest from that perspective."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Then again, we want to listen to the players as to how they want to think about anything that we go to the bargaining table on, whether that's equity stakes or other issues that they might be interested in. We're certainly willing to listen. I think it is complicated when you have a Players Association versus the league versus the owners who are all small businesses, right. Well, 13, now we'll have 15 to 16, and they're each individual businesses. I think it's a little more complicated because there's no one equity stake. Like Unrivaled, it is one league with equity stake in, and it's not teams. We've got 12, soon to be 16, teams in a league. So it's a little more complicated, I think."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that we look at for all of our teams every year, as well as you mentioned the expansion teams. I think my comments on the expansion teams were you want to make sure the expansion owners know, when you come into the league, it's a competitive league. Free agency is competitive now, and all of our owners are investing. You see investing in practice facilities and other player experiences. I think we want those expansion teams to come in and be the most successful they can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, you may have a different view, but I think our current owners are all growing in the same direction as far as how they know they need to get free agents to build a championship squad. Obviously great rookies, too, become veterans later on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I don't have a bias against any one team. Obviously, we have teams playing in different size arenas. You saw some teams upgrade those arenas for certain games this year, and I thought that was a sign and signal that as has attendance had a grown across the league that we can play in bigger arenas. I think when I came into this league, someone said you should all be playing in 5,000-seat arenas. Can you imagine what you're going to see out here tonight if that was in a 5,000-seat arena? No, there's going 17,000-plus people here. And we had our highest-attended game ever, over 20,000, in Washington this year."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we do have standards, by the way, across the board for facilities, practice facilities and things like that. The owners now know that there's an edge to showing a player investment in the things like facilities, et cetera, especially practice facilities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I was in Phoenix for the All-Star Game this year taking a tour of their new practice facilities that they opened. Vegas has done it, Seattle has done it, Dallas is going to do it. I think Phoenix I mentioned, and Chicago is looking at upgrading. I think all of our -- we already had some great practice facilities already in the league in Indy, Minnesota, et cetera, and here in New York."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, again, there's no -- we do have standards, but there's nothing where we're saying any one owner is not up to their standards today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so just in general for the 16th spot, as I've mentioned, the good news is we have a lot of demand from many cities. I'd say 10 or so, maybe even plus at this point, because I think the more people are watching the WNBA and seeing what we're growing here and seeing these players and the product on the court, more people are interested in having it in their cities. They see the economic impact of having a WNBA team in their city, the role model in the community these players represent."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I've said Philly is on the list, and Philly is on the list. Now that we have the three teams, two in '26, one next year, we're not in a huge rush. We'd like to bring it in in '27 or no later than '28, as I mentioned. So I'd say there's 10 to 12 cities that are very viable that we're evaluating, and we have a process. I'd say I don't have a deadline by which we have to name it because it'll be out to '27 or '28, but I would think in the next couple months or so we'll start -- now as we get into the offseason, we'll start taking a look at those that will go to the top of the list through our process."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, it's all the same types of things I've been talking about for the other three around arena, practice facility, player experience, committed long-term ownership group, city, demographics, psychographics, Fortune 500 companies based there. All the things we've been looking at in all of our cities and our data analysis. And then we've built some good relationships with some of the potential cities as they've started to engage with the league on an expansion team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think if you look at the diversity of when we did our capital raise, you'll see a fair amount of diversity in the ownership group we brought in there, investor group."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, we talk with our owners all the time about diversity in the coaching ranks, in their front office, back office, et cetera. You see every year we score very well in our report on that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We have a lot of assistant coaches that have been previous WNBA players and represent a very diverse group, as well. We have all of our owners partnering with minority-owned businesses. We partner at the league with Mielle, who is one of our newer partners. Playa Society. I think one of our teams just got a Partake Foods jersey patch that's a minority-owned business."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're looking at it from all these angles, partnerships, ranks of our employee base and certainly the coaching diversity and coaching, as well. So it is important to us. There's not a Board of Governors meeting that we don't talk about this. As you know, we've made enormous progress especially in the assistant coaching ranks with former WNBA players by essentially focusing on this over the last couple years. Made enormous progress, which is why our report card is really good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But it's something that you can never rest on, so I appreciate the question. We've had a couple coaches exit, so I think we have three open coaching spots. Obviously, the Golden State Valkyries announced their first head coach in their franchise history today. We have three open coaching spots. So we'll certainly be looking for our owners to have a diverse pool of candidates, and ultimately they'll make the decision on their head coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"We just take it on the chin, you know. We were up a lot and then we had a wild kind of sequence to end the fourth. Didn't start overtime great. I had a great look at the end and I didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"But I think that this is a series. We wanted to really win, obviously, for home court. But the beauty is, we have another game on Sunday and we'll be ready."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, it's probably a lot of things. I could probably give you a better answer tomorrow. I just thought we went away from our principles of play. I think we had a great first quarter, and then they lifted up the energy and they outhustled us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think we forced some of the action. We weren't moving it good enough. We couldn't get downhill as much. You know, we missed a lot of shots. We missed a lot of shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Just the principles of play for us. How we want to play, get to the next action."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, defensively, I think they executed better than us. That's what it came down to. They executed better than us. They found a way to win. They made some big shots, timely shots when they needed to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,We're disappointed. We have to be better. We're a better team than what we showed today.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think it's pretty clear, JJ had an amazing game, and the way that she was aggressive from start to finish is exactly what we need."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we got a lot of looks. Like, 90 shots is a lot, and we missed them. I think just coming out and understanding the game plan a little bit better, and always being on our front foot. I felt like there was just a few situations, time and score toward the end of the game, that really hurt us. But collectively there's a lot of things that you could kind of look at and be like, well, this is one of the reasons why we lost."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they took us out of what we wanted to run. They were really aggressive. They were blowing up stuff. We couldn't get clear passes. We tried to go downhill and they would stunt and get back, and we just got a little bit stagnant. Then we had obviously -- I thought we were slow. We were up so you're trying to move the ball, but then we are slow in our speed, execution speed, and then it was making it easy for them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And they made plays. They made plays down the other end. Obviously we contested it -- we give them a three, a four-point play. Those things, they can break your back, and they did. We had our opportunities to win and we didn't finish it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We're disappointed. We have to go back to work. We have to freshen up. We have to look at how we can be better, and it's really just principles of play. Things that we have been great at all season long, we have to just refocus on them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think the missed free throw because we had an opportunity to go up one. But even still, at the end of overtime, I had probably one of my cleanest looks. Didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"I mean, they switched with us a little bit more to stop us from going downhill. I don't know, I think the weight of the game was more about us, like Sandy said, getting away from our principles versus what they did to kind of get us out of rhythm."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they were throwing different coverages at her, with the switching and she was trying to go probably a little bit too much one-on-one early. We've just got to move the ball and trust that the ball will come back to her in that regard and exploit it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We had a tough night. We had a tough shooting night. We all did. But what I know, Sabrina is a competitor. She'll get ready for Game 2 and come back strong."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I want to be taking these shots. I feel like knowing my teammates and that everyone has confidence in me is important. It's kind of like on to the next and still making sure I'm aggressive any time on the court. Obviously as a player, it's very frustrating. But bounce back for Game 2."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"It was a point of emphasis for us coming into the game, just to control the rebounding and really get on the boards and try to exploit them in that way. It's something that we're going to have to continue to do to be successful."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"But like Stewie and Coach said, we had a lot of opportunities to close the game out. A few things that we have to change and kind of be aware of moving forward, but still some things to build upon and things to learn from."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, a hundred percent. It's principles of plays at both ends. Being at the point of the screen, Kayla McBride is coming off and shooting it, and then letting them go downhill, pressuring and letting Hiedeman dribble by us and giving them too many easy looks where we should have been just a little bit smarter in our defense there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,Sometimes when we didn't rebound or we kind of -- we went to offensive rebound but we are out of position and they got easy layups in transition. So those really break your back.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Principles of play in the half court. Pace is there, but I think we got a little stagnant and a little tired. But credit to them. They were blowing us up and they were being really physical. They were very active. They were switching it, and then that took us out of it a little bit. We've got to be better and we will be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think it's, specifically to that play because they were reviewing the time, you're just focusing on making the shot. Making the first one. Making the first one. Making the first one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"And then the second one, the same. It's when you want to be thinking about nothing else. It definitely sucks to miss."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,I think just the start we did have. We put up 32 points. We were very intentional playing defense. We were making it really hard for them to score. Some easy baskets. We were making shots and moving the ball really quick.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,But they went to another level. So they kind of took us out of a rhythm. Not surprised us. We knew what they are capable of doing. But we've got to get back and just play Liberty basketball.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely a little bit anxious. A little bit nervousness in there, just because I had no idea where I was going. I kind of told my agent to keep it a secret from me. I just want to be surprised."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"For me, I just wanted to land somewhere that would develop me and kind of make me into the best basketball that I can be. I'm happy that I landed with Utah. Definitely excited. Felt relief when I heard my name called, so that's probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think the biggest way I fit in is just my versatility. When you come in at such a young age, and being able to play multiple positions and guard multiple positions, I really feel like that allows you to fit in with the dynamic of the team just because you can do so much and fit in with different needs. That's the biggest part."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,There's a lot of talented guys on that team. I could go down the list and do their whole lineup that I can fit in with. But the biggest thing is they are young and I could develop and learn with them and kind of build that young core. That's probably the part I'm most excited about with this team.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Just being himself really. I feel like that's how he differentiates himself on and off the court and really made a name for himself. Being himself includes not only his personality but also his work ethic and how hard he worked to get to where he is and where he is going to continue to go to.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I feel like just taking those aspects of his game and his mentality, how he approached every workout, every rep, every charity event, every media coverage, I feel like I can use that and take that with me and use it throughout my career. That's how I'm going to grow and develop."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"It's something we dreamed about. As kids, obviously we never really got to play against or with each other on the same team just because of the age difference. So I think being able to do that now is definitely a dream come true. I'm going to make sure I'm matched up on him when we're playing them. Make sure, tell Will, put me on Jalen Williams. That's the game plan."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think it just goes to show the type of parents I have and the type of people I have in my life and my family members, just the values they installed in both of us. That's why we ended up this way. So I know they are extremely proud watching us reach our dreams. That's the biggest thing for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"We practiced it a lot, I'm not going to lie. Two years ago, we messed it up. We were practicing for a few days, maybe even a week up until this point, to make sure we nailed it. Add a little flair to it. So we made up for it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I've just got baby steps into the fashion industry, I'm not going to lie to you. This is the first time I stepped out and wore something expensive. I think for me it might be something a little hobby I'll pick up, but I'm just starting to get into fashion and just starting to figure it out. I'll probably learn from him as I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, it's hard to say just because we play two different styles of basketball. I don't know what your definition of better is. I hope to become an elite two-way player, playing offense and defense and doing that at the highest level and being one of those elite two-way players in the NBA, as I go throughout my career."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I strive to be better than him. Obviously a little sibling rivalry, but we also play like completely different just with the way our bodies are built. So you know, that's the answer you're looking for."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely gaming. I would say gaming, for sure, is one of the biggest ones. Fashion, stepping into it a little bit."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I'm a huge movie guy. That's something I always been into. Just pick up a movie and watch it. I love cinematography, so that's definitely probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I like bowling and starting to pick up golf too. Have a lot more free time, so I can start getting good at golf and getting a routine for it. But definitely bowling is another activity I'm heavy on."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, probably. And a lot of family time. That's probably going to be a heavy dose of it, spend as much time as I can with friends and family, while also obviously staying locked in on basketball. But enjoying the moments with them before the season gets hectic and I'm going to be traveling all over the place."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, go to this afterparty. That's probably the biggest thing. I'm looking forward to enjoying that. Got all my closest friends and family there. I guess that's on my bucket list to enjoy."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"It was a surreal feeling. I mean, especially just sitting in that chair waiting, just to figure out which team was going to get me. For them to pick me, a lot of emotions were just going through me. I'm definitely blessed."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"All of them are hardworking. They push their players past their limits. I feel like that's the best place for me. Especially with me going there, I know they are going to push me past my limits, push me past that wall to be the best player that I can be and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"Well, like you said, they have their trust in Bam. So I feel like once they have trust with me, it comes with me showing them that in practice. I feel like that's something that would elevate my game, just having that trust in me that I go out and make the right plays."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"A lot of people go into the transfer portal for money. I went in there for the right fit and I found the right fit. That definitely helped my career. Going into my sophomore season, actually getting to know the coaches. Just learning more things about the team just before I made the decision."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,I've got to go with Drake. OVO. OVO.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, I think the more I develop, I'll definitely be able to initiate offense at the one. Played two and three before. I think playing in the NBA, playing around in practice, I think I'll start to get used to it more, and then I think I can really take that role to the next level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"I've never been to Toronto. I've never even been to Canada. But I know that it's a nice city in Canada, and all I really know is the building."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, the guards, we're a close group at Baylor. Every year, there's six guards. Y'all are competing against each other every day. Y'all are getting better watching a lot of film. We actually do call it Guard U."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,Me being the next one out is a blessing from God. I'm just super grateful to be in this position and I hope that I'm going to represent Baylor well.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, just excited to meet all the players and to speak to the coaches, to meet them, meet the front office. Just excited to go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, they are very incredible and talented. I'll try to fit in there. I'm young. I'll learn a lot probably. I'm really grateful for the opportunity."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"I did not visit Oklahoma. Every organization that I've been to, I met some really nice people. That is with Oklahoma, also. Very, very nice coach. GMs, everybody, I'm just excited to meet them in person and talk to them. And yeah, that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, it was great. But I had injuries, so sadly, I didn't play more. But I tried to take my time and to be with them, to talk with them, even with the injury."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"So yeah, I really enjoyed it there. I made some really good friends and friendships forever. But as I said, I'm sad that I didn't have that opportunity to play more with them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Just that I'm ready, that I'll give 150 percent of myself for every ball, every possession, every time on defense. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, I talked with Micic. He just told me everything the best about not just the Thunder, but the whole NBA. And of course, Durisic, Nikola and I got really close this year. I really enjoyed playing with him. It was easy, as I can say. I hope he will get drafted as high as possible."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,It meant a lot that I had him here. We were together in Miami. We shared some good memories at times. We visit some places. It's great to have him here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Not yet. I've been coming back slowly. But we'll talk tomorrow with the team and the team doctor and see what's the best for me, and we'll do that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Nikola is one of the most popular names in Serbia. So yeah, maybe. There's a lot of Nikolas, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"That I'm really funny person. That I want to spend time with my friends. At home with my family, we have movie nights. We enjoy watching movies and TV series."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"He just told me, ""Welcome, teammate."" That means a lot for me because he accepted me. He stood up to shake my hand. It's really great to have him there. He's coming into the third year, and he's done a really good job the past two. And not just him, the players and the whole organization. I think we can do more."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"It was unbelievable. It was a dream come true. It's something that I've been dreaming of since I've been a little kid. Having my family with me at the table, my coach, my agent, having my family in the crowd, I couldn't ask for anything else. It was my mom's birthday today, so that's an awesome thing to celebrate as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,I'm at a loss for words. I'm super happy to be here and super thankful.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I never had a baseball team because there was no baseball team close to Kentucky, but I think I'm going to be an Astros fan now."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited. They have a really good thing going in Houston. The coach is really good. Like you said, Jalen. They have a bunch of really young, athletic guys, and we'll be able to play fast. It's going to be fun."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited to get out there and learn and take it all in, so I can't wait."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is just going in and learning. You have guys like Fred VanVleet that I'll be able to learn from. Just going in with an open mind, ready to learn, ready to do whatever it takes to win. Just compete and go in and have fun and continue to get in the gym and work on everything that I need to work on."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,I'm super excited. I can't wait to get to Houston and get the thing started.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"He didn't say that, but now that you say that, that is pretty good that that's a thing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,Thank you.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,It just shows the amount of talent that we have in France. I'm really excited for Zacc. I think our national team is really going to be good.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Yeah, I think it's really special. Any pick that you get picked, you know the team is taking a chance on me and I'm really blessed for that and I won't take it for granted."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Doing it in front of my family and them be able to come to New York, it just means a lot."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"I'm just excited to join this team. It's a team that I watched a lot this past year. I think I can be really impactful on that team, and I can't wait to add my game to the roster."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Yeah, it helped a lot. My dad, he always loved basketball and he looked at basketball -- he never was happy after one of my games. He always had something to say for me to improve on it. I think that's what made me and my brother good players. I can't thank them enough for this."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"I mean, I think it's just a first step, but it's definitely achieving something that was big for me. You know, being drafted, I don't take it for granted and I'm sure enjoying it a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"Yes, we want the best version possible. I would say it's natural. We are like that. We work hard. We have a lot of energy. We want to be the best. For sure, we are going to continue to be like that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I think the basketball in France has improved, and that's why we are here in this draft. Three French players in the top 10, it's not nothing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I know Zaccharie because I've played against him since I was 15. He played against me when I was at Cholet and him at ASVEL. Alex, I don't really know him."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I'm going to share a lot of moments with my family, with my friends, and after, we will see. I don't really know what I'm going to do."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I know a lot of French players have played with this team in Charlotte. I'm the next one. I will bring all my fire to the club and be ready to play with some players, like you say, LaMelo Ball. Some alley-oops, yeah. I'm ready to jump and put the ball in the rim."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I had a workout a couple weeks ago. I really enjoyed the time that I spent with them trying to understand their philosophy. As soon as we were talking, kind of understand more about the organization."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Just start to present myself and told them what I was ready to do for them. I was saying that I wanted to contribute to -- I want to be a part of a winning team and contribute to winning and compete. For that, I say that I was ready to do whatever it takes to do it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Basically my versatility could be -- defensively in this league is really important. Trying to guard multiple positions, trying to be aggressive. I will know more soon, but now that's what I've got to say right now."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"That's amazing. We are trying to represent our country, and I'm so glad to be a part of it. There is more players coming in. I'm really proud of being a part of the success of my country. Trying to understand what Victor, Rudy or other French players really help me to develop myself as a player, first of all, in France, and hopefully now in the NBA."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,I'm not shocked. I'm not shocked. I've known Tidjane and Alex for a long time. We grew up playing against each other. So I know them really well.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Like I said, that's amazing for our country. That's amazing for us, first of all. Just to be able to realize our dream together is special. I feel like French players are going to take some inspiration, and that's going to be better and better for us. I really feel lucky because there's so many young players that are good. That's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I'm a versatile player. I feel like I can fit easily into this team. I can't wait to figure out what is going to be my role or my goals, or, you know, just to make sure we win games."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"So I don't know yet, but I know that I can do a lot of things. Defend multiple positions, grabbing some rebounds, finishing strong, being aggressive, shooting threes obviously. I think that's going to be -- that's a part of my game. That's something that I need to keep it up for helping the team to win the next season, because I know that we are going to have to shoot the ball. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"For now, I just want -- I just know the facilities of the Hawks. I can't wait to get in there and to just work in those conditions. I think that's a style of life that I'm not used to. I talk about the gym, the cold baths, locker room, whatever. I feel like if I could basically sleep in the gym. In Bourg-en-Bresse, which is a great gym, too, but not as good as the Hawks have. I can really sleep in the gym."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"The workout went well. It was probably one of my favorite ones, actually. I just really liked the coaching staff and the organization in general. I had an opportunity to spend time with them, and just being able to talk with them and interact with them. They just talked about the plan and what they are thinking about next year, and then what they are looking for in a big."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"And then obviously the workout, they gave me some advice on how to get better. I just love the organization, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"I haven't been playing basketball that long. I'm still learning each and every day, every time I step on the court."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"Obviously, I wasn't ranked and it wasn't something I was paying attention to. To be honest, I was trying to have fun on the court. Obviously, brought me from Cameroon all the way to here. You never know where the basketball can take you. Just being here is amazing. It's a blessing and I have to thank God to be able to put me in this position."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"Oh, for sure. According to everyone, they have the best food in the U.S. I remember going on my visit, I really liked it. I can't wait to get to know them a little bit more and just spend time with them on the team and just get to work, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Not really. I feel like my game is dissected very much so, whether it's being non-athletic, non-defender. So it's something I take as a challenge. I'm used to it by now, going to the biggest platform at Duke. You get used to it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,I'm just excited to embrace the challenge and embrace the process and have fun with it. It's a blessing to even be here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm just excited to learn from him, learn from both Maxey and him. Obviously they are elite scorers, so I think I can space the floor and create space for them. I'm excited to get to know them and learn as much as possible from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm excited. Obviously Maxey, I've heard great things about him. Watching him on the court, he's an elite player. Being able to play alongside him and learn from him. On draft night, there's surprises everywhere. So I didn't know where I was going. I tried not to get attached to any teams. So yeah, I guess it is a surprise, but I'm happy to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Not yet. I sent Maxey my number, and I got to talk to the GM, the coach. Not too much. But I'm excited to get to know them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I think it's my natural emotion, is just to be happy, be joyful. So there's no reason to change that when I'm on the court. I'm always going to embrace the challenge, obviously, but I'm going to have fun with it. Whether I make a three, make a good play, the team is excited, the crowd is excited. I'm going to be smiling probably no matter what. So it's something I bring everywhere I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I'd say my why is I feel like I've been underrated my whole entire life ever since I was coming out of high school. I've always had a chip on my shoulder, and to this day I'll always have that chip on my shoulder to go out there and prove people wrong."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, I would say to all the kids out there that don't have offers, you don't have to be the highest-rated kid in your class or whatever. You could always go junior college or whatever type of route and be different. You can make your own path and find your way."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"It feels great, to play with one of the greats to ever touch a basketball. It's going to be exciting to go put on a show for L.A."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, like you said, AD is there. I get to learn from one of the greatest in LeBron and AD to help me each step of the way on both sides of the floor. I'm excited just to go out there and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Learning how to take care of my body constantly. I would say that's the biggest thing I was focusing on, and just kind of being around those type of NBA guys that have been there and done that. So just kind of learning from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I would say it's a mixture. I was just trying to be the best version of myself, and try to always push myself to be better and be better than yesterday."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, I remember that clip. I woke up and rolled out of bed and I thought it was fake because tons of people were texting me. I was just like, there's no way."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"Yeah, that's really exciting. At Tennessee, I watched a lot of JJ Redick with Coach Barnes. Just the way he moves and paces himself, and was able to create space. So hearing that, it's going to be really exciting and really special."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I would just say playing with a chip on my shoulder. Every single time I touch a basketball or walk into a gym, I always feel like I've got something to prove."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"It doesn't matter where I'm at. It's always going to be there, having that chip on my shoulder, feeling like I've been underrated for my whole life. It's something I'm going to carry with me the rest of my career."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"A hundred percent. I feel like there's no feeling like it. Just having all the people that have been a part of your journey since the beginning and seeing you grow. I feel like there's nothing like having them here with me and experiencing this with me and supporting me. There's no feeling like it, honestly."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"No, a hundred percent. I'm super proud of myself just sticking through that Australian season, knowing things were not going my way but continue to believe in myself every single day, and keep taking steps and getting better and looking at the bigger picture of my career. I feel like it's a great experience of being out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like Milwaukee was one of my best workouts I had. Even in the interviews at the combine and stuff like that, the interviews went really well. They just seemed like they had my best interests and they really liked me. So yeah, I kind of felt a little bit like Milwaukee would be the team that would want me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I would say that you just got to sometimes really just pop out and just show people, for real. You've just got to not want to duck or be scared. Believe in yourself more than anything and show people all the hard work that you've been putting in and the vision that you see and just put it out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like him coming in the tenth game of the season for us as a team and giving us a lot of freedom and a lot of trust, I feel like it really helped our team as a whole just play better in general with the players we had. He was a big part of our team's success, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,There's no feeling like it. It's surreal to me. Trying to soak it in. But it's truly a blessing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"Like I said before, it's just really truly a blessing to have players that you're really close with that are at the level that you want to be at and are doing the things that you want to do on the court. Just to have them to pick their brains and receive advice that they are giving me, I feel like it's truly a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Yeah, it's all in the process there. The coaches there, the people are just amazing. Dayton does a great job of giving you the right pathway. It's all up to you if you choose to believe in that or not."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"So they did that with me, Toumani Camara, Obi Toppin and all the guys before that. I decided to choose and I believe in it, and I'm here where I am now because of that. Very grateful for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"It was pretty cool. Great to see those players and a lot of great talent in there. I'm just happy to be where I'm at. Perfect fit. I'm very excited. I was excited the whole time. A little nervous. Great to see all my boys there watching me, but it's just great to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Great fit. I saw something that I get free nuggets from Wendy's. That's pretty cool. Other than that, I'm excited to get out there and play. It's a great team and a great organization for a reason. I'm going to get better and keep going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Probably an inhaler because I heard that -- what's it called, the altitude? I'm playing. I'll be all right."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"It means a lot coming from that program. Knowing that program just got shut down and I was the last bunch of that. Definitely taught me a lot on and off the court, really a lot of the things about life and being mentally healthy and just learning how the NBA operates."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"On the court, this might be surprising to say, but all the losing that we did, I definitely learned a lot more than if we would have won a lot. I think that definitely prepared me a lot for the NBA because you're going to go through a lot of things with the NBA. It's going to be a lot of things that you need to be able to talk about or just have an outlet to and just being able to figure things out quickly just to move on to the next."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I'm looking forward to changing things around. I know they have a stigma on them when it comes to a lot of losing, and I feel like I'm a huge part to be able to start to change that around. I have a willingness to win and I feel like me going into this franchise, being able to help them out with this good group of guys, good group of young guys that they have, I'm definitely super excited to get down there and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I appreciate all the love and support you've given me throughout the whole season, and I'm finally here and I wouldn't be here without y'all."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Like I said, I really appreciate all the love and support and all the competitive people in the G League. I appreciate y'all. It was a huge honor being able to play, going straight out of high school. I'm definitely blessed and honored to be in the situation I'm in."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"What excites me is really the basketball portion of it, for sure. I heard you have a huge fan base when it comes to basketball, so that's definitely something I'm looking forward to getting into. I'm a huge community guy, so I definitely see myself getting into that community as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I would say just talk to everybody that has been with me throughout this whole process and really sit down and tell them how thankful I am for that. I've been through so much. Just being able to be here, blessed with this opportunity God has put me in. I'm super thankful for everyone who has been part of my journey."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KYSHAWN GEORGE,"They are expecting hard work. Obviously, I can provide that. Just overall, like I said before, my versatility, shooting ability, spacing the floor and how smart I am with the ball."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"Everything that I thought of came to life. Flashbacks from when I was young. Just dreaming of being in this position, walking across that stage in my mind. Hearing my name be called and walk across the stage today, it all came true. It was just God gave me this to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"It helped me a lot. That program at Lu High was probably the best decision I made, to go for my two years' program. I'm forever grateful to Coach John Buck and Coach Josh Corbin to give me an opportunity to play there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,Their practices are like college practices. So I was prepared to go into that. Just having the competitive mindset helped me a lot.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"I think it was Coach Bennett. I wasn't really known as a good defender coming out of high school. Once I got to UVA and had my growth spurt, I think I got some God-given talents. Coach Bennett drilled that mindset in me, and I was able to take off at Virginia."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"I'm excited. I'm excited. Great program. They want to win a championship and they have got great players to do it. I'm going to try to get down there, go to work and see what I've got to do to get there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"Yeah, I think I can. It's just getting a lot of reps in practice and everything like that. Just getting the confidence and just let it go. That's what I'm going to try to do in Phoenix, is be in the gym a lot. Just do what I've got to do as a team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,I am. Born and raised.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"It's crazy because he lives in Arizona as well. We are both going to be in the same state again living together. It's going to be good. Being from New York representing not only as two athletes but as brothers in different sports, it's amazing and I'm grateful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,He's actually in Arizona. That's where he's staying. He's rehabbing on that.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's just a blessing, for real, to even be here because you work your whole life and you never know if you're going to make it. So when you finally get there, it's just a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"Yeah, playing with Anthony Edwards and the whole Timberwolves. They were in the Western Conference Finals. So it's really just a blessing because I get to learn from a lot of players and veterans and players that are real good. Them helping me is just a plus for me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I didn't really get to work out with them, but I used to see Ant at Overtime Elite a lot, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's a blessing to even be here in this situation. I thank the Timberwolves, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I would say the open space on the floor. There's so much open floor, and I feel like I'm quick so I can get past dudes. It's really the fact of me getting past dudes and making decisions. You're playing with a bunch of NBA players, so players can't really help off super a lot because these are NBA players and they knock down shots."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like, for me, getting past my defender and making plays for my teammates will be way easier, and then if they don't help, then it's just a bucket."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like it would be easier. Once I know the assignment and what my coach wants me to do, it's not really me adjusting. It's just me doing what he says. I feel like anything Coach tells me to do, I can adjust to and I can make it happen. So I feel like it's a good feel, for real."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"Me seeing Reed, my roommate, he's a great dude. He always pushed me and he always helped me. Me seeing him and we going together, it's just crazy to even see, and I'm thankful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Honestly, the workout went pretty well. I knew they were interested, but until the last minute, I didn't know where I was going. I'm very excited to start working. I can't wait."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,No. I'm planning on playing here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Obviously, I talked to the people over there. I got to learn more about the team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I was in the facility, everything. They showed me around. It was nice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think it's beautiful. I took a lot of risk. I left France when I was 17. So I did the last two years in Germany. I felt like it was a risk, and I believed in myself. I worked a lot and stayed confident."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Yeah, it's kind of crazy. I played with everybody. It's nice seeing your country being one of the most represented in the NBA. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of everybody. The French people that went to the NBA, it's big. It's coming from a different continent. We have to really work to get there. Yeah, I'm really proud of everybody."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"First, I would definitely say my brother, six years older. He was already playing basketball. But my first favorite player was probably KD."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think I'm really versatile, but I can also bring what a rookie needs to bring in a team. Bring some energy. Being able to grab a rebound, push the ball but also knock down shots. I think it's very important for a rookie to bring these things."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I don't know anybody personally on the team. But I talked with the coach, yeah."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"And yeah, it was nice to see him. I'm used to seeing him on TV. It was a little different, but I enjoyed it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I feel like I fit in great. I'm going to make sure that I get myself adjusted to whatever the team needs, whatever the players on that team need for us to be successful. With my high IQ and my versatility, I feel like there's a lot of different spots that I can fill and a lot of different needs I can address."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Basketball IQ, for sure. Making the right reads. Making smart plays. Being in the right position. I feel like that's very underrated, being in the right position and reading your defender. That's a lot of my game where I get my advantages from."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I'm going to continue it do that, and I feel like that's going to help everybody else on the floor as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Right, to the efficiency point. I feel like that's huge for me, just because I like to play the right way. I feel like me playing the right way is me getting good shots, whether that's open shots or good layups at the rim. I feel like I'm just reading the game and adjusting to whatever the defense does. When I get a good look, it's more prone to go in than not."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"And then to your other point, hopefully we'll make it three. That would be really historic. Yeah, Colorado is not looked at as a draft pick-producing university like these other programs are. But if you look at the history, there's a lot of really, really solid players that have stuck around a long time in the league. It's just a testament to what Coach Boyle and his coaching staff have done at Colorado."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,I'm excited to get to know them even more. We've got mutual friends. I've met them for the first time this past summer when my brother was playing on the national team and I went up there to Berlin to watch one of the games.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"But great people. They know my brother more than they know me, but they have already reached out to me through mutual friends. They make it very comforting to come to Orlando."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I talked with him earlier today, or tonight. I'm super excited, just learning from one of the great coaches. I feel like there's a lot that I can expand my game in, and I can't wait to learn even more. I feel like talking basketball and talking basketball IQ is one of my passions, as well, in the game. I'm just super excited to soak up all that knowledge and kind of grow."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"It's a blessing being here in the NBA Draft. One of many guys, and I'm just blessed to be in this space."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"I'm looking forward to playing with everybody, to be honest. I've heard a lot of great things about Utah. I'm just looking forward to learning a lot about it and living there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,I've never been to Utah. I don't think so.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"They are about to get a dog. I'm just looking forward to going in there and competing from day one, showing what I can do and just prove myself in the league in general."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, I mean, I'm really proud of Steph, happy for Steph. As a freshman, for him to come in and do what he did, help lead that team to another national title, is something very hard to do as a freshman. I love that kid to death. I'm extremely happy for him, and I'll be his biggest fan this year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it's been a crazy two years, from winning one national title to winning the Big East regular season to the Big East Tournament and then winning another national title. A lot of winning, a lot of succeeding the past two years. I feel like I'm going to keep that chip on my shoulder and go into Portland with just a lot of confidence, with a willingness to learn and get better every single day."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,I just want to have an impact and try to help this organization win and get to the top and try to win championships.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm really excited. I feel the connection with some of these young guys I've watched since I was in high school. Scoot Henderson, in particular. I feel like we have a chance to do something really special."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm young. Having a young team, just growing up around the same age, everyone learning and getting better every day, I'm really excited. I feel like I'm at a loss for words right now. I don't even know what else to say. I'm just excited and extremely blessed for this opportunity, and I'm really ready to get to Portland and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Being able to space the floor, knock down the three ball, playmake at a high level. I feel like I can handle the ball at the top of the key, pass the ball at a high level and I can shoot the ball at a high level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,One thing about me is I want to be a great teammate. I want to be the best teammate. I want to be the best player that Coach wants to coach every day. Coach is happy about coaching him because he gives his all. I want to be that guy. I'm just ready to get to work.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,It's a great feeling. You dream of this moment your whole life. You watch it on TV every single year. To have that moment here in front of you today and to hear my name called is something that I'll remember for the rest of my life.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"That was a really special moment. Like I said, I'm extremely blessed and grateful for everyone that has helped me to get to this point. I'm ready to get to work and ready to learn and ready to try to impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yes, I just did."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"It was great. I like Coach a lot. When I went out there for my visit, he was a good dude, great dude. The whole staff, the whole organization, you can really tell people that want to learn and want to win and learn and get better. That's something -- that's what I'm about, and I'm really ready to go get going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,Too young.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it just shows that we were the best program in college basketball and they still are right now. Coach Hurley is the best coach in college basketball, and he's producing players at a high level every single year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm not sure the exact number of draft picks he's had these past five years, but Coach Hurley has been the top of the top in college for a couple years now. I love that man to death."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,No. Just spend some time with some family. Soak everything in. Realize my life is going to change forever.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"They always told me that they were super high on me. But of course it's the NBA Draft, so you can't make any promises to anybody."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just can't wait to get out there and show my versatility, especially with the kind of talent that we already have on that team. It being the youngest team in the league right now, I feel like our future is pretty bright. I just can't wait to get out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"It's really hard to prepare for that moment. I mean, it's just a lot of emotions running through your head, especially when you hear your name being called."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"But on the basketball side of things, just always keep your head down, always working. Just staying humble and just having all that self-confidence in myself that everything is going to work out."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,I was just playing for the best coach in college basketball and now flipping to the NBA and going to play for a legendary coach like Coach Pop. It's a blessing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"On the culture side of things, it's not really a big culture change from UConn to San Antonio. Just being out there in the pre-draft process, you can tell it's a hardworking program and super hard-nosed. I just can't wait to go out there and just show what I got."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Everything is just happening like really, really fast. Just being in the natty, soaking in that moment with my teammates, that's a super big accomplishment. And flip over to a couple months later and you another one of your teammates are top-10 picks. It really means the world to me and I wouldn't trade this for anything."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just talked to him on the phone not too long ago. We were just talking about coming down to San Antonio and just can't wait to get to work, and just excited for our future and excited for this upcoming season."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"It means a lot. Me and D.C. have been through so much together. I was friends with him before I got to UConn, before I committed to UConn. I've known him forever now. I mean, I know how much he's been through."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"For that to happen, it's such a great reflection on our program and just it's a reflection on all the hard work that we've put in. It's really a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Nah, he didn't tell me that as soon as I got drafted. That's probably a conversations we'll have a little later."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,It's all good.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,That's a castle for my last name. This is a castle.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,And that's my initials right on the bottom.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,The last thing I'll do in probably just celebrate with my family. I was born here in New York. So I have a lot of family here at the draft. Just doing whatever I can to show how much appreciation I have toward them for all their support right before I go out to San Antonio and start my next journey.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Well, I mean, what I picked for the draft, it wasn't intentional. But I guess it all really worked out. I guess I kind of manifested it to happen for me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Oh, man, just want to thank God first, first and foremost, just for putting me in this position. I was ready to get ready to work. Coming in day one, do all the dirty work we need to do to win. I think I'm a winning player. I'm a win-now type of player, being one of the older guys in the draft. Just having that experience from college, and like I said, just doing all the dirty work, rebounding, diving on the floor for loose balls and just anything we need to do to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"I would love to play alongside Malik Monk, De'Aaron Fox, I think we have a great big in Sabonis, probably one of best passers in the NBA from a big standpoint."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"I'm just ready to be a two-way, versatile player. Get stops on one end, and I can also create some offense not only for myself but my teammates on the other end."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, I did work out for the Kings. Honestly, one of my better workouts, I believe. I think we had a very fantastic meeting with everybody who made the decision to draft me. Just very thankful for that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Me and Coach Brown talked, how we see myself fitting in on the team, and just coachplayer talk. I think I got a good feel for Coach and he got a good feel for me. Just ready to start in journey."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"It means everything. Just seeing his face whenever I got drafted, how happy he was, he didn't get a chance to get drafted. So just seeing his face and how excited he was for everything that we've been through, working out, countless hours throughout the night, morning. It's just a very special moment. Came up with handshake today and almost messed it up, but it's all right. We got it done."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, just me being confident, like I said, I know the type of player I am. I know what I bring to the court. I know I just wanted to give Kim the same promise he gave me when he first came to Providence, that he'll make me one of the better players in the conference. Just want to give him the same promise I got a seat for you at the green room table."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Just a mature, win-now, do-it-all type of player. Like I said, rebounding, dive on the floor, take charges, anything that is needed to do to win. Just very excited to play with some great players, and hopefully we can win a championship."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"I'm feeling about as good as you think I'd be feeling. It's a special feeling to finally be here and have my name called, and especially being so close to home. You know, that means a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"It means a lot. Definitely because I would say when I was younger, I wasn't really like that in my area, and to now be sort of that guy that people want to see, especially being from the area and now back in the area. It means a lot to finally see all the stuff that I've done come to light."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,I haven't even touched my phone yet.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"Definitely. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he has texted me already."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"Probably say he'll be at the first game, and ""Don't suck."" Something he would probably say to me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"For sure, yeah, he ain't got no choice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"I would say the biggest adjustment would be how they game plan. It's real strategic for the league. I'm starting to see that working out for all these different teams. They have a real game plan and strategy going into every single game, and if you don't execute it, you can't play. I feel like that's something I'm going to have to get adjusted to."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,Feeling good. Super blessed. I'm ready to work. I'm going to give the Bulls organization everything I've got.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"Super excited, man. I mean, this is a dream come true. I've been thinking about this since a young age. It means the world to me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"I'll dress well, but I'm worried about basketball. I'm not really worried about that. I want to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"Chicago is a winning program and I want to win. So being there, I can embrace it. I fit many different ways on the team. I feel like I can do everything on the court. Whatever Coach asks me to do, I'm going to do to the best of my abilities and I'm going to work hard."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,See my family. That's it.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"The program did an amazing job, even when they had the shutdown. Look at all the picks that they had. Everyone is good. All the coaches are amazing. They did a great job with everyone that they produced. I can't thank them enough, honestly. I would do it ten times over again."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"How do I feel it improved my game? Being around NBA coaches, veterans, just being in the NBA atmosphere, playing NBA rules and all that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Dove for the ball. Lively landed on me. I knew right away. I've chipped it in the past, so it's not new. But, like, I mean, this tooth is loose. The other two teeth are wiggling. They were trying stuff in the locker room. I was like, I don't care. Just play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"This is unreal. I don't think it really has hit and settled in. This is a special group of guys, a special coaching staff that I'm just thankful to be a part of. Yeah, it's unreal. I'm just trying to enjoy the moment and not get too lit laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"At the moment I got traded, I was -- I wouldn't say disappointed. But you're in San Antonio. That's all I knew."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Such a blessing to be a part of this roster. They just drive me in so many different ways, from top to bottom. I'm just so thankful and grateful for each and every one of them. They made me a better player and made me a better person. The city of Boston, everything, has just been amazing for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"Man, I love Joe Mazzulla so much. Coming off the year I had, and he gets the job, and he's like, You know what? I'm going to start you. Which I wasn't expecting. He was like, I believe in you and I trust in you. This is going to give you the confidence."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"And from that moment on, I think it's changed my whole career. I'd do anything for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a great teammate, a great competitor. I was happy for him that he was able to go out there. The crowd cheering him on like that just got him going. He's still 7-4 and can do so many different things here. He's special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a surreal feeling. Still has not really kicked in yet. Just trying, I guess, to enjoy the moment. I kept saying, ""Wow."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"These last seven years have been a roller coaster, up and down. I had to listen to all the s--- that people said about me, and tonight, it was worth it. Oh, my God."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, maybe getting drafted. That's something that you dream about. But this is at the top of the mountain. To be able to say we did it, that we came together and we won a championship. Banner No. 18 has been hanging over our head for so many years. To know that we're going to be engraved in history, and it still hasn't like registered. I'm just still trying to process it all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,But we did it. We won a championship.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"He told me that I was the best in the world. I said, ""You're damn right I am."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,Say that again.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,Please say that again laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"That it was -- it was -- all the sacrifice was worth it. I'm so thankful to have been in the positions that I was growing up. Thankful for my mom. Thankful for my dad introducing me to basketball. My grandmother who helped raise me. All my friends and family that have supported me, every coach, every teammate that I've had."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, this is going to be a night that I will remember for the rest of my life, from the game, the celebration, these moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, over the last couple years, we had some tough losses at home in the playoffs. We've lost the NBA Championship at home in front of our fans. We had a chance to beat Miami in Game 6 a few years ago and lost that one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So to have a big win, the biggest win that you could have in front of your home crowd, I felt like that was really important to go out there and do everything in my power to make sure we won this game tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"It took being relentless. It took being on the other side of this and losing in the Finals and being at literally the lowest point in a basketball career that you could be, to next year, to the following year, thinking that was going to be the time, and come up short again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So, I mean, people have said it before. But coming up short and having failures makes this moment that much better. Because you know what it feels like to lose. You know what it feels like to be on the other side of this and be in the locker room and hearing the other team celebrating, hearing them celebrate on your home floor. That was devastating."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"And now, to elevate yourself in a space that, you know, all your favorite players are in, everybody that they consider greats or legends have won a championship, and all of the guys I looked up to won a championship, multiple championships."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So now I can, like, walk in those rooms and be a part of that. It's a hell of a feeling. This is more -- I dreamed about what it would be like, but this is 10 times better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"First of all, congrats to him. Well-deserved. Extremely happy for him. This is a hell of an accomplishment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,The main goal for us was to win a championship. We weren't -- we didn't care who got Finals MVP. I know that I need him through this journey and he needs me.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"So, you know, it was great to see him have that moment and share that moment with him. I'm extremely happy for him. Well-deserved. That was big-time. He earned that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Man, from day one when I came in, my mindset was I'm going to give everything to this team and this city to try to win a championship here because I knew these guys have already been so close."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, once I got hurt, it was a heartbreaking moment for me. I didn't want to accept the truth. It was like, no way it happened, right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"But, yeah, tonight was the night. I was like, listen, I'm going to give it everything I have. And, yeah, I'm just super happy to be a part of this and give something to the team, and I'm super thankful for the support I've gotten from the fans. And tonight the arena was electric. It's been unbelievable playing in front of these fans."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know what, like since last game, I've been thinking about, like, how can I get my body ready for next game. Like, no matter how it is. And today I was like, I'm going to try everything possible to get out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"So from this morning, I was preparing myself that I will go out there. And, yeah, the medical staff was, like, unbelievable support for me and got me back out there somehow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"And, man, I'm super thankful for them. And, yeah, I gave everything I could. I gave everything I could. And, man, it feels great to be a champion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, we have like a super-composed team. We don't have any like, loud, like, guys. Like, we're super confident but also, like, down-to-earth people in this organization and in this roster."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Everybody had the mindset of, like, we are going to do whatever it takes, each of us individually, to get the job done. Like, we want to win a championship for this city."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"And everything, you know -- we did everything possible for that, and now we get the fruits from our labor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, finally, finally, man. It was a long road to get here, to be honest. To be the last team standing, it feels amazing. Like, all that work paid off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"As I said, when I was still on stage and stuff, like it still felt surreal. Like, I couldn't -- and us as a team, I think we couldn't really, like, settle into that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"But then once we got back to the locker room and started celebrating, I think that's when everybody realized we actually did it. We did it. And, yeah, Joe is an animal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I know, great question. Al is an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable person. Everybody loves him. He's a great leader. You know, knowing how he has been chasing this for so long in his career and finally get it done, and playing at a high, high level at his age, man, I don't even know, like, words I could use to describe him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know, everybody loves him. And he gave everything to this team. He deserves it more than anybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,No. Laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, obviously, like, what was put out, it was the truth. It was, like, something torn. And then my tendon is just out of place. And it, like, pretty much hurts on every step. Like, I would take a walk in Dallas, and my leg would swell up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I was like, I don't know how I'm going to play, if I'm going to play. But my mindset was always, I'm going to try to find a way how I can manage this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"And, yeah, somehow I got it going for this game. A lot of it was for sure like the adrenaline from just playing at the Garden and playing in front of our fans and having that opportunity to close it out. And, man, I got it going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Good question. I don't know how to answer it yet, to be honest. I think I'm going to need a little bit of time, and then I can kind of reflect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Because right now I'm just so in the moment and enjoying this. Man, this team, like, you know, it's just a special team and, like, everybody gave whatever they could for us to get here. And right now, we are just so in the moment. I think once I'm back home and settled, everything settles, I'll be able to compare better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's available. Expect to see him tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,Have faith and execute what's necessary to win Game 5.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it wasn't necessarily Game 4. It was the time after Game 3 leading up to our time together yesterday. So, I think it's just kind of getting the general temperature of the team. Kind of figuring out where we're at. And, you know, regardless of where we are at, the series, you always have small resets like that throughout anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,So thought that was just kind of the temperature of our team and making sure we are in the proper space to be ready to execute.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"It feels good. I think the most important thing, something that's really been going through my mind throughout this process, is you can't lose sight of the people that came before us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"And I want to make sure every person that's worked for the Celtics, that's played for the Celtics that didn't win, knows that their work and what they have done has not gone unnoticed or it doesn't play a part in where we are at today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"It can be so easy when you work for this organization and you don't win that the work that people put in just gets brushed over or gets ignored. And when I first got here, the staff, you know, Brad's coaching, the staff that they had, the foundation that they built with these guys when they were young, the foundation of what we have, is one of the reasons why we're here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think that's one of the first things that came to mind, was just because we won this doesn't mean what the people have done before us isn't just as important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yes. Payton is one of the best competitors and one of my favorite people in the world. Just the way he competes, the professionalism and just for his ability to take pride in stuff like that. He's really grown as a player this year to becoming a well-rounded player on both ends of the floor, and he won us games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think he won us moments. You know, as the playoffs go on, obviously some patterns change and things change, but those guys have to win moments of games for you, and Payton did that twice for us. That is just as important as any other plays that happened throughout the series and in the playoffs alone. You know, I've got a huge heart for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"It really starts with them. You can't have a philosophy or a way of playing if you don't have a group of guys that are willing to buy into it and be disciplined. Quite honestly, this group of guys has been through so much in the league, they know what it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's more about that. When you have a group of guys that have an understanding of what it takes, using the experiences that you've been through. And that, to me, is more than anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"It was a joy watching the guys just grow as a team throughout the year but also like really work at it. Like, there's a group of guys in the locker room that decided they wanted to win day one, and credit to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"That was awesome. It's a huge credit to him. Like I said, I know he's been in and out in the playoffs, but he's worked his ass off to try and get in and play as much as he could."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"It just says -- about the team, everyone is going to do whatever it takes to win. And even though he wasn't a hundred percent, he said he wanted to play, and he knew he could give us something. And I thought that the minutes he gave us were valuable. It speaks to who he is, and it speaks to the locker room."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, those were actual numbers. We live in an expected world. So we didn't pay much attention to the actual numbers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,But to me it was just paying attention more to the process of what we were doing. And there were obviously some things that we had to improve upon from last year analytically to make up for some of the stuff that we lost. The guys bought into that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"So to me, it was just more of the process of making sure that we are playing the right way, making sure, you know, we are attacking the game analytically in the right way, but also having the open-mindedness and discipline to do some of the other stuff."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought it was a good balance.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like it's going to be like that for the rest of my career, as it should be. I think just having an understanding that praise and criticism are both just as dangerous. And if you don't handle them well, and I think we talked about that as a team this year, like winning is just as dangerous as losing if you don't handle it well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think our guys handled winning the right way by, whether we won or lost, we just moved on to the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"And it's Boston. Like, we wouldn't want it any other way. I think the ownership and the responsibility to give back to the franchise, give back to the city, that's just part of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so I think -- but you need it. Like, you need that. You need criticism. You need praise. You need expectations. All those things go into making who you are as a person, making who you are as people, as an organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOE MAZZULLA,"So just having an understanding that they are never going to go away. If someone tells you ""Good job,"" that's just as dangerous as someone telling you you suck. But you need both of them in order to get to where you want to get to, and there's no place else I'd rather be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,They shoot the ball a lot. I mean they are good. They are really good. That number is incredible when you think about it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,But it works. And so we're going to need to add to that point total tonight if we want to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's a balance. You know, there's communication. There's always development with one's individual game. And so it's almost going to be a year since we had him in the draft. I think the draft is in nine or 10 days."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"And so to be able to see where he has improved, not just in his strength but also the other areas, and he can shoot. You know, he has the ability. He has a nice stroke out beyond the arc. And so in due time, he will be one that's going to probably shoot a lot of threes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"But right now, his strength is offensive rebounding, the vertical game, and then defense, being able to guard the ball and then also protect the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, those have been games that we've looked at as games that can change a series. And so just understanding swing games, when you look at 3 and 5, are typically the swing games. So we really have had success in Game 5s, and hopefully that will continue tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we expected him back at some point, and he's available tonight. What does it change? Just, you know, his ability to score in Game 1 and 2, and we have to be better. We've got to make him put it on the floor where he just can't catch-and-shoot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Then defensively, we have to be aware of his shot blocking. And so we've got to account for him when we do drive it to the paint that he's one that can change or block shots, and we have to be better at that. In Game 1 and 2, we weren't very good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"With him on the floor, we'll see how he moves, but I think that healthy or not healthy -- I mean, healthy, we are going to still check to see how he moves. So nothing changes there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we're going to fight. We put ourselves in a position in Game 4 to get a win to keep the series going, and now we're here in Boston. They have played extremely well at home. But we still feel that the pressure is on them to end the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"For us, it's to go out there and play. Hopefully we can copy some of the things we did in Game 4 to have success and hopefully can put ourselves in a position tonight to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"But, you know, as we've always said in this league, it's hard to close the door. Nothing's given. You've got to earn it. And so for tonight, we've got to find a way to keep this thing going and get it back to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"He's a superstar. He's one of the best players in the world. Most stars love that type of atmosphere, that type of setting. That's what makes them stars is they tend to bring their best game with their back against the wall. He's done it for the Mavs and for his national team, and so we expect nothing any less than that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I knew about the Red Sox and Yankees. You know, when you talk about being down 3-0, that's the truth and those are the facts."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"But there is another game to be played, and so if you can just stay in the present, that can help, you know, with what you're trying to achieve, and that's to keep the series going, and we did that in Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Here on the road, we have to be in the present. We can't think about Game 6 or Game 4. We have to play Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"So we are excited about having this opportunity, and hopefully we can put our best foot forward to keep this thing going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their journey for seven years, there's been ups, there's been learning experiences for them with winning and losing, and so understanding for us, we've been together for five months, some of us, so this is a really positive journey that we've been on here, and we'll look at what we can do as we get to the Finals, just understanding we have to play our best basketball. Unfortunately, Boston was better than us in this series and they won the championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the first step is just to be in it. I think that's a big thing. A lot of us -- when I say a lot of us, excluding the people in the locker room, didn't have us here, and so to be able to start the playoffs in L.A., to start the playoffs in Oklahoma, to start the playoffs in Minnesota, to understand that that's not easy to do. I thought the group did a great job. Yes, we lost 4-1, but I thought the group fought against the Celtics and just, unfortunately, we just couldn't make shots when we had to, or we turned the ball over and they took full advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"So there's a lot of positives in this run that we were on during the playoffs, but also, since March, we've been playing basketball at a high level. So when we go back to look at some of the stuff, what we can continue to build on and what we can get better at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a very good point. First year we lose to Golden State, who becomes the world champs, then we lose this year to the World Champs in the Boston Celtics. So, not a bad run in two out of three years. So, in between those two years, we get D-Live and we get trades that makes the team better, so a lot of positive things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"We're a young team, and so this isn't a team when you look at, you know, do we have to replace some of the older players, it's -- you know, we have a core, a young core at that, and so this is an exciting time to be a Mavs fan and to also be a coach for the Mavs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Well, he's one of the best players in the world, and so I think the biggest thing for him is that we all would like to be healthy, but there's going to be bumps and bruises along the way. So, for him at the age of 25 to get to the Finals, to be playing his basketball at the level that he's playing is, now it's just being consistent, and I think we all would say he led the league in scoring."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"He also has won, so now it's just a matter of being consistent and, again, always being in the talk for MVP because when you have one of the best players in the world, you should be always fighting for a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's just time, being able to go through it, to get to know each other a little bit better on the court and off the court. So, I think the more time that these guys are around each other the better they're going to be next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Again, five months without a training camp. This season started in Abu Dhabi and it's been going on for a long time. So for this group to spend time together, to fail, and to understand what it feels like to fail and also to see what failure is and then how do we get better and learn from that. I think I've got a great group of young men who will be hungry this summer and will come back ready to play at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it snowballed quickly. The turnovers led to easy baskets or wide-open threes. So they took advantage of that, and we couldn't keep scoring or keep pace with them. We got good looks that just didn't go down for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"Very confident. I mean, that's a positive note that we can take from this series, just how far we made it and how proud I am of the guys. We answered a lot of questions this year on what we were capable of doing and now it's just about being consistent. I think probably in the last week, I said that I wanted to be remembered as one of the best teams of this era and our last few champions have been a new one each and every year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"So, I see an opportunity for us to really build our future in a positive manner where this is almost like a regular thing for us, and we're competing for championships. You know, I think from a spiritual standpoint, I think I enjoyed this journey more than any other season, just because of the redemption arc and being able to learn as much as I did about myself and my teammates and the organization and the people that I'm around. It's a lot of good people here so it makes coming to work a lot of fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, it starts in the summertime, it starts early in preseason when you're developing your habits. I think we went 0-4 in preseason to start, which wasn't the best start. But we got off to a pretty decent start to the season and there was some injuries and some uncontrollable things that happened, but I think if you look at the overall big picture, Luka's right, and I've been saying it too, just failure, it can inspire you beyond measure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"We started off as a fifth seed and started on the road in every series and we were able to accomplish this and we were able to grow as teammates and a brotherhood here, a sisterhood here, where we can really take that as a positive going into the summer. So, yeah, failing at this stage definitely sucks. It's a bitter feeling because you want to keep playing and you feel like your best game is coming up next and the shots that you shoot next game are coming up, and now we got to wait two and a half months, three and a half months so the new champion gets a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"So, yeah, I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to grow with these guys in this locker room. Everybody across our organization, we've been able to celebrate our wins, but also learn how to celebrate our losses too and how to grow from that. So that's the difficult part of being human. When you really love something you really want to win and it doesn't happen, how do you respond from that. So I think that's where we are now, but I think I could tell you I'm pretty confident that we'll be back in the gym pretty soon and getting ready for next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it was emotional anyway. I mean, every series was emotional, just because I was just uncertain on how it was going to go and how we were going to respond to a little bit of adversity. We finally ran into a team where they beat us fair and square, and we weren't able to respond to a lot of their runs and we weren't able to execute at a high level. So when I was shaking everybody's hands, that was more of a sign of respect for their journey. They have been through an incredible five-year span of going to Game 7s or losing in the Finals, so they know what this bitter feeling feels like being up here answer answering questions about when this next year holds and I think they used everything as motivation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"They were healthy, and they really kept their head down and weren't paying attention to any of the personal accolades or individual accolades. I think they just came together as a team and were okay with each person being great in their role and selflessly putting their best foot forward. So I think we learned more than anything from this series on what it takes to not only get back to this level, but win at this level, and the Celtics are the perfect example for us this season because of how much they have had to deal with in the past few years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"So, it's admirable, you know, and to see -- did JB win Finals MVP? Yeah, that was big-time to see that trophy in his hands. I think him and JT should have split it, but those two guys in particular have, you know, almost been like students and as well now becoming teachers in their own right. So to see them accomplish -- see them accomplish that, I'm really proud and also extremely motivated to get back to this position in the next few years with my guys and be able to win this thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, basketball is a game of centimeters, man, sometimes inches, so when a ball is flying off your hands, sometimes it's going to feel good, sometimes it isn't. That's the maturity aspect. You got to move on to the next thing, and I've been talking about that. Whether I'm playing well specifically scoring-wise or I'm not, there is a team aspect here that we're becoming more gelled into or dialed into."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"I can score 25 points, but if I don't, we got to be able to pick each other up, and I think that's what we're learning about each other now, where they're going to be games where the shooting is not going to go well particularly for me or someone else on the team, and that's where we have to galvanize as a group and other players make plays and opportunities created for one another. I've been at the point of attack through most of my drives going against the Celtics one-on-one or coming off screens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"So that's what the summer is for, is just continuing to work on those things that I saw this year, the physicality, being able to adjust to it and by next year be in a better position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would agree with that. Yeah, just time together means a lot, and failing together is not the ideal situation, but from a leadership standpoint, going through situations like that sometimes it will motivate you beyond things that you could imagine. When I was a little bit younger and I was injured in 2015 and we lost, it was a team loss. It wasn't just I was injured and we could have done this or that. So that went on my Finals record. I was 0-1. The next year we came back and won in a 3-1 comeback, and then the following year we lost against the Warriors and I haven't been back since."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"So, I look at it as, you know, an opportunity for us to observe what we did well this year as a group and how me and Luka can be better as the leaders of the team, one of -- a few of the leaders on the team, and really just enjoy the ups and downs of what's coming because now we know what to expect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"So, this past year was a lot of newness. It was a lot of people being in new positions in terms of just the success. Success can be new for a lot of people too, but when you fail at the Finals, it's not something that you want to carry the disappointment forever or on to next season. We worked extremely hard to be one of the final two teams. We didn't achieve our goal, but we achieved most of our goal. So, this is just the last step that we have to get back to, and we know it's not going to be easy. We're going to be going against a lot of young teams that are emerging, but we're going to get better as well, and I think this experience will carry us forth in the following series that we play next year. God willing we make it back to the playoffs and get the chance to play our best basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it's easy to get to that point when you have no other choice but to look at your partner or your teammates and say that we're going to do this and we're going to accomplish it, no matter what anyone says."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,KYRIE IRVING,"The hardest thing, I would say one of the most difficult things, not the hardest thing, but one of the most difficult things in this industry is, as I've been here for 12 years, is dealing with a lot of the relationship with, sort of say, social media or fans and media, and then us as players and wanting to achieve a golden legacy, so to say. Everybody looks at MJ as the prototypical guy, he was 6-0. Then you go down the list to Bill Russell and other great guys that have come through this league -- I could name a myriad of names, but for those guys in particular I think they have had the same trajectory or career path as some of the greatest to play the game, where they have lost early in their career and now they're at the top of the mountain because they earned their way there and they have been able to learn. So, again, I'm nothing short of proud of those guys, but I think this was a message to my teammates as well, that when we get this opportunity, God willing we get this opportunity again, we work hard, it's going to be more than just our talent that's going to get us over that edge. It's going to be more than just somebody scoring 30. It's going to take more than just scoring, it's going to take everything from you. That's what makes this thing beautiful too is, when you get to the top of that mountain, how do you stay motivated there. Now that they're there I think those are questions they're going to have to answer for themselves. But for us, we got to the top of the mountain and we failed, so now we have to start at the bottom, and that should be inspiring. So, grateful that I love what I do, grateful that I get to do it with people that love what they do too. So it will be a long summer, but looking forward to the start of next season now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"I'm so grateful. I know I've said it before, but it's glory to the Lord for putting me in this position. It's been a lot of years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"Wow. It was crazy because during free agency meetings in 2016, my agent and I, Jason Glushon, were both sitting in the meeting, and we just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wycs hand. And after the meeting we were like, Did you notice that? That's the attention."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"Man, I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, ""You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"The fact that it has come, it has happened, JT, JB, stepping up in a big way and leading us, it's special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, no question. You know, we all know Joe was thrown into the fire last year, and I felt like he did the best he could."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"But I just think this year, everything was different when we came in for workouts before training camp. He really, I felt like, put a sprint on everything how he wanted it to be and how he wanted us to work, how he wanted us to carry ourselves and how determined he wanted us to be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"And it started from there. That energy that he had translated to the assistant coaches, to us, to the training staff, everybody, and we just kind of follow suit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"I feel like this type of team is Joe Mazzulla ball. It's defending, being gritty on offense. It's being able to -- everybody be a threat on the court at the same time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"And everything that he wanted to do, he was able to accomplish. He always knew when to push the buttons. He's hard. He can be a little whacky sometimes. But that's what we appreciate about him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"He truly cares about us, and he cares about what it means to be a Celtic."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, the first thing you have to do when you come here is you have to embrace that pressure. And I was okay with being in that position. I was okay if we were getting criticized and we weren't getting it done because I understood what it means playing here. And to your point, finally overcoming that and winning and putting ourselves with the greats, this is special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"Our group, we've had a lot of hardships the last few years. Last year, heartbreaker against Miami, Game 7. Year before, Golden State. It's been building up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"But this team has been resilient, and we've continued to work. I'm so proud of Jaylen, and I'm so proud of Jayson. Those two guys continue to take steps forward. People all year criticizing them, all that expectation, all the pressure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,They did it. And they've done it at a young age. They led our group. I'm just very proud of those guys and to put everything aside and focus on winning.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"Man, that was beautiful. That was beautiful. He did that, and you take a glance at the other team, and it's one of those that breaks your spirit, and then it just kind of fueled us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"But Payton, man, that just sums it up. It was ups and downs for him, not knowing what to expect, when to play, when not to play. He's the kind of guy that he is a big-time player, and it's hard because we have a lot of guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"But man, him stepping up, cold, ready, not afraid of the moment, taking the shot and man, as soon as he shot it, like I don't know how you guys saw it, but I was like, man, he's about to knock it down. Like this is crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,AL HORFORD,"So, man, the fact that he knocked it down, like that was huge. That was special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I feel like it was impressive. I feel like what people expected us to do or doubted us to do, we did. So shout out to this team and this organization. We did it together, and that was the only way that we could do it was together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, that we did it together. I hope that when people watch us play, they see the joy that we play with, that we love playing together, and we got it done together. I feel like that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. It doesn't. Winning's always great. When you do it with people that you love to do it with, it feels great. When you see your teammates celebrating and jumping on each other and throwing champagne, there's nothing like it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's been a journey, you know. I think just being able to, I don't know, maybe reflect on it right now, it's crazy. It seemed like it was yesterday, sitting there with Wyc and him introducing me and just kind of handing me the jersey and everything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"And then fast-forward to now, it's like insane. But I'm blessed to be here, and I'm so happy to be here and I'm so happy Brad gave me that call to come through, and JT texting me, hitting me up, talking about ""Come on, Champ."" It's been a hell of a journey."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I think I've spoken on this plenty of times, but they get scrutinized so much and they get so much pressure put on them for not winning or making it to the Eastern Conference Finals eight years in a row, or even making it to the Finals and not getting over that hump."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But I feel like people finally see the relationship that they have. They see that from the beginning, they have always done it together. They have never compared against each other. They have always been joyful and happy for each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"So it's been great to experience on this side, and to be on this side and get this win, hopefully it's a burden off of their shoulders. But another burden is doing it again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"He's done a great job. He's definitely elevated my game. Had me look kind of outside of myself and bring something different, you know."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"On previous teams where maybe I had to score more or handle the ball more, here it was more about being available and knocking down corner threes and rebounding. Doing things that help this team because of the talent that we have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You know, he really opened my eyes to that and from the beginning really just made it known that whatever it takes, as long as it takes, we've got to get it done, and I'm not the only one on this team sacrificing. Everybody on this team sacrificed something."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they just -- they came out aggressive, man. They were good defensively. They're a great defensive team. Respect to them and respect to the coaches for their defensive scheme."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, it's been a hell of a year. I love these guys, man. Like, I mean, we put this team -- you know, with trades and everything was five months ago and to see the growth as a team, and it's different. You know, like -- I don't know. There's a lot of international guys and we don't always have family around and to be able to build a bond like this and to call the team family, it's awesome. To be able to do that in such a short amount of time is -- it's amazing. So obviously, we didn't get what we wanted, but I'm proud and everyone else is very proud of the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, it's fun when everything -- yeah. 1 through 15, man, like I couldn't -- like, best teammates. They're all great guys in all their individual ways. So, I mean, yeah, by far, man, it always makes your job a lot better when you have fun every day and to call those guys my teammates, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"We got here and I think everyone's hungry now. Obviously, we didn't get where we wanted to, but it's not the end of the world. We know that we need to regroup and be back here again next year. That's the goal every single year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, Kyrie does a great job and he's done a great job from the moment he's got here of being a leader and being someone for younger guys, but also for everyone on the team. So, I mean, obviously it is what it is. The crowds can chant whatever they want to chant. When we're away, they're obviously going to go against us. He does a great job of not letting it affect him and I think that goes back to his leadership on and off the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"So we have nothing but respect for Kyrie and we're not expecting the Celtics to be with us. We're opposing them. So whatever they say is whatever they say. But we all got his back, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"Just maybe just physicality, coming out a little stronger or whatnot. But, I don't know, I really haven't thought about it too much. I don't know. My head's all over the place right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I don't know. I just wanted to leave it all on the floor tonight. I try to play every game like it's my last. But, I mean, individual, like it doesn't really matter at this stage. I really just want to win. Yeah, I don't know. We just didn't win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,Nothing. Sad we lost. No specific.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,"It doesn't matter if I was hurt, how much was I hurt. I was out there. I tried to play, but I didn't do enough."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,"I feel great. We did some great moves. I would say we've been together for five months. I'm proud of every guy that stepped on the floor, all the coaches, all the people behind. Obviously, we didn't win Finals, but we did have a hell of a season and I'm proud of every one of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,They were physical a lot. They have great defenders.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,Just everything. They're a great team. That's what they do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't want to talk about what's next, man. I have some decisions to make. I'm just trying to get a little bit healthier. We'll talk -- we have interviews in two days, right? So I'll give you an answer then."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,"Right now, I don't really know. That's not what I'm thinking. But they're a great team. They have been together for a long time, and they had to go through everything, so we just got to look at them, see how they play, maturity, and they have some great players. We can learn from that. We got to fight next season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,LUKA DONCIC,"Just stay together, man. I think just having Ky on my team -- I mean, on our team, he's unbelievable. Just help him. We said, We'll fight together next season, and we just going to believe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"To be honest, I can't even put it into words. Just Bill Russell and what he's meant for me through my Boston journey, and his spirit. You know, everything that he stood for, just for this to be the Bill Russell MVP Award, it just -- I've got nothing, man. I don't even know what to say. It's unreal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we learned. I think we learned from all of our mistakes. All of our adversity has made us stronger, made us tougher. All season you could see it. We started from the jump. We made all the sacrifices. We played both ends of the ball at a high level. We didn't skip any steps. And this was the result."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"And it makes it feel even that much better that we had to go through all the journey, the heartbreak, the embarrassment, the loss, to get to the mountaintop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,It's great. And shout out to all the supporters and the city of Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't even put into words the emotions. It's just I'm blessed and I'm grateful. This was a full team effort. We had a great team. My teammates were great. They allowed me to lead us on both ends of ball, and we just came out and performed on our home floor. It's just amazing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"You know, it could have gone to anybody. It could have gone to Jayson. Jayson, like I can't talk enough about his selflessness. You know, I can't talk enough about his attitude. It's just how he approached not just this series or the Finals but just the playoffs in general. And we did it together as a team, and that was the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just our growth together. We've been through a lot. We've been playing together for seven years now. We've been through a lot, the losses, the expectations. The media have said all different types of things We can't play together, we are never going to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"We heard it all. But we just blocked it out, and we just kept going. I trusted him. He trusted me. And we did it together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"To get to this point and share that experience with JT is just awesome, you know what I mean? It's amazing, and it feels great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"If you would have asked me that maybe a year ago, I would probably say yeah. But just at the point I got to right now, it feels great. But any of the personal awards, it is what it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, the doubters, they may be quiet now, but they will be back. They will be back next year with something to say. I'll embrace that moment the same and get after it yet again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,Golden Bears.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't. I can't. I absolutely can't, man. Just the story and the journey is awesome. You know, just being drafted here in Boston, like a lot of the people probably didn't watch me play in the Pac-12 at Cal. You know, it led to a lot of people feeling a way about that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"And, you know, I just came in and kept my head down and told myself, I'm going to just keep working. And, you know, to be here in this moment now, through all the years, through all the doubt, through all of the ups and downs, through all of the verdicts, through all of the everything, it just makes the story that much sweeter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But I can't even put it into words. Like, it just feels great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, nobody deserved it more than Al. He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"Like just his performance all season long, like Al is 37, 38 years old, and we leaned on him so much. Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains, you know what I mean. The only thing he does is add to winning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"For him, great teammate. It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we have an opportunity. I think we definitely have a window. We take it one day at a time. We definitely have to make sure we stay healthy. But, you know, we'll enjoy the summer, enjoy the moment, and then we get right back to it next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, it still kind of feels unreal. It feels like there's another game or something tomorrow. But, you know, I can't tell you enough about our group and our coaching staff. They were great all season long. They prepared us for these moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"We had an excellent game plan in the Finals, and then all of the guys contributed. Like, for example, like Payton Pritchard, like unreal, right. Unreal. Like just comes in the game and drains one from halfcourt. That dude, he's a f---ing legend, man. Shout out to Payton Pritchard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"It means a lot. I wish my grandmother was here with me to see this moment. But I woke up from my pregame nap, and I had a dream, and my grandma was in the dream, and she gave me a hug this afternoon. I just knew everything was going to be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,But I wish she could be here. But she was so important and pivotal in my life. And it's just awesome. I know she would be proud of me.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"Grandma, I know she was watching, and I love you so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,Dianne Varnado.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,"I don't know about celebrate, but it's been a nice, relaxing day. Spent some time with the kids. My dad is in town and spent time with him. Just try and enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,"Try to move on. I mean, that's what the playoffs is all about, win or loss, you've got to move on from it. You've got to learn from it. You understand that you've got to play better than obviously Game 4. Every game gets more difficult, so we just have to be locked into our game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,"We've been lucky enough to have a lot of the past champions here, and just seeing their presence. I just think that when it gets tough, and obviously it's going to get tough. We've just got to stick together. We've got to believe in one another, and we've been doing that all year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,"For us? I would say we're a confident group. I just think you've got to stick together. There's going to be ups, and there's going to be downs. And, I mean, if someone is struggling or whatever, you have to pick them up, and that's the type of team we have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,"Obviously you just look at the rebounding numbers, that tells you a lot about what happened in that game. Just get back to five guys crashing the paint and just trying to get every rebound."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't look at it as pressure. I do notice, especially this time of the season, playoff time and obviously being in the Finals for the second time. When you drive around and go to the gas station, or I wanted to go get some ice cream yesterday, it's Celtics gear everywhere and everybody is super excited about this team and what we have accomplished and what we have the chance to accomplish."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"You really just feel the love and support from everybody in the city of Boston, and how bad they want us to win, how much they have been cheering for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"So I don't look at it as pressure. Just unconditional support, and that we have an amazing fan base here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It did take some time. For one, normally, when you're a top five draft pick, you go to a lottery team that is rebuilding. I was in a unique situation from the rest of the guys in my draft class in that the Celtics were the No. 1 seed in the East before. We were competing for a championship ever since I've gotten here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"I would say just throughout that season. I had no idea who Cedric Maxwell was. I thought he was just like a radio guy laughter. I didn't know that he played on the team, and he won Finals MVP."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,So there were just different instances throughout the season in my rookie year where I would learn about different people that played an intricate part in this organization -- the history throughout the Celtics and what the Celtics mean to the game of basketball. You just grow a level of appreciation through your time here.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. When I found out that I was going to be a dad, I was still in college. I had like a week or two left. I wasn't ecstatic. I was a little selfish at that point because I knew that I was about to go chase my dream and be in the NBA. I felt like that was going to affect what people thought of me, affect where I went in the draft."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"So I'd be the first to say I wasn't like super thrilled to find out I was going to be a dad, and quickly realized that it was like the best thing that ever could have happened to me. There's nothing better than being a dad."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"I think, especially for me and my first year in the NBA at 19, it taught me a sense of responsibility. Because it's tough, being 19 years old and coming into fame and this newfound fortune. Nobody can, I guess, help you or prepare you for what it's like to be 19 and have millions of dollars."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"And I think -- not that I think. I know that having Deuce at that age grounded me. Because whatever decision I wanted to make, I had to make sure that he was taken care of. I couldn't just up and go or do everything that some of my peers were doing because I had to go home and put him to bed. Or for Father's Day weekend I was going out of town or -- I had to skip out on this trip with my friends because it was my weekend with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"Not that it's a sacrifice. I willingly would choose those things. But it has taught me a sense of responsibility, as well as just making the right decisions. Knowing that there's a six-year-old mini me essentially watching everything that I do and knowing that I have to be the best version of myself. I have to make the right decisions because he's always watching."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think after Game 4, he just reminded us to have fun. We wanted to go for the kill, essentially, and we wanted to win so bad that maybe we got away from what makes us special and what makes us the Boston Celtics."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"Today, just reminded each guy why he's important to this team and why we all need each other and what a person brings to the table. I think that was really important for us to go over today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,I don't think we came out and expected that we were going to come out and roll over on it and win. I firmly believe we had the right intentions. We wanted to win. We wanted to play the right way. That moment -- we wanted that moment.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,But I think we maybe put too much pressure on ourselves at that moment to be perfect or think it was going to go how we wanted it to go.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,Joe did a great job today of reminding us that it's okay to smile during wars. It's okay to have fun during high-pressure moments. That's what makes our team unique and special.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"We would love to win tomorrow, more than anything. But if it doesn't happen, it's not the end of the world. We have more opportunities. So just setting that table of don't surrender to that idea that we have to win tomorrow. We would love to, absolutely. But Game 5 is the biggest game of the season because it's the next game on the schedule."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"So going with that mindset, and just have fun. That's really what we talked about today. Get back to having fun and being a team and how special we are and the team that got us here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Very excited. We're excited to come out here and compete and try to get this W.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"We came back Saturday morning. It was a nice flight. We already moved on from it. There's no reason to dwell on it. Get ready for Game 5 and try to get the W. The flight was good. We got together as a team, enjoyed it and get ready."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It would be huge to win this next game. We really want to win the next game. But if we don't, it's not the end of the world. We have three more rounds to go, at most. But the most important game is the next one, and to do it in front of the home crowd would be special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I'm expecting it to be rowdy. Definitely a crazy, crazy atmosphere. Looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just shows that teams are capable of coming back from that. If you get hot, you can win four games in a row. So understanding that, and knowing that every game we've got to bring everything we've got. It's going to take 48 minutes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player. He's somebody we care for deeply and gives us a great boost. Him as a person, just being there is huge for us. We are lucky to have him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He definitely wants to play. He's a really big competitor, and I know he's going to do everything in his power to get out there and put on that uniform with his teammates."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They just beat us in every category possible 5050 balls, rebounding, shooting, defensively. It's like one of those games, you just scrap and look forward to the next one because they beat us fair and square."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"That will never happen if you don't run back on defense, rebound, execute and get to your spacing. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,I haven't talked to him yet. Going to talk about that before we start at 200. So I'm not sure kind of where he's at. But he's trying and doing everything he can to try to put himself in position to be out there. I know that for sure.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"You're just made by all the experiences and things that you have. Regardless of what I am, what I'm made from, first and foremost, my identity, Christ is the most important thing before all that. And after that, it's about winning for the Boston Celtics and the process of winning -- getting back on defense, playing hard, transition, rebounding, spacing, execution. Those things are the most important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's a good question. Multiple layers to that. Obviously it's game plan, execution, and that can change once the game begins. One side of the ball is heavily dictated by the other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think one of the things that we've freed our minds to this year is just making reads and having an understanding, having a spatial awareness about who is where, what's the spacing, what's the attack and just being able to make plays on both ends of the floor there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"So there's definitely obviously a game plan component. You have to have a plan going into it. But at the end of the day, it's the individual pride, and then it's the instincts from the guy when they are out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, every game, regardless of how it goes, there's always stuff that you can learn from and there's always stuff that you don't learn from. Regardless, I think the most important thing is our process toward getting better has been the same whether we have won or lost, whether we have won big or lost big."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"We have always tried to find the 10 or 12 possessions we can get better at and find the things we did pretty well and how can we do those more. I just kept a consistent process toward our postgame retrieval, and then how we grow with that heading into the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"When they are at their best, the team that dictates the pace dictates kind of the momentum and the opportunities. So yeah, I think that's definitely part of it, is how can we dictate the pace of the game and how can we dictate the momentum of the game. You can do that in different ways. Transition is obviously one of those, but there's other ways you can do that as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,Just have to be open-minded. Every game takes on a life of its own. We have the things that we can control and then we have the things that we have to be ready to adjust to kind of depending upon how the game goes over the course of time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just a guy defined by the ability to make plays on both ends. Like you said, mistakes don't weigh him down. Doesn't matter if he misses a shot or makes a mistake on the defensive end. Just has the ability to make plays and he can do them on both ends of the floor. That balance of impacting the game in different ways is crucial for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,Thank you.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, definitely. I think some of our defensive struggles came from our offensive struggles, no question, and vice versa. There's definitely some things we need to do better on the offensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"We just take it as -- being together, in film and just understanding the flow of the game. But even before the game, Coach Kidd said, I hope you packed your bags because we are going to Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just having that mentality of doing whatever it takes. We've definitely been changing our ID from playing free to playing desperate. Doing whatever we can to get a bucket or get a stop. That energy, that focus is going to propel us into transition buckets, transition steals and trying to get into the game that we play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"We definitely need to help them. They have a lot of weight on their shoulders. They're controlling the ball the majority of the time. They have the majority of the points. No matter if it's the offensive or defense side, we're backing them up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"They can have their foot on the gas as much as possible knowing that if they have to take their foot off the gas a little bit, we're going to pick it back up. There are going to be times when they get tired or they're not going to bring the ball up the floor. That's where we are their backup as role players, as people on the bench doing what we need to do to take a little weight off their back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"We were playing like how we play. We were running and talking and playing free. We were just trusting one another. We were getting back into the mentality of trusting the pass, trusting the next pass and, on the defensive side, just trusting the person behind you, trusting the person who is talking."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"Definitely can. We're not going to say that Game 4 was our best game. Game 4 was a good game, but we're not hanging our hats on it. We adjusted, and now it's just taking what we did in Game 4 and adding a little bit more aggression into Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,I wouldn't say it's a new series. Everyone just counted us out after the first three.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,We are not going to count ourselves out. We are going to double down and put ten toes down and make sure that we are giving it our all on the court. Put our heart and soul on the floor and do whatever it takes to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's going to be loud and nasty. You do your best not to focus on the crowd. There's going to be a lot of people talking to you. Social media, walking down the street, you're in the hotel room, you're in the hotel, you're going to hear people talking to you, you're going to hear people talking to you coming to the arena. It's part of the game. Part of the job. You have to deal with adversity and people always telling you you can't, and you've got to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"That specifically wasn't the conversations, but the vibe was always good because we won, right. I think we also showed that that's how we've got to play and how we should play the game. That was more so the reason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"As a team, when you play professional sports, you never quit. You always fight. You always play. You always compete, and I think we showed that the last game. We had that energy, like a little bit desperation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,We have to treat every game like that. There's no relaxing. We've got to play our best because obviously we're playing against the best. But we are going to stay together and compete until the last game. So that has to be the mindset no matter what.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"There's always been history in sports, in different sports. So I think as an athlete, you should always believe and always keep fighting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"Well, we have our schemes and we have a certain way that we play. I think it's more so understanding what we want to be and how we want to create certain mismatches and certain drive-and-shot opportunities. It's not so much changing our playing style right now. We've got to keep playing the basketball that we played all season long that got us here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"We've just got to make sure that we create the spot and the spacing for Kyrie and Luka. The first three games, we didn't do it as much. So they had to take all the shots and they had to settle for different shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"Game 4, we played with a different pace. We got it up quick. That creates mismatches and better opportunities for us, and also creates an open floor, for example, and Derrick Jones, attacking and stuff like that. It's more about finding the right spacing, but there's no time to change our style right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"Whatever it takes. That's the mindset, it's not going to be perfect, especially against a team like that. There had to be adjustments obviously because they play different than other teams. But I think we have great guys, smart guys, high-IQ guys that can adapt to changes, that's what we showed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"Last game, overall, still the energy was the key factor. And one of the guys who got us going early, for example, Dereck Lively, just like having that energy and alertness helps us to be on the same page, communicate better and have the right rotations down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,MAXI KLEBER,"And that's what we've got to keep doing. Challenge every shot, they are a great shooting team, so you can't have moments where you mess up multiple offensive or defensive plays because they are just going to go on a run. For us, the energy kept us being alert and helped us adjust to the defensive rotations, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought they were really good in Game 4. That helped us get to Game 5. But just understand, we can't have three on the ball. They are too good at being able to make that pass. They are the best team at shooting the three. There are some things that we can clean up, and we're going to have to be better here in Game 5 if we want to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"I think what helps is we were in that situation last game. So not to change or deviate from what we talked about in Game 4. It's just take each possession one possession at a time, and hopefully we can put ourselves up winning each quarter. We ended up doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"Same thing that we are talking about today and tomorrow is we can only focus on Game 5, and trying to find a way to win here in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, one, it's hard to win in the Finals. And so I think, as you brought up, each game, we have gotten better on both ends, offensively and defensively. So the trend is to continue to get better. Hopefully we can do that in Game 5, where we can get better defensively and offensively. We started to knock down shots here in Game 4, and hopefully we can get those same shots in Game 5 and have the opportunity to knock them down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"But looking at Luka and Ky, those two have to set the tone for us and everybody else will follow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"I think, and I'm not speaking for him, but just from experience, just as an athlete, you want to get another opportunity, and he has that opportunity here tomorrow night. Hopefully he can take full advantage of that. Make some adjustments and look back at Game 1 and 2 and see what they were doing to him defensively and hopefully take advantage in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"Our defense didn't really change. I think just the effort. I think Luka participated at a high level, and he was really good on the ball. He came up with some deflections and steals. We believe that he is going to be involved in the pick-and-roll tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"We're going to need that same effort from him, but also for the guys that are there to help protect him, they will be ready to protect him. But he's got to participate at a high level, and we believe he will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he looked like he joined a special company. He looked like Ray and Steph. So we're going to need that here in Game 5. If it's a close game, hopefully he is able to knock down those same shots, get those same shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"But it was great to see Timmy knock down those shots. Hopefully he can build on that, and as a team we can build on that. We are going to need that here in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,They are not a team that changes. They are a team that makes you change.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"So they are going to probably look to see that they had some good looks from three that didn't go down, and also being able to probably get Tatum and Brown going early. Having those two attack our defense early is probably something that could be an adjustment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"But for them, it's shooting the three, creating in the three and then capitalizing on your mistakes. Hopefully for us, our mistakes were low in Game 4, and hopefully they are low in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's probably something to that. If we look at the analytics of our group, they are young, and as the series goes on, they get better. Hopefully that's true tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JASON KIDD,"Sometimes when you do play an opponent over and over, you get used to the tendencies and you start to capitalize on that on both ends, defensively and offensively. Hopefully our group has seen enough of Boston to understand what they are good at, and hopefully we can take that away tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I don't want you to mistake us smiling and joking around with each other and being in practice, you know, for a weakness or that we are not taking this any more serious than we were in Game 4. I just think we are here in Boston and just trying to settle ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"We had a meeting, just as a squad, at the hotel, where we went over film. So we were pretty locked in from there, and there was carryover into our early minutes in practice. And then when you guys come in, pretty much having fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"It's been this way since we were kids. We want to make sure we relish in this moment, don't take it for granted and just ground ourselves here, too. I think the last two games, we were even more intense when we were here in Boston. Don't think we got as settled as we would have liked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"So we just wanted to try some things a little different, a little bit more smiling. And then 24 hours from now, getting ready for all-out battle against this great Celtics team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"Well, to answer your first part of your question, I would be being dishonest if I just took the time to say thank you for putting those words together in terms of my interactions with people being majority of the time positive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I'll be honest with you, it's not always positive all the time. I'm human. Sometimes there's some misunderstanding or miscommunications and it takes a little bit of a longer, thorough conversations just to get on the same page. I think I've just figured out in my life, a lot of people just want the time and space to be heard. They want to be listened to. And then if they respect you and you respect them, then they'll listen to you and give you the space to say how you feel as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I've talked about it over the past few months, just where I was in 2017 or '18, when I first got traded here to Boston. I wasn't in the place to be able to vocalize my feelings or know how to do that. I was learning how to be a man. Learning how to be a father. So part of that evolution came from that, taking the time to go inside and figure out who I wanted to become."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"But also, I had to accept some of the things, some of the choices I had done in my life. When you look at yourself in the mirror, sometimes you don't like what you see, and that could lead to some depression or lead to some anxiety or lead to other mental health issues."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"That's a big thing that I think our generation is spearheading, where I hope that the older generation can take a lesson out of our book, that this isn't just some spiritual '70s type of mantras we are trying to put out here. We actually believe in what we talk about in terms of meditation and having the ability to slow your life down and making sure that you keep your priorities straight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,Because the world is not going to care about how you feel mentally all the time or whether or not you are healthy when you are at home or taking care of yourself. So you have to figure out that space for yourself and figure out the village and the tribe that you want to have around you that supports those goals that you have personally.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't want to get too preachy, preachy. I could speak for hours. But, yeah, that's been the growth since 2017. Even before then. Just learning how to be a person in this world, making an impact in a positive way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"When I look back, getting traded here, it wasn't one of my options. It wasn't like No. 1 on my list. So when the trade opportunity got approached to me, instead of going back and appreciating the Celtics' history, I just came in with an open mind and just kind of like, all right, I'm just going to go with the flow into this. But I think that was the wrong approach. Just being young."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"Now being older with hindsight looking back, I definitely would have taken time to know the people in the community and talked to some of the champions that have come before me and actually extend myself to them instead of the other way around, expecting them to be there giving me advice. Because they have been through this. They have championship pedigree here. They have shown it for years. They are one of the most winningest franchises in all of sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"So you have to show your respect here. I think that's what I struggled with initially, was figuring out how I'm going to be a great player here while winning championships and also leading a team and selflessly joining the Celtics' organization or the cult that they have here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what they expect you to do as a player. They expect you to seamlessly buy into the Celtics' pride, buy into everything Celtics. And if you don't, then you'll be outed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm one of the people that's on the outs laughing. I'm perfectly fine with that, you know what I mean. I did it to myself. They don't welcome me with a warm embrace, even though I know a lot of people in the organization and I'm friends still with some of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"But, yeah, doing it to myself. And that's what I was talking about in terms of accepting the choices. But looking back, I would have shown my respect and have more of a council around me from some of the Boston Celtics that came before me to explain what the pressure is like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"You just expect to have a magnifying glass on you everywhere you go. I don't think Boston appreciates being kind of second class to New York in terms of the media capital of the world, but this is the media capital of the world as well. There's a lot of history here off the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"The community has integrated into the Celtics' team. That's probably the best way I could say it. The community is what makes the Celtics great here, the Boston pandemonium. That's what makes this space so loud and so special, and they take pride in it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"If any player is coming here, getting drafted here, thinking about coming here for free agency, getting traded here, I just think do your homework and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. That's something I could offer."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"He was just playing with a liberation within his game and came out knocking shots. That's what we need from him, is just to stay confident, stay fluid. He's been going a great job with the young guys on the bench as well, keeping them engaged."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I think that's the next part of his evolution, including all of ours, is just continue to be a better teammate, regardless if you're shooting the ball or not. I think that helps reward you when you're doing those things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, we just have to wait and see tomorrow, man. You know, change a few things up. Be prepared for what I'm getting myself into. My teammates, most importantly, and not making this about me or getting into the energy with anyone else other than my teammates. That's about it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, let's just call it what it is. When the fans are cheering, ""Kyrie sucks,"" they feel like they have a psychological edge, and that's fair. Of course, if I'm not making shots or turning the ball over, that makes it even more of a pressing issue that they can stay on me for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I think in order to silence even the self-doubt, let alone the crowd doubt, but the self-doubt when you make or miss shots, that's just as important as making sure I'm leading the team the right way and being human through this experience, too, and telling them how I feel."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I've had a few teammates be in this building with me for wins and losses, so I know what it feels like for both. I try to pay attention to the positive things that got us wins here earlier in my career, but also thinking about things that I can learn from in performances that I've had here where I didn't play up to par. It's just being honest about it and just breathing through the experience and having fun with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, by just thinking about the goal that we have in front of us as best we can, and try not to get tired of everyone talking about the history that has not been made."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"I've said it over the past 48 hours, just putting our best foot forward and just simplifying. It's basketball. Win, lose or draw, or win or lose, that's all that can happen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,KYRIE IRVING,"Just want to be as prepared as we can for whatever the environment is going to be like in terms of what's expected from you. But what I'm sharing with my teammates now is just enjoy the moment. We got a chance to accomplish one of our goals, which is to make it back to Boston. We have another goal in front of us, and that's to make it back to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,AL HORFORD,"No, I left home pretty early. My kids, they made the trip to Dallas. They were still sleeping when I left. So I think they felt the trip and everything. When I get home today, I'll get to spend time with them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we acknowledge that they got the best of us. Just trying to quickly shift our focus to this opportunity that we have here, Game 5 here at home. Yeah, we're looking for a good practice today, a good session to get back on track for tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,AL HORFORD,"It's going to be special. It's going to be special tomorrow. It's going to be electric. The fans, they've wanted to be a part of an opportunity and game of this magnitude with a chance that we have in front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,AL HORFORD,"So I know it's going to be electric here from before the game. I've been in these types of games, like where they are big games like that. The fans here, they are all into it. So I don't expect anything less."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,AL HORFORD,"People are going to use different things, and whatever you need to do, that's what will happen. For us, it's understanding the opportunity we have in front of us and making sure to take advantage of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. I think we understand that they are a desperate team and they are playing probably a little freer. We know what that mindset is like. For us, it's really controlling what we can control and making sure that we are solid in the things that we need to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think they were just a tougher team. I think they locked into tendencies and played defense as a team and played very well.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think deep down, however long it takes, whatever it takes. No matter where it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nobody likes to get beat like that at any point in anybody's career in the season. But in the Finals, it also doesn't feel good. So really just want to get back out there and play again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I was actually the first one up today, which is weird. I'm usually sleeping in. But it was cool just to have the kids. Got breakfast and really just enjoyed seeing them. I mean, being lovey and playing around. It's been a great morning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know, a little bit of both. I think that they adjusted and they played very, very hard and very desperate. We have to do the same thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Working on Father's Day kind of sucks. You would think as fathers, we would get the whole day off. But I guess you guys want to talk to us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Father's Day is cool. I think this is maybe the second time that I've been in this type of situation, either on my birthday or Father's Day, where I'm still working. I'm not too mad at it, but I would like the day off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's huge. Made it all the way back to Game 7. Knowing that feeling and remembering that feeling and using that feeling to boost our play and intensity is something that I obviously rely on them for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. Again, I think a loss is a loss. It doesn't matter how it was lost or by how many points. I'm a competitor and I think we're competitors, and we want to win every game. You just have to take it on the chin, just like we did, and come back and try to prepare for Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"We are excited to get back on the court and put our best foot forward in Game 5. After a loss like that, you always feel like there's extra motivation to get back on the court and get going again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"We haven't watched anything yet, but I'm sure we'll watch a little bit, at least, see what went wrong, what we can learn from it and how we can get better from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"I wouldn't say it changes from win to loss. It's pretty similar every game, to be honest with you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"I would say it's similar. I mean, you're never perfect in a win or a loss, so I feel like there's always room to grow and improve. And I think he does a good job of that, just keeping us grounded, even after we were on a 10-game winning streak before this in the playoffs, which is pretty rare."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"But also highlighting that that that's a pretty successful accomplishment, but coming off a loss like that, theres a lot to learn."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"I think Jayson said it the other night. We expect it to be as loud as it has been all season, and we are excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"You crave that as an athlete, as a player. You dream of it, and, you know, to be a part of it is pretty special as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"You know, it's a weird balance almost. It's hard to, like, take moral victories from that, but also in the same breath, you know, it's nice to see some go through on the offensive end and things like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"But it's kind of a weird, fine line of pulling some good things from it but also understanding that we lost by 40."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"To be honest, like some of my best games I've had as a player are my worst-shooting performances in pregame shooting and shootaround, but some of my worst nights have been where I've felt really good in warmups. I feel like there's no correlation, to be honest with you. It's just the rhythm of the game and feel for the game when you're out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOSH GREEN,"I put Luka up for sure. Luka, Patrick Beverley. I dont know. The third one is up for debate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOSH GREEN,"My G.O.A.T. is Kobe Bryant. Growing up, that's the reason I play basketball. Thats the person I pretended to be like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOSH GREEN,"I think it's definitely a bit of a challenge when you get to be where you feel like you do have spare time, and it's finding out the best ways to be able to use that spare time. For me, I enjoy being around my family and playing video games. I love FIFA. So that's usually what I do in my spare time. I love coffee. So I tend to really just do that type of thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOSH GREEN,"Just drink a lot of water, man. That's my advice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOSH GREEN,"I think it's a little bit of everything. I think it's do-or-die, and I think we know that we weren't playing to the level that we should be playing. So I think whenever we play games like that, it's enjoyable. I think we need to continue to ride that momentum and make the adjustments from the game that we won and be ready to go for tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just piggybacking off what we did in Game 4, trying to take it to the next step, taking it one game at a time. Having a lot of patience and staying motivated, staying encouraged."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It's a long series. We can make it a long series if we do the right things. We have a small margin of error, and we are going to make sure that that margin stays small."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was a lot of fun being around the home crowd, had a lot of energy in the arena and just doing the things that just kind of like made the game fun. You know, you put a lot of love into the game, you get a lot of love back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Trying to stay consistent in those areas, what we succeeded in, how we were there for each other and how we picked each other up and staying positive. That game, we were playing desperate. We didnt want to go home. Just give us some type of life, and that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just brought me back to life in all honesty. I felt like I had a terrible start and I didn't really get to a point of playing until like the third because of the simple fact of the mistakes that I made out on the floor, which obviously, like at the end of the day, I'm never going to complain whenever they make that change, which is taking me often floor when I'm not out there being at my best."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Scored a couple of baskets down the stretch, got the blocks, gave us a lot of energy at the time because I felt like I was actually doing something to impact and help the team win. It was a breath of fresh air, I would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Last game, I felt like we got a lot more comfortable, wasn't worried about the mistakes or anything like that. Maybe I was worried about mine at the beginning but just throughout the game, just seeing how guys were playing and just the energy and the effort that was given out there on the floor it, would have been a big slap to the face to those guys if I would have never came out and did the same thing. Like I said, we got comfortable for sure just playing and having fun with the game, doing the right things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, you know, I don't think he really said anything to the refs as much the last game. Just shows that he's taking that step in the right direction. We have to be able to do the same thing. When it comes to the path to success, there's a lot of failure in that. You have to use those failures as a lesson to really just go down that path and keep going and just find some type of way to be better than the last."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not lately. I would say living in the past when it comes to something like that, I feel that would pull me further away from the game where I am at right now. I dont really worry about how my journey started off, I care about how I finish my journey."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,Obviously we are going to be upbeat. We're focused throughout practice on what we have to do. It's just about being relaxed and making sure we're ready once the game comes.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,"We know it's going to be loud and it's going to be an atmosphere the fans want to see them win, but it's our job to stop that as much as possible. We know it's going to be loud and rowdy. We just need to make sure that we stick to our game plan and stick together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,"I think that's the thing is making sure I stay ready and then when I come in, doing what I can, and that's bringing pace, trying to relieve as much as possible for Luka and Ky when Im out there bringing up the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,But letting the game come to me as well. I think that's the most important thing. Not trying to go out there and score 50 points or whatever. It's just about playing in the game plan and attacking where I can attack.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,"I do think so. I think it showed a lot about us. But I think the key for us is going to be do that when it gets hard and when it gets tough. We've seen where they hit a couple threes or coming out of a timeout, they will hit two or three threes, and it's just about how do we react to that and get back to our game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's been a lot of reflecting on that. Even just looking at this year and playing in the NBA Finals and going to an Olympic Games, the two biggest stages in the world. So I think I'm forever grateful. It's easy to take it for granted, but I've been through injuries and not being able to play and missed out on events. I'm just making sure I do everything, and grateful that I'm on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,"Hopefully. Obviously he had a great career. And if I can do something like that, it would be amazing. But it's going to start here, and hopefully we can get this next win and keep building with that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, that's the only way we can look at it. If we lose, we're going home. So we need to make sure that we win every quarter, every possession. I think that's kind of the mindset is make every possession important, and then if we do that, we can win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DANTE EXUM,"I think it shows a lot of character with us with being able to fight. You know, we could have been on vacation now, but I think it shows how we want it as a team, and we are ready to fight for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,"I would say Real Madrid is in a league of their own. They are at the top of the Euro. But obviously Boston has been -- I think Boston, Lakers, they are obviously the two major NBA teams in the league and they have been since day one. So it's obviously a little bit of comparison."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's obviously different because it's the Finals. Every team plays the whole season to be here. We are the one to be here in Boston, obviously. So it's a little bit different. But you've got to play basketball. You've got to give everything you have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, we talk about it. I think the most important thing is to show that we believe. I think we showed in Game 4. If not, if we wouldn't believe, we probably wouldn't have won that game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,"So I think obviously the talk is easy to talk about it, but then showing it is another thing. I think we showed it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,The change is we needed to win the game. I think we didn't play our best the first three games. So we had to change something and play better in Game 4.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,"At this point in the season, a lot of things going on. If I'm playing, I'm fine. No worries."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,"I think everyone. Everyone. In the preseason, that was our key discussion, how to talk on defense. When we put it together and we play good defense, everybody is talking. Communication is a big part of our success on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,Not really. Just happy being a father. It's been the best thing in my life. So that's it. Just being happy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,LUKA DONCIC,It was a very special moment. I know they are both -- I think they are very proud of their sons. So they are happy that we're happy on the court together.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"We have a great group, resilient group, and we don't like to lose. We do our best to prepare each and every night, each and every game, and we look forward to the next game on the schedule."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just by being disciplined. Controlling the pace. Felt like there was a lot of stoppages in Game 4 where they were blowing the whistle a lot. But we want to get up and create more of a pace to the game, and I think that helps dictate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we are ready for Game 5. I think that's the best answer that I got. I think that we're ready. We're at home, and we're looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's definitely a blessing to be here, to represent the Celtics, my family, the organization, the community, our greater community. It's an honor that I don't take lightly. So just to come out every night and play for something, for what I represent, I think that matters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"My relationship with Boston has grown. I've been here for almost nine years now, since I was 18, 19 years old. I've grown up. I've become a man here. Boston is special. I'm looking forward to Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just that you can't take it for granted, and it's going to be difficult. You're going to have to fight and just stay in the moment. That's what matters the most. We come out and be a team. Win as a team, lose as a team. Just come out and be the best versions of ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the only experience that you can really experience that you can really speak from in the playoffs. At this level, you have some very talented basketball players who are going to be on the floor, and you've got to bring it every single night. And if you don't, you can see what happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,This is what we all work for. We are at the precipice of completing what we set out to do at the beginning of the season.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYLEN BROWN,"So I think it's not difficult to get everybody in that locker room on the same page right now. It just needs to remind everybody that it's just one possession at a time. We do it together and we fight like our lives depends on it, and I think we'll be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERRICK WHITE,A simple way an ass kicking. Thats the simplest way right there.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we felt good, felt confident. Just didnt play the way weve been playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERRICK WHITE,"Not exactly. But, as weve seen today, they just played harder, and thats unacceptable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that they played harder. Every loose ball, 50-50 ball, they got to it. Honestly, the turnovers, missed shots -- combined thats not a winning recipe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. Like you said, a year ago this time, we were down 0-3 and we were essentially fighting for our lives."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"So very short answer, yeah, we understand what it's like from their point of view, and you know, they came out super aggressive. They played extremely fast and took more shots than we did. You know, they were really concentrating on attacking the offensive glass. They got way more rebounds than we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"So, you know, they played harder tonight. Obviously, we didn't shoot the ball well at all. It's something that we can learn from."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"Give them credit. They played well tonight and we didn't. We had the right mindset and right intentions. We wanted to come out and play super well and win, but it just didn't go that way tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"But, you know, we are fortunate. We get another opportunity on Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, not to harp on it too much. It happened. We can't change what happened tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, we always say you lose by two or you lose by 30 they all count the same. But we do need to be better. We're not making any excuses. We need to be better, and we will. We will be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think we were a little -- I think this is the most stagnant that we've been this series and the worst job of owning our space on the offensive end and doing what we wanted to do instead of what they were forcing us to do. And, you know, we did a great job of that the first three games, and this one, we didn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"I think it starts on the defensive end for us. We didn't get many stops. So they were allowed to set their defense up, and just naturally, when you're scoring at a high rate, you feel good about yourself. Your energy is higher. Tend to probably play better defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"So it all starts on the defensive end. We've just got to do a much better job containing them, making it tougher, and getting stops."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"A little bit of both. You have to, to move on from it, win or a loss. We're obviously going to watch film and see a lot of things that we need to clean up and do better. But you can't worry about it too much because we have another game on Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"Like I said, not making any excuses. We've got to be a lot better, and I believe that we will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYSON TATUM,"I think it's going to be as loud as it's ever been, in my seven years of being a Celtic. Excited to go back home. Celebrate Father's Day on Sunday and compete for a championship on Monday. So it should be a lot of fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's not quite there, but we're going to make him available. But we're only going to use him in very specific instances if necessary."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just have an understanding of the environment. So at the end of the day, both teams have to keep the same edge and same chip on their shoulder. But you can't be distracted by anything. It really doesn't matter what kind of game it is. If you don't run back on defense, you can't win. If you don't rebound, you can't win. If you don't execute, you can't win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"So just focusing on the details, the effort, the execution, all the things that go into winning regardless if it's preseason, regular season, postseason, or the Finals. The process towards winning remains the same. We just have to hammer that home and for however long it takes, stick to that process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,Not quite there. He's available but only in very specific situational instances.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah. He's not quite there. He's available. We'll use him in very specific instances laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"I haven't really thought about that. Focused on Game 4. One of my favorite places in the world, so that's it for now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, I have different routines, whether home or away, but they are relatively the same. Yeah, about the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think obviously having an understanding of the environment and what we are trying to accomplish. But I think we've done that throughout most of the season when we've been able to dominate the transitions and the margins of the game, and when we've played well and not played well, still give ourselves a chance because of the margins and the discipline in these things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Dallas is a great opponent because they test your discipline, like every single possession, and the second that you're not where you're supposed to be or you don't execute your angles properly, they take advantage of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"So our opponent has forced us to work to be more disciplined, and we have to stay that way for however long the series continues."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"You can definitely take something from it but at the same time, I thought Dallas played great. Give a lot of credit to them. You know, all their guys, whoever went in, well-balanced."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Thought they played with a ton of energy and physicality. You've got to give them that. And they are a great team, and that's Dallas. That's the reason why they are here when they play like that. But you can definitely take some stuff from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"They did a great job flying around, making indecision on whether to shoot it or drive and their multiple efforts. And I thought their five men did a great job protecting the paint. Whenever we went in for a layup, they had multiple guys contesting. I thought they did a great job flying around on the defensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I don't know, always in situations like this, it always goes back to us. But you have to give Dallas credit. They played well. They played really, really well. And that's the reason why that they're in this, is because when they play like that. So I thought they just outplayed us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Preparation doesn't guarantee an automatic success. And so I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn't think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"You have to prepare to put yourself in the best possible position, but it doesn't guarantee anything. At the end of the day, we have to just maintain our process and get ready for Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Anytime there's two-on-ones and little indecisions, they do a great job cutting behind you and wedging under and getting in. I thought Lively was great in that. We had 26 misses in the first half and only two offensive rebounds, and they had more. So we've got to be better in our defensive rebounding, and we have to be better getting offensive rebounds when we miss."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I learned that Dallas is a great team and you're going to have to earn it. There's a lot of stuff that we can control. We'll go back on the film and we'll watch that, and we'll really try to be disciplined and control it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't know. I thought Dallas played really -- the more I said it, because you have to give them credit. It's not about us. It's about our opponent and having respect for them. And you have to give them credit for how well they played, and that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,So it's less about us and more about how they played. They played well. They played hard. We have to be more disciplined in how we defend and attack them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JOE MAZZULLA,It wasn't as good as Dallas's was. I thought theirs was a lot better.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,I'm not comfortable. We got to win. We got to have a lot more wins. We got to win a lot more of the little battles. Got to stay disciplined. We just got to replicate what we did this game. Do it the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"A mix between a bunch of fruits -- not vegetables -- bunch of fruits, and just some recovery stuff. Making sure by body don't cramp or anything like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"They're my family. We've developed a lot of trust with one another, a lot of chemistry. That trust just comes down to if you get blown by, they know I have their back. Just at the same time, I know if I got blown by, I got people behind me to back me up. It's really just doing whatever up can to make sure whenever one steps, we're all stepping with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,It's for her. She helped me make it. She's going to help me make a lot more. She helped me make the free throw. She helped me make reads.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,I'm just happy for having Luka pass me the ball in that position. I'm happy I knocked it down. Just got to be able to make the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"If they leave me open in the corner, I'm going to get them up, for sure. It's just having that trust. Luka is going to give me the ball. As soon as I shot it, he kind of jumped for joy when it went in. Just having that reaction from my teammates is just amazing. Makes you want to just learn, just practice and just do more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"Whatever doesn't kill you really makes you stronger. No matter how many times you get hit, knocked down, get up, get up harder than you got knocked down. Hit them harder than they hit you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"As I jogged down, I slowly heard it. It kept getting louder and louder. Whenever you have the fans hyped like that, backing you up, it makes you want to play that much more free, with that much more energy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"I'm happy he was able to get out there, feel the energy, feel everything about the experience. He hasn't been able to step on the floor for a long time now because he has been hurt."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just going out there, I was telling him to slow down, just enjoy it, feel your way through this game. Don't rush anything, just feel your way through the game, find little holes, absorb it all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"I know he did. I know he's thinking about a lot of things, but I got a lot of trust in O Max."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"I wouldn't say it's comfortability. I feel like we go out there and we play like we're desperate. That's the mentality we need to have in these games, going out there doing whatever you can to win. No matter if you're diving out of bounds, diving at the ball, chesting up with somebody, trying to be aggressive and strong."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"A lot of this playoff season, playoff series, has just been finding out who we are, finding how much can we get hit and then throw one back. It's definitely been an enjoyable time to just see my teammates and myself just grow and adapt with one another with what's going on on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, he trusts us. He trusts us to know he's going to play the best defense he can with as much energy as he's got. If they get by him, he knows we're going to back him up. He knows exactly what we're going to do and how we have his back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"Only thing I told him, Look, going out there, first two times you get fouled, don't say nothing to the refs. That's all I got. Just please don't do that, and I'll make sure you get open, make sure you're going be comfortable on the offensive and defensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"So just knowing that whenever he is going out there playing defense and he's locked in on defense, he just makes everything fall into place better on the offensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,I wouldn't say we're overly happy. We enjoyed this win. But we're not jumping for joy. We got to win. We do what we need to do for this game. Now it's getting into Game 5.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DERECK LIVELY II,"We're going into another hostile environment. Now we just got to take from what we did this game, learn to how they're going to adapt to this game, do whatever we can to emulate, make this happen again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a really good question in the sense of the talk is, you know, no different than 1, 2 or 3. You know, we have a game plan. We've got to play faster. We've got to guard the three."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about the record or the series is 3-0, somewhere in this game, there's going to be a point where either team is going to have to make a stand or they let go of the rope."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so that's just human nature. And so if it happens to be us in the sense we are down or we're fighting to get back in the game, there's going to be a point, if there's going to be a fight, or do we just concede."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Or vice versa, where Boston goes, we've got another one on Monday. That's what -- there will be a point in this game where someone is going to have to make a stand or they let go especially of the rope. We'll see when that point comes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"I think when you talk about the three games, getting off to a good start is one, and then the fight at the end. You know, we're playing from behind, and we have to play perfect. These are positive things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"But again, we have to play with pace. And somewhere between the second quarter and third quarter we tend to just walk the ball, and that's the benefit to Boston. Tonight we have to leave the -- the gas tank has to be empty at the pace of not walking but running for 48 minutes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think -- I don't get involved with the medical. So I just repeat questionable or probable or whatever he's taking."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,So I let that -- that's between medical and the player. So I can't comment about what -- if he taking a shot.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"But injuries are part of the game, and it's June. Everybody's sore and tired mentally. And so it's about survival. It's about being able to understand if you've been here before, you have to train to play to June. And so these are a lot of lessons, not just for Luka but a lot of my guys are learning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Great question. I think when you talk about our bench, we need everybody to score. And then when you talk about our team, we need everybody to score more points. It's not just our bench. It's not just Luka and Ky scoring. We need everybody to pitch in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,We are getting great looks. Unfortunately we just haven't made them. So tonight hopefully is the night that everybody will be able to score.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"But our bench has been, you know, someone that has helped us win in the playoffs, and we are going to need them tonight. Someone off the bench, Maxi, D-Live, Josh, Exum, someone has to be able to step up and make an open shot for us tonight, and we truly believe that will happen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at today's athlete, the game of sport is not to be perfect. It's just, you know, to win. And when you look at what's come out here in the last day or so, if you've watched the Mavs, Luka has improved his defense. But we are asking him, or some are asking him, to be a shutdown defender."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Well, he's never been on an All-Defensive Team, but he's been on five All-Pro Teams, first team. So that means he's one of the top five players in the world, and he's playing the game the right way where he can find open guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"But when you're on the biggest stage, there's got to be -- someone's got to poke a hole. This will only make the great ones better. When you look at, we talked about it yesterday, with LeBron, Michael, the greats, the G.O.A.T.s, they all were poked at and they came back stronger and better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"I truly believe Luka will come back stronger and better. Some criticize that he could never get this far. But he's here. And unfortunately as a team, he said it best We win together and we lose together. And that's -- we lost three in a row. We are trying to find a way tonight to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"But sometimes when you are a free agent in the media business, you've got to say something crazy to get a new contract, or likes, or clicks."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"No, I think it's just everybody has -- this is a free country. Everybody has the right to their opinion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is a special group when you talk about that group in that locker room. They protect one another. They play for one another. They play the game the right way. They cheer for one another."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,And so is there extra? I don't think there's going to be extra. I think the motivation right now is to get off to a good start and find a way to get a win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"But nothing changes about the way the group feels about Luka. Tonight I expect everybody to play their A Game. I think sometimes we -- you know, the Celtics are a good team. Let's not forget that. It's not that we are not playing defense or it's been blowouts. It's just been a couple mistakes that they have taken advantage of that we will learn from as we go forward, and if we are ever in this situation again, hopefully we can use that experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,D Live was great. His energy was great. His ability to give us second opportunities. He displayed his range tonight with the corner three.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"He was really good. He's been good. Giving us second opportunities, picking up a foul, getting the offensive rebound, was needed. I thought he did a really good job this evening."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"We had to play our A game. It was this or we go on vacation. I thought the group did a great job of not pressing, letting the game happen. The flow was there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"We've done this in the first three games. It's just we haven't been able to capitalize. We made the mistakes, and they've capitalized on it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"They shot the three well. We tried to keep them off the free-throw line tonight, not give them second opportunities. I thought they did a really good job of being able to execute the game plan and let the game come to us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,We made awesome shots. Our role players stepped up and made some threes. That's what we needed tonight.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he was great. He's been great. Some would say differently. He's averaging over 25 in this series, I think. He's playing at a very high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,I don't know so much respond. He's been doing everything for us on the offensive end and defensive end. I thought he played his game tonight. He didn't force anything. I thought he was rebounding and let other guys...
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"With the pace, we talked about it, we got to play faster. I thought he set the pace for us tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"I thought they were great. It was a carryover from Game 3. I thought the energy group that ended in Game 3, fourth quarter, the group, energy and pace on both ends. Defensively we got stops. Offensively we got into the paint where we could capitalize. I thought Josh's energy has been great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The defense, again, in this series has been really good. It's just for us, it comes down to not making a mistake at the wrong time, and tonight we didn't do that. We capitalized on their mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"It thought it was great. He was Luka. He's been Luka. There wasn't a different Luka out there. He played at a high level. He was great. He's been great. He's one of the best players in the world. As much as we want to criticize, he's a hell of a player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, the score. It's real simple. We don't have to complicate this. This isn't surgery."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate. Understand, we made a stand. We were desperate. We got to continue to keep playing that way understand they're trying to find a way to close the door."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight you saw that. They let go of the rope, you know, pretty early."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"No, he was in the right spot. He took it from there. He can shoot. That's the next step for his development, is being able to shoot the three. He's young. But as a 20-year-old, he's grown up in the AAU circuit where in high school, he could shoot, he could handle. He'd tell you he played point guard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"His ability to be able to bring the ball, being able to shoot the three is the next step for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"He has all the skill set. Right now, for the role we need him to do, is do what he did tonight offensive rebound, change shots and be able to guard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's who we've been all season. Exum has played at a high level for us all season. He's been able to run the offense. He stepped up and made big shots for us to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Then I thought tonight even the one he shot from out of bounds, he made it, that could easily have changed his confidence. He was aggressive while he was out on the floor. He was great. We're going to need that on the road."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, again, we are desperate. The ball starts to move. Guys are not overthinking it. Again, being able to make some threes tonight from our role players were huge when you talk about D Jones, Exum and then D Live."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,Just understanding that's who we've been all season. We can shoot with the best of them. Tonight we displayed that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think, again, we have nothing to lose going to Boston. That mindset of being aggressive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"Then to answer the first part of your question, Luka, as we know, can play defense. You saw that tonight. Some of the criticism that he's had here of late, for whatever reason, talked about his defense. I think he stepped up and was there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"He knows in Boston he's going to be right back in the pick-and-roll, so he's going to have to compete and play defense again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"I thought everybody who participated today was ready. I thought O Max, as a rookie coming off of injury, I thought he did a good job getting his first minutes in the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just by putting it into perspective what we're up against. History is going to be made either way. We'd like to be on the right side of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"It just comes from the same sentiment, same phrase I was using the other day, just putting our best foot forward. We felt like Game 3 we had a good chance to close out that game to at least put is in a competitive spot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,We waited until Game 4 to ultimately play our best game. Took long enough for all of us to get to the party together and to play for each other the way we did tonight.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"But it's definitely a possibility that we can replicate it. We understand we're going against the same great Boston team that is going to make it tough. We're going into their home den. We have another opportunity to extend the season. That's all we can ask for. We handled our business tonight. But the job is still an uphill battle, and we understand that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"It was how we started off the game. Our ability to go home, get some rest, not having the same 48 hours to get our bodies ready and recover. So it felt like it was pretty much the regular season in terms of that aspect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think he made a few people eat their words. In a healthy way -- I'll say that in a healthy way. I don't want to curse up here or anything like that, get into any unnecessary beef, right, between us as players and the media."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think this is his first opportunity and first taste of what it's like to be on this stage, and to not play up to your capabilities or be out there toward the end of the game where every mistake is magnified. I think that's probably what I'm really referring to, is when every mistake is magnified, there is going to be a response. That's your guys' job to give us your criticism. We go home and deal with it in a healthy way, hopefully."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think with Luka, like I've been reiterating to the guys, stay off social media as best you can, man. Enjoy the moment we're in. It's not about making it this far. It's figuring out of the little nuances to get wins on this stage. That's what it's about for us as competitors and that's where our focus should be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,He responded very well. I expected it. I think a lot of people expected it that have seen Luka and known Luka. Just didn't know how it was going to happen. He made some things happen tonight that I was very proud of him. He grew.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what we've been talking about, too, since the beginning of the series, is our growth, us trending in the right direction, figuring out how we get wins together as a group with all those external factors still going on. How do you still lock in, how do you still focus in, breathe through some of those mistakes. I think he did a great job of that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"Hopefully, we can still extend this series going into Game 5. But we still know we have to play our best and control what we can control."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,Yeah. Crazy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"It's taken time, I tell you that. It's difficult because, as a competitor, you try not to display all your emotions out there to give an edge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"Rightfully so, yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think it shows you how important it is to have quality leaders in the locker room and somebody that has been through it, somebody that can talk through it, and also somebody that's more than willing to sacrifice themselves to take the bullets and the brunt of the responsibility."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"He knows how important it is for us to focus on the right things. We can't be focused on answering all these unfair, critical questions. Some of them may be fair, right? But if you're not necessarily out there playing with us, it's going to be hard for us to connect if you're talking s--- about one of our teammates."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"We're not going to go for it. I think that's what you're seeing. Not just from us, but our head coach."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"He's dealt with his fair share of criticism from some of you guys in this room, some guys in the past. Some of you criticize him as a coach, rightfully so, like I said."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think if it goes over a certain boundary, you're going to see a real humans step up and protect their brother or sister. I think that's what you saw from J Kidd. I am proud of him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I have the same sentiment. That's out little brother right there. He's in the Finals. He's going to make mistakes. That's also why I kind of had that kind of peaceful sentiment about me after the game. I'm not about to go up to Luka and say, It's all your fault. That's not how it works in our locker room. We dang sure don't want to start those bad habits now. I've been on teams where we have allowed the media or opinions to infiltrate what we have going on, and it has not worked out well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think if we put our best foot forward and focus on the things we can control, we got a good thing going here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, if you're familiar with D Live's game, you know in high school he was shooting those threes. He was on a pretty good team that ended up winning a few championships together. D Live had an expanded game, sort of to say, when he was in high school. It's crazy. I was watching highlights not too long ago."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I think what we have to also account for is we're in a very physical game. When you're getting beat up like that out there every single play, you're going to have something to say to the refs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"In Luka's case, his relationship with the refs is not always the healthiest during games. The referees are humans, too. We have to respect what they do. They're a big part of this game, too. It could sway either way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think what you're seeing is him just taking accountability as best he can at this point in his life. He's a young person, still trying to figure it out. I give him that grace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"Also, we have to give him a little tough love where we let him know and reiterate you got to stay off those guys a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"I think it's just lessons being learned. When he is locked in like that, not paying attention to the refs, he's a huge, impactful player for us, and a great leader for us. We want him to stay consistent on that and not be too hard on himself either. If he gets a tech, so be it. No one is batting an eye. If we're trying to get back into the game and we need the refs, there has to be a different perspective, different approach you got to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,KYRIE IRVING,"Sometimes a good conversation works with the refs. Sometimes eye-to-eye conversation works with them. When you're s--- talking them, MF'ing them all the time, it can get to them too. I'm not saying we're all perfect, but we have to use everything to our advantage on a positive note."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"I think it was more about Dallas. You know, I felt like they were the better team tonight, clearly. They played much better, and you've got to give them credit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I felt like we came out determined. They were the better team. They were the team that was playing harder. He's right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we have an opportunity here to be better, and it all starts with us going over this film and having a good practice session and understanding the opportunity we have in front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,So that's what we're going to do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I just know, there could have been some of that. Ultimately, you know, I felt like they were the better team tonight. We can say all these things about us. They played much better than us. They clearly outplayed us, and that's tough to take but that's the reality."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I don't know specifically. It just seemed like a lot of stuff was going their way, and I'm just eager to just look at this film and get together and see how we can be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"The one thing I can tell you about our group is that time and time again, we've responded any time we have adversity, and this is an opportunity that we have here front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. We definitely have to be better. Have to be more active and make sure that we're a little more aware of him, and it's something that I expect us to be better come Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I feel like every series kind of has a life of its own. But yeah, they were in a position that their backs were against the wall, and they did what they were supposed to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"It is hard to win on the road. And even though we've had a lot of success this postseason on the road, you know, they had the momentum. They kept it going, and that was a big difference. Their crowd really rallied behind them and I feel like that helped them throughout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's hard. It's a playoff series. Teams are going back and forth. Usually, you know, I've been in a lot of these, and usually by the second game, you're making adjustments. Third game, you're making another adjustment, and that's kind of how it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"And for us, we've had the first three games, we didn't really make any adjustments. So today, they did something. We have to see what we can -- how we can be better and prepare for it. That's kind of where we're at right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"But, you know, it's the playoffs, and, you know, they are fighting for their lives, and they played better than us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,I think we always fall back on our work and preparation and understanding what we need to do. It's not going to be any different now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's a good question. Understanding that it's one game. You know, after we won Game 1, we put that behind us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"You know, Game 2, kind of same thing and so on, and we are at this point now. You know, we have to take some things that we can be better at and try to fix them, and then you know, others kind of throw them out and just kind of do that and make sure that we come out and we play Celtics basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,AL HORFORD,"I think ultimately that's what it comes down to for us, and there's a lot of things that we can control and that I expect us to be much better on Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Take care of the things that we can control. Got to fight for rebounds. We've got to, me in particular, not turn the ball over and just be aggressive. Be the more desperate team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I mean, I wouldn't say throw it away. We've got to learn from it. Things that we have to go back and watch. Again, see the things that we should have controlled and done better doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,But going back and watching film and getting better.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"In particular, no. I think they let me play one-on-one, so whenever I drive, I think they all kind of space out and let me try to play one-on-one at the basket. Just got to do better playing off my teammates and finishing at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"We learn from wins, too. Wins we have opportunities to get better. Again, same thing with losses."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"So not sure it changes much. Got to get home. Get our rest, hydrate and lock back in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think winning is hard. I think winning at any game is hard. But winning Game 4 of the NBA Finals is pretty damn hard. So no, I think they came out desperate and I think they punched us in the mouth, and we couldn't kind of recover the way we wanted to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I guess a massive win would be -- I don't know. I think role players came in and they felt good. Obviously they are at home. But things that we have to control, we'll do our best to do that and come back at home and do the best we can to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know. I don't know. Even though I've done it. You've got to do it together as a team. Everybody has to be clicking and being, again, the more desperate team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"We've just got to go back home. I think locking into tendencies, locking into the game plan, and I think we'll be okay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I thought we got a lot of good shots. I think a lot of them didn't fall. A lot of the plays we made before didn't go in the hoop. You saw a couple go in and out. Again, just a couple plays didn't go our way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,"So credit to Dallas. They played extremely hard. They played desperate, and we've got to do the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think the series is we are up 3-1 going back to Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,SAM HAUSER,"That was a butt whupping. Thats it. They just beat us. Not much to it, honestly. They just beat us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,SAM HAUSER,"Its a learning lesson, for sure. Got to show up and show out every night. Theyre not going to roll over. Theyre down 3-1 now. Theyre desperate, so theyre not going to roll over. Theyre not going to make it easy on us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, Im sure well break it down, learn from it and take what we need to get better at and any carry it on to Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,SAM HAUSER,Be better. About it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,SAM HAUSER,Cant wait. Wish we could do it right now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think for me, it's just come in and do what I do with my minutes. I think obviously Luka creates a lot of attention. Just using that to my advantage to get downhill. I've been super confident in my shot all year. Unfortunate that one of them was taken away. I just have to stay confident and keep shooting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"No, I think just the energy that we showed throughout the team. Even when stuff didn't go our way, it wasn't heads down. It was next possession, next possession. That's something we've kind of preached the whole series. I think we were finally able to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I mean, you said it. A lot of the times guys go through ups and downs. It's just about getting back in the gym, doing our craft, what we know. Whether that's lifting, shooting, extra reps, anything. You see everyone on this team doing that. And it shows on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"No, no. I think obviously Luka has to hold himself to a high standard. Him fouling out doesn't give us the best position to win. Obviously we need him on the court, and he knows that. I know he's going to, as a competitor, hold himself accountable. We did, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"One of the biggest things is I go on the court and I think I'm going to be on Tatum or Brown. Kyrie is, No, I've got him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think that's huge. I can press the ball, be up and play on the help side. I mean, just for Kyrie to kind of step up and say, I'm going to take that defensive challenge, it's huge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"Like I said, there's a lot of ups and downs that go through a series. Just the Playoffs in general. I think we knew kind of what we can do and how we can be. Obviously, we know not every game is going to be like that. I think if we stick to kind of who we are as a team and stay positive, we just need to take one game at a time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think criticism is always going to come when we lose. I think if we won a game or two, the criticism isn't as bad."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"J Kidd, he played, so he understands it. All competitors, they're going to take it on the chin, come out. That's the challenge that we have to do every game. Obviously, we watch it because we're on our phones a lot. It's just coming out and playing our basketball, and that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think it's contagious. I come in, I do it. Everyone starts to build that pace. Everyone's running their lanes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,"Just helps out my team. We were locked in, especially on the defense end. We played with pace. It helped them. I'm here to help them in every way I can. We just got to play like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it doesn't change anything. Like I said at the beginning of the series, it's first to four. We going to believe until the end. So we just got to keep going. I have big belief in this team that we can do it, so we just got to keep believing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,It's big. It's basketball. It's five people on the floor. So that's huge for us. Everybody played with a lot of energy. That's how we got to do it. We got to think the same way in Game 5 in Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't know what I learn of myself. Ask me the next day, I'll come up with the answer. I don't know really right now smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,But it's going to take everything. It's going to take energy -- especially energy -- because it's late in the season. We played a lot of games. We got to stay together and locked in.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,"No, he didn't say anything to me specifically. But that speaks a lot about him. He always has players' backs. He always support us. That's a big thing, to have a coach like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,"Big-time, man. I think people forget he's a rookie. He's a rookie doing this stuff. He's been amazing the whole season. Just watching him grow was unbelievable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,LUKA DONCIC,All right. 1-for-1 -- he's 100 in the Playoffs.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,I don't even know how to answer that. Next question.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"Give credit to Dallas. I think they played hard physically, and then they dominated the glass. I think that was the key that put a lot of pressure on us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"And then we didn't make shots tonight, and I think that's where, you know, we allowed them to play free, once we get them multiple opportunities to make shots, and then also we didn't hit shots on the other end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"We're going to look at the film and see where we can better, and then go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's a great opportunity to respond. Give credit to Dallas. They came out and they played with force, and they played great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"We just regroup. We keep our same mentality, and we come out and get ready to fight in another battle on our home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"We learn from it. We take it. We don't dismiss it. We're going to learn from it. We're going to see how and why, exactly where the game was won and lost. And then we take those experiences and then we come out and we play like our life depends on it. Because it does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"Close-out games are hard. Close-out games are tough. They always have been like that, and you've got to have extreme focus. You've got to come out and meet their intensity to finish things out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"So we didn't do that tonight. Give credit to Dallas. I thought they played extremely well. Those guys, they crashed, they rebounded and they played with force. Some of those other guys stepped up. We've got to be better and we've got to have some of our guys step up, and that's what it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,I felt like the pace slowed down a little bit which allowed them to dictate what they wanted to do. I think we have to continue to keep the pace but have some more poise. Just see where we can be better. We'll watch film and we'll see.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"Right now, it feels raw, so we've just got to look at film and go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"These are the moments that can make you or break you. We have to reassemble. We have to look at it and learn from it, and then we've got to embrace it and attack it. It's going to be hard to do what we're trying to do. We didn't expect anything to be easy, but it's no reason to lose our head."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"Tip your cap to Dallas. They came out and played well, and we've just got to be better on the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure as of yet. But we're going to watch it. We're going to learn from it. As of now, we've just got to be better. We have to meet their intensity. It's the NBA playoffs. It's the Finals. Looking forward to the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah. He was excited for me to be here. I think he was like, I remember watching you when I was with the select team at USA, and I think he just saw something in me then, that he believed I could help us win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,"He's a great basketball mind, and it just goes to show you never really know who's watching."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I remember he told me about what it was going to be like to play for the Celtics and the crowd, the city, everything. It's just been so much better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,I love playing there and just competing in the TD Garden. Hardy was amazing for me. He's an amazing coach. I think he kind of undersold it a little bit.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, it's playing with great players. They put me in a position to be in those moments, and they trust me. Just try to be confident throughout it all and just trust the work that I've put in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say he was a big talker. He just gets it done. Both sides of the court, just his physicality, just impacts the game in so many different ways. Just does literally everything on the court, and just does it at a really high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,"No, I mean, you knew he was a big-time competitor. You don't guard the way he guards and not be a big-time competitor. But you don't really see all the little things he does until you see it like day in and day out and just the way he just impacts winning every second he's out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK WHITE,"I think we just locked in. I don't know exactly what it is. But we're just locked in. We know what's at stake. We understand that close-out games are the toughest, and we just come with an extra edge. It's going to be even harder tomorrow, and we've got to be even better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"I think from our experiences over the past couple of years, the thing that we've really gotten a lot better at is not relaxing, not being complacent. From game to game or series to series, we always want more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"Maybe in recent years we took things for granted at some points or were happy to make it to certain rounds, where now we're not satisfied."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"Even now up 3-0, nobody is celebrating or anything. We still feel like there's a lot more that we can do. There's a lot more that we want to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"From that standpoint, just not being complacent and everybody just wanting more and being true to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"You said Summer League? I was excited to finally put on an NBA jersey. I was young. I was 19. I was overwhelmed. Everything was new to me, from being at the new practice facility."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"I remember going through Summer League practice with -- JB was on the team, obviously, and learning from him and learning from the assistant coaches. Jerome Allen was there Micah Shrewsberry was one of the coaches. It was a hell of an experience, in Utah and in Vegas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"I was just so happy to be in the NBA at the time that -- I was really a kid. It was a great experience, and obviously we've grown a lot since then. But I was just so happy to be there and put on that jersey for the first time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, ever since I've been in the NBA, especially with the Celtics, everybody knows we only hang up championship banners, and it's been a while since we've won one. Ever since '08, the goal is to win another one every single year. Gotten close plenty of times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"It's just an honor. It's a honor to wear this jersey. It's an honor to follow in the footsteps of some of the best players ever. Being a part of Celtics history entails that you've got to win a championship. Every kid growing up playing basketball dreams about being in the Finals, dreams about winning a championship. I'm no different than anybody else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"I credited last year a lot to the success that we're having this season. We were so consumed with getting back to the Finals, in a good way, but I think especially when we got to the Playoffs, we were just ready to get back to June. In some ways skipping steps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"Those series took longer than they maybe should have, and we acknowledge that. We could have closed games out a lot earlier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"You find yourself in a hole down 0-3, the margin for error is so small. Last year, we really believed that we could take it one game at a time and come back from that series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"But last year was a great learning experience. For one, to not take things for granted. You're never promised to make it back to the Finals. I think each and every person this year has came into the season with a different mindset. I think it has truly shown that we don't take things for granted, and we approach every single day the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"We're trying to get better, and we're as hungry as we've ever been."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"Actually, yeah, somebody did walk me around the old practice facility in Waltham and showed me all the banners and the history."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"I was born in '98, so I didn't really know about all the championships before. I knew Bill Russell won a lot. I knew Bird had a couple. But I only ever saw '08, and then when they lost in 2010. I learned a lot about the history of the game, the history of the Celtics."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,I would say the first legend I met was Paul Pierce. I met him during that -- it might have been Summer League or my first training camp he was around for a few days. That was the first Celtics legend I really got to talk to.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"I think our ability to go over situational basketball during practice. Joe and the coaching staff, they do a great job of showing us a lot of different things throughout the season of how games end, whether it's teams being up six, do you foul, or closing out quarters and how that can have an effect for the start of the next quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"So going over situational basketball in practice and in shootarounds and understanding what we want to do in those moments, what plays and reads we want to go over in late-game situations, so when those moments do come about throughout the game, we're comfortable. We know what we're trying to run, what we're trying to get to, the different options from each set."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,Just our ability to translate the things that we go over in practice to the game and do it without skipping a beat.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYSON TATUM,"I didn't know that. That would be really cool. But you know, you guys will probably say we didn't play anybody to get here. So we'll just have to do it again next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I really don't listen to a lot of them. I don't really have a favorite quote. But I just think he says a lot of things that are -- like a lot of things that people don't usually say, but they have great meaning behind them, and they resonate with our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's a great player. Just tried to make things tough, make him hit tough one-on-one buckets over and over again. That's kind of what we're living with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just like to show the world that I'm a good defender and I can guard some of the best guys in the world, especially those two. They're the best. Just doing my job, staying in front, making things tough. I try to take pride in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's tough when you're playing limited minutes and he hasn't played at times, so when you see a guy like that hit a three that's been -- he works his tail off. It's great to see. It's rewarding. He performed really well yesterday guarding, and then obviously I just thought that three was a big momentum shift."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's the hardest thing in any sport, but especially basketball. Playing limited minutes, going back and forth, limited shots, it's not easy. It can be mentally really difficult."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"The strongest people, they prevail, and they come up when they're needed most."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He just gets his work in. He's been able to stay level-headed through the ups and downs, and it's been great to see. He's hit really big shots, and he hit three last night. But just his work. He works on his shot all the time. It's been good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,The job ain't finished. We ain't celebrating like we won a championship yet. We've still got one more to do. We weren't really talking about anything but getting it done.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,He's really himself. He's like authentic to himself. We all appreciate that. Like he's not trying to be somebody he's not.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"So I think that's kind of like the sicko side of it. He's different, but we respect that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Then the basketball genius, you can learn a lot from him as to how he sees the offensive side of things, the play calling, the game management, all that. He's elite in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I've personally learned a lot from him, and I think our whole group has."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"The first one, I think our analytics department does a tremendous job. Dave Sparks and the gang is a conduit to that on the coaching staff. We have a ton of conversations about what makes sense from an analytical perspective and how do you constantly find small ways to give yourself the best chance to win, but also increase your chances of winning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"In our department, that just makes the most sense to us. Gives us the best chance to win and allows us to control the variables of the game, especially when teams don't have a timeout, which they didn't last night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"So it's a credit to them, just bringing constant trends within the game that I feel like give us an advantage and increase winning any chance you can go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's a little bit, one percent better, save a half a point, save a point, save .9 of a point, it makes a big difference over time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"Second one, I think just having an understanding from a player, just looking at the lens from a player's perspective. I think sometimes when you become a coach you look at it from a coach's perspective, but at the end of the day the world revolves around the guys and how they view things and the lens with which they look at things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"So you have to alter your communication. You have to alter your schedule. You have to alter things that put the players in the best possible decision to succeed. So a lot of the decisions that I make, it's like, what would I have wanted as a player. We have a ton of former players on staff that are able to help with that, so I think that's the biggest thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,I would hope he does not feel undervalued by us because I think he has done a lot of tremendous things as a player and as a person.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"So no, I think he's one of the ultimate values. I think to have a guy like him be able to dominate the intangibles of the game on both ends of the floor is amazing to us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"We wouldn't be in this position without any of our guys, and he's included in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the thing you just can't take for granted in the game today is a coach's greatest gift is a group of guys that want to be coached, want to be led, that also empower themselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think at the end of the day, just appreciate the fact that we have an environment where learning and coaching is important, and getting better and developing is important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"You can't be a good coach if your players don't let you -- you can't be an effective coach. Everything starts with them, their ability to buy in, their ability to execute the things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"As a staff, we're grateful. We talk about it every day. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be here. So it's on them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"The first question is part of life, like any situation you're in is going to help you for the next situation. So we should be able to take everything that we learned as a team, as an organization, last year, this year, so every experience should help you prepare for that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"As far as blocking out the noise, at the end of the day we're the most vulnerable in this. So we have to remain that. We have to remain with a sense of urgency. We have to have an understanding of our environment. We have to know that we're just as vulnerable as anybody else in this situation, and how we handle that will determine our fate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, not at all. I think coaching is understanding that you can't win without the players. I don't care. I just want to win. I want to do it with good people, and we have an opportunity to do that. There's four rounds left in this fight, and however long it takes, whatever it takes, we'll see how it goes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"No. No, I think that's a rather passive way to look at things. I think at the end of the day, we have to continue to do what we do. Kristaps has gotten better from yesterday to today. He's fighting like hell to play. But it's going to be up to us to protect him and to make sure that it's in the best interest for him as a player and as a person."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,Going into what's best for a player and a person has nothing to do with where we're at from a basketball standpoint.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, saying that diminishes the other great locker rooms that you've been in. I think everybody in that locker room would say they've been a part of other good locker rooms."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think a lot of it has to do with timing, but I think at the end of the day we're in a situation right now where everybody is on the same page, that winning is the most important thing, and that we're going to do whatever it takes for however long it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"We just have to remain in that mindset that it's everybody's responsibility to impact winning. As long as we stay there, we have an opportunity, we've got a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,So I think it's focusing on that is what you've got to be grateful for.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,Just building retention and learning how to understand the why and building an awareness to your environment. You can't make decisions and eliminate emotion if you don't have the facts and you don't have an understanding of your environment and what's going on.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just really trying to put yourself in a situation -- how can we get away from the emotion of your environment and how can you get to the tactical, the facts, the truth of what's going on so that you can adjust accordingly."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"It comes down to just being mature about it. You're in a very high-intensity, very high emotional state in this environment, playing in the Finals. Got a lot of people looking at you, a lot of eyes on you. But all you've got to do is just tune that out, focus on what you can control, how much energy you put in, how much effort you're going to put in, how much you're talking, how much you care about the situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"I kind of forget how big the nation really is. Hearing people from Washington, from Florida, Maine, California, affecting lives, affecting people who I've never met, who I've never laid eyes on. It just makes you kind of walk with a certain light."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding the mistakes that we've made. Understanding what we did, understanding what we need to do in those moments and just understanding what each and every one of us are thinking. We can't all be on different pages when we're on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"We've got to understand. We've got to be one. We've got to understand what each and every one of us is thinking, what we're trying to achieve, what we're trying to do in each possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"It was a lot of film. It was a lot of recognition. It was a lot of just talking, understanding we're trying to be on the same page. This is our first NBA Finals for a lot of us, and it's just making sure that we are together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's going to be the whole world looking at you, the whole world talking bad on us, no matter where you look, no matter if it's on your phone, billboards or just talking to someone down the street. It's just trying to be able to understand that we've all got each other's backs. We're all learning from one another. We're learning from the situation, and we're trying to become better people and better players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding where you are. We're down 3-0. But just because we're down 3-0, it's not finished. It's only going to come down to us putting all we can on the floor. Our heart, our soul. Just trying to come out and win little battles because that's what's going to get us the game, winning the 5050 balls, winning the rebounding game, winning the transition game and then just trying to stop them from what they're trying to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"We're trying to make them play into our game, but we're trying to understand what our game is because we're not on the same page."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, we can't sit here and be like, the ref did this, the ref did that. We can't control that. What we can control is the positions that we're putting ourselves in to get those fouls, understanding that if we're talking and we're getting mad at the referees, they're going to end up -- they're going to get the last laugh."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERECK LIVELY II,"We've got to be able to just be mature, be able to move on from whatever play, whatever call they're going to make on the floor because we're not able to control that. What we're able to do is focus on our reaction to those calls."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, overall I think in sports when it comes to competing you always have to believe in yourself, and that's what we do, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"Even before the Playoffs, I think a lot of people didn't believe we could be here. We stayed together as a team at any time. Obviously, it's not ideal. It's not where we wanted to be, but this is also a great learning process for everybody involved."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"But overall in sports you keep competing no matter what, so you just approach it in the right way. Our backs are against the wall, obviously, being down 3-0, but we still have to continue to just play hard and believe in ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think our fans have been great all season long, but obviously yesterday, especially when we had the early run at the beginning of the game. They were loud, and then when we made the comeback from 20 points, they always supported us. They're always here for us, and obviously we wanted to take advantage of the home court yesterday. So that's something we have to do tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"No, I love everybody on this team, coaching staff, everybody around the Mavs organization. I've been here for a long time now. I don't truly have a comparison to other teams, but I know it's hard to top the character guys that we have here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"Obviously, I still have pain. It's not just gone now. But you make the best of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"We have practices. We analyze tape. We try to see what we have to do better, obviously, and then outside of that, just try to get my mind off a little bit, try to relax and then come back and focus my mind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"I wouldn't necessarily say easier, but obviously when your back is against the wall, you can play a little bit more loose and just go out there and fight. You have nothing to lose."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"But overall I think the pressure remains the same at all times. You just want to win as a team no matter what. It doesn't matter if it's 0-0, whatever. We just still got to continue focusing on what we have to do, and also when we watch tape and analyze what we did, learn from it, also for future purposes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"Well, that's a result of how the game goes. I think we just have to create better spacing for Luka and Kyrie to operate and get the right guys involved, and that will also give us better percentages."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,MAXI KLEBER,"Also, Boston is playing a little bit different in this series than they have before, a lot of switching, stuff like that. But it's good for us to just analyze and keep improving on what we want to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"I thought Exum did great. We probably looked back at it, we could have probably got him in there a little bit more, but we went with the other guys. We were looking for someone to be able to knock down an open shot. We had good looks that just didn't go down for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"I thought Exum's pace, his ability to get the ball into the paint for those three minutes was good. So hopefully we can get him in the game in Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think we played 11 yesterday. Everybody is on deck. Everybody has to be ready to play. No lineup changes here today. But we'll see what tomorrow brings."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think the history is there for us to learn from, when you look at great players and the struggles. You look at MJ and the struggles that he had against Detroit. You look at some Magic Johnson struggles. You look at LeBron's first time around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"It's there to learn from. But as the great ones, they use that going into the next season or the next couple seasons to try to get back there because now they understand experience is a big thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,I think you talk about playing Game 4. That's it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"I thought yesterday we got off to a really good start, and hopefully we can do that again tomorrow. You look at the end of quarters, the end of the first in Game 2 and also here in Game 3, we have to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"Again, just taking one possession at a time, controlling what you can control, your effort and energy, and just winning the minutes when you're out there. That's all we've talked about today, and that's what we'll talk about tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"I think Luka is doing -- in this playoff series, when you talk about from the Clippers to today, his defense has improved. But when you look at being involved in every pick-and-roll, there's going to be mistakes that take place. That's just the game of basketball. We've just got to limit those mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"But he is involved in every possession. That's what the Celtics are very good at doing, is making sure when they go hunting, they get the guy that they want. And so for us, we've got to do a better job of protecting Luka."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,It was just film.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JASON KIDD,"Both offense and defense. The good things that we did, and then also the things that we've got to improve on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,It was just watching film. We got to see our mistakes and broke it down a little bit for us so we can get ready for Game 4.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"Defensively we had a couple breakdowns, and offensively I thought we let it slip away a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"Refs are going to do what they are. You can't change that. You've got to play the game the way you've got to play it, no matter what they call."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"Get a win. I guess that's everybody's goal, is to get a win. That's my mindset. That's everybody's mindset. I'm pretty sure you're going to see a lot of smiles out here right now. We want to get this win. That's what we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"We believe in each other. We never stop believing in each other. That's just how we are. We trust each other. We've been through a lot. We've been down 30, come back, take a 10-point lead and possibly have lost that game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"But we've been through a lot. We've fought as a team, and we're going to keep fighting as a team no matter what."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"Absolutely not. These are my guys. I've been telling everybody in the media how much I love it here, and my guys is the main reason. They told me to be me. They pushed me to be me. They don't judge me for nothing. They love me for who I am, and I love it here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"The ones that are fathers, the father figures that I have on the team, they've helped me out because I'm still 27, I'm still young. I have my kids. Just seeing them being around their kids and being able to see how they interact with their kids and their families, it helps me out a lot, especially because previous teams I've been on haven't had as many fathers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DERRICK JONES JR,"I've been on a few young teams. It's just nice being able to be outside the court, spending time with my guys and having our kids around each other all the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question. Try to be simple. I think life is an incredible gift that we can't take for granted. If you've ever lost somebody close to you, that'll remind you really quick how precious life is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"I've had to deal with a ton of loss in my life, just watching people that I love kind of leave this earth, and that was difficult to deal with as a young person. And then getting older and trying to deal with the perspective of being a celebrity or famous person or professional basketball player, whatever it is, an entertainer, whatever we're called, and trying to find purpose in that and why am I here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"So just I think all in all, just learned how to not put so much pressure on myself, put things in perspective, and understand that I'm not alone. I'm still a young person in this world trying to figure it out, and I'm not supposed to have it all figured out. I think that's the beauty, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Just embracing the moments that I get to share with the people that care about me unconditionally, get to know some new people in this world, go from strangers to friends. I get to know my kids, most importantly, and who I want to become for them and my wife and being a husband."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just appreciating the gifts that I've had to earn and work for and built. That's what helps me put all this in perspective, just the past few years of learning how to deal with real human emotions and not gloss over them and pretend like life is all good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"That's it. Just being real with myself. Looking in the mirror and being real. If you can be honest with yourself, then the world is your canvas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, very special to watch from afar, but also as a competitor, as a hooper, to be experiencing it at this level, it's an incredible teacher for me. I use it as a moment to learn how hard it is to win, especially against a great team that's going to guard you the way that they're guarding us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"The frustration is natural, just because you want to make every shot when you're in the Finals. You don't want to miss. You don't want to not play well. You give partial credit to them, but also there's a focus and a preparation you have to have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"These guys on that Boston squad know my game, as well. They know it well. So they've been able to scheme for me for the past few years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"So getting over this hump is something that's been on my mind for a while, watching them, just like everyone has been watching Boston the whole entire year, be the best team in the league. We obviously knew we would have our challenges, but this is what helps us grow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Going out there and competing with the best of the best, competing with Jrue and Jaylen and JT and seeing their ability to cover up some of their mistakes or trust each other to make the right plays on the defensive end has shown me what I have to continue to work on and also learn to how to think the game in a better way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm going against the best of the best, and this is what I've always dreamt of. Whether we win or lose, it's the growth that I look at and how I can continue to be a better leader for my teammates."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,It's been great because we're learning about each other in these moments and what we're made of and what we have to do to be great at this level.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of first-timers on this stage. I've said it over the past week or so, just it's a new space for me, too, just being with these guys and being tested at this level, being challenged at this level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"My first Finals, although I was injured, I lost. You know, 2016, although we like to bring it up, was one of the toughest series you'll probably ever see in basketball in general."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't know if those records are just going to be so easy for someone just to look at and be like, yeah, we're able to do it, too. But that belief that you can win a series and win it together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"But yeah, my message to him is he's not alone in this. He's played as best as he can despite the circumstances, just injuries and stuff. He's been giving it his all. It's not all on him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Being under the microscope in this business is a lot different for me now than probably four years ago, five years ago, because I'm able to put the big picture of life in perspective and also the game in perspective. It comes easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Then also I think the social media, sociopathic behavior. You know, your inner voice is not clear anymore when you're downloading other voices and other opinions. That can become hard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Any little thing that you give your energy to can be a distraction that doesn't positively reinforce what you're trying to accomplish.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,So I think we're learning that about each other right now from not only us as players but the coaching staff and everybody that's been part of this journey thus far. No one picked us to be in this position. No one anticipated us to be here.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"There may be a few people in this crowd right here that had an idea, but we've pretty much broken the mold of what we're capable of doing, and I think we're trending in the right direction."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"We have some positives going on. It obviously sucks horrendously that we're not at least competitive in this series right now three games in, but it's also about getting the experience and learning through these things and also learning more about yourself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"I've taken the brunt of the responsibility because these guys in this locker room, it is their first time. So being in this position, I do feel like a lot of it is on me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"A lot of my teammates would say, no, it's not just you, which I appreciate, but this is also part of my journey, and the story doesn't end here, win or loss."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm just appreciative that we can get another chance to extend our season tomorrow and just leave it all out there. It's all about a pride thing now, and just putting our best foot forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Oh, man. Yeah. Man, I haven't even given that much thought, to be honest with you. This has been the longest season I've played in awhile. It's been six years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,So I'm looking at the big picture in a way that I probably was not ready to look at in my early 20s or late 20s.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"The way technology is today, the way I take care of my body every day and the way I have the opportunity to learn more about my body as I get into my 30s, I'm appreciating."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"My mind continues to get sharper. My physical tools are obviously naturally going to deteriorate, which I can appreciate, too. So adding new skill sets or adding new nuances to my game where I can be successful at this level, especially going against a more athletic league or a faster league, and you've got me over here speaking like I'm 38 already."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"But at 32 right now, I just feel like the sky's the limit. I have an opportunity to be on a special team that can be one of the teams that dominates in this era. That's what I've been trying to figure out the past few years, of how to be on a great team, be in an organization where I'm trusted, and also we're able to succeed and fail together, and doing it in a way where we still have each other's backs, and no one is giving up on the dream or the goal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Our goal is still to win a championship. That's been No. 1. For me, that's why I play basketball every year is just to be able to continue to get better but also to compete for championships."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"If I'm not doing that at 33 or 34 or 35, then we probably can revisit this. But I think right now, I feel like we're trending in the right direction, and especially this organization led by Nico and J-Kidd and our new ownership group. They have a lot of trust in us, which I appreciate, which makes my decision making on what my future looks like a lot easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think just looking back at that first year of both of them playing together Jayson's rookie year, just remember two very extremely talented guys that right away had an impact on the team that year after losing Gordon, and those guys just taking up on the challenge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"I feel like that year we started the season, we lost the first two and then we won like 15, 16 straight, and they were a big part of that. So right away, I just saw the potential there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"To be at this point right now, this is what we expected. I know it doesn't always work that way. But once you get to know those two guys, the type of people that they are, their drive, they want to be great, and I just -- I saw this for them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"I mean, since then, there's been a lot. They came in trying to figure things out, and just offensively they've grown, defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"But more to me, it's been the leadership, being more vocal with our group, also understanding that there's more than just playing basketball. There's a whole other element, preparation, consistency. That's where I've seen their growth. That's paying big dividends for them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think it's pretty easy because what we're focusing on is on our day-to-day, and today we had a good film session before coming here. We're going to practice right after this. It's really just focusing on the work."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,We've continued to do this. We've been doing this all season. This is just the point of the season that we're at.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,We're not allowing ourselves to think ahead. We're just trying to lock in on what we have to do. The job is not done yet.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"So I don't really -- I guess I've heard it before. But basketball is a team sport. It's a team sport. When you are fortunate enough to play for the Boston Celtics, you quickly realize that it's more than just the team that you're representing and the things that you're trying to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"For me, being in this opportunity, I give the glory to the Lord because he's put me in this position, and for me, I know that it's more than me. We have a lot of fans. We have a lot of people. They have been waiting for this opportunity, for these moments. We've been through a lot of adversity as a team these past few years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,"To be at the cusp of doing this, it's something special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,I would say the turnovers. To have no turnovers is always a good thing. That means that we're getting some good possessions and not giving the other team the ball.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's seeing the success of the team. I think you see how we celebrate each other. Somebody gets a big dunk or a big three, when somebody gets a big stop, that really brings energy not only to me but I feel like to everybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Day before Game 4, up 3-0, I feel like we celebrate each other. Even through the downs, we do our best to pick each other up. I think we've done that as a team and will continue to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, that we lock in the best we can, that we do the best to really go out there and execute the game plan and try to get stops. That really gives us the best chance to win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nerves, for sure. You feel like the close-out game is the hardest game to win. You really just want to go out there and do your best, if it's make the right plays, if it's knock down shots, execute the game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You feel like of everything in the season, this is the game you've got to do it. I feel like we'll have that same kind of mentality to where we try to come out relaxed, not too excited, but execute the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,It's the final game of the season.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't ask her, but we've had conversations. Just watching games or even while I watched her play soccer. I would ask her certain things about how she felt, why she played the way she played or whatever it was."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think for the most part, having just an understanding and having a partner that helps me kind of get calm in situations that can help me be in position to win on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is I don't think any of us care about it. I think we all really want to win that Larry O'Brien Trophy. Whatever accolades come with that come with it, but I think the big picture is what everybody is focused on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not even a little bit. I got two brothers in the league, so if I'm really going to be chippy or something, why wouldn't I be chippy with them? Everybody in Milwaukee, I have love for them. I love them because of what we've been through and what we accomplished as a team. We became very, very close."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But no, I know that this is a business, and they feel like they did what was best for their organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's exciting. We're in a great spot, but we're really just focused on the next game and taking it day by day. The job is not done yet, so still a lot of work to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's important. It's really important. You've got to stay disciplined, got to stay in your routines, got to be good in practice. Then all that together leads into the game and execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,We're just trying to be as disciplined and as consistent as possible.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"I mean, Al is just a true professional. He's one of the best teammates I've ever had. He's seen a lot in this league. He's a guy you can lean on for advice. He's seen everything you can see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"But really want to get this one for him. It's like the one thing that he just hasn't been able to get yet in his career, and it'll be pretty special if we can do it for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he's always poking his head in. I'd say he's pretty in tune with what's going on. He's at every practice. I'm sure he's talking to the coaches, giving advice every now and then."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"He's just a good guy to have around. He provides good advice, and obviously another guy who's been through a lot and seen a lot of things in this league. It's good to have him around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he gave me a chance in this league. I was undrafted. I didn't really know what was going to come on draft night, and he called me and gave me a shot with a two-way, and I just tried to make the most of it. Obviously I got converted up to the big leagues."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,It's hard to thank him enough for giving me a chance.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's good. I think he has a unique relationship with everybody. I think he's good at finding one or two things to talk about with each guy on a daily basis that's just to keep the humanity in this professional world."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"He's a great human. He really truly cares about you as a person first more so than as a player, which is awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he deserves a lot of credit for it. He constantly keeps us in check, tries to keep us right where we need to be, not too high, not too low, but right in the sweet spot. He's done a great job of that this year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,SAM HAUSER,"Obviously we have a great lead in this series, but like I said before, the job is not done, and he's definitely kept us in check knowing that we still have a lot to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,My dad is here. It was great to have him here supporting. It's great.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It feels fine. You've got to be able to express your feelings. It's amazing just to be here, be a part of something that a lot of guys never really been able to play in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,Just embracing it and try and do the best we can.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think it's difficult playing against everybody in general. But specifically Boston, 1 through 5, they all can guard. Even when you're trying to find weaknesses in their defense, they always come back or they always have a back line of defense that helped that guy out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"They don't really do a great job of just playing individual defense. They do a great job playing team defense, which goes a long way and which everybody can see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think the biggest adjustment will be being able to build on that fourth quarter that we had yesterday. Played desperate, played well. Everybody was defending, keeping their man in front of them, contesting every shot, and rebounding, making sure they didn't get any offensive rebounds."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"If we can build off on that moving forward, I think we give ourselves a great opportunity."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I mean, Al has been the same way since we've been in Atlanta. Always solid. Always solid, never doing too much, never getting out of sync, keeping everybody together, an anchor on defense, talking on defense, which gives the guards amazing confidence to guard their man, knowing that he's in that back line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"Just him being able to make it this far and be in this position, very, very happy to see him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It's part of their defense. Like I said, it's not an individual defense, it's a team defense, and they take pride in it. They're one of the best at it, if not the best at it. It's not really him on an island picking up Luka and Ky. He has a really solid back line behind him making sure he's confident out there in front of those guys. Yeah, that's probably the reason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,It was good. I think it's important to be able to look at what we didn't do right and learn from that and just make sure we're ready.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"I just think there's been certain things that we've done continuously in games that we probably should have made adjustments on. But overall we always watch film and it's always an open discussion. And I think that's what's cool with Coach, is he sees both sides of us and is able to talk it out with the players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"When you're in the game, I'm not really studying every single foul he commits. At the end of the day it's --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"It's unfortunate. It's a hard position to be put into. But at the end of the day, he's doing it for a reason, and it's because he wants to win the game. He's a competitive guy, so I'm not holding my head a certain way. I know he wants to win, and he's a very competitive leader, and he's the leader of our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, it's obviously challenging. The refs are -- as frustrating as they can be sometimes, they're also the same as us, they have emotions, they change the way -- the same way players get frustrated, they can get frustrated."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"But obviously I think it can change the game a little bit, but I think that's what's helped our team is when we've been at our best, we don't let it hurt us. We kind of use it, use that energy and shift it to us. We kind of let certain things change the way the game goes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"It can be challenging for players for sure, but I really back our group, and we have a group of guys that I know I'll go to battle with all the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"No matter what the energy is, I always feel like we can always turn it around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,Leave it all out on the floor. That's what we need to do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they're a big three-point team. That's one of their biggest focuses. They're a great shooting team. I mean, it's just part of the game, and it's like, you're saying from like a defensive point of view --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"I think our team, we've done great defensively, and I think we do have a great defensive team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously they've hit some tough shots, but overall I think we have played good defense. But going into the game, it's hard to say limit them to a certain number, but obviously we want to limit them to under whatever their averages were."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"And obviously we know they're a big three-point team, and just like us, we're a big corner three-point team, and they've done a good job of taking that away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,Mindset going into Game 4 is win. Feelings right now is to be better than the last.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was tough because we fought our way back, so we fought so hard to get all the way back. The guys that were out there on the floor, they gave it all they got. A lot of guys that came back to the locker room after the game was exhausted. Just seeing how hard they fought, it was just tough to see how the outcome was for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"But it's motivation going into the next game, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmmm... I would say it's a little bit of both. But I would say we stay motivated and we just focus on the next game at hand, the most important game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just shows how desperate we were playing. It was something that I saw when it came to just like guys coming into the timeout. It was just a lot of motivation. Everybody was pulling each other in, trying to stay encouraged. Didn't matter what was going on, didn't matter how the fans were."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It didn't matter what was going on just like on the outside, everything on the inside is what was all falling into place together, in my opinion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"From everything that I seen, everybody was lifting each other up. D Live, he was one of the most vocal guys out there with Kyrie. Whenever Luka went down after his sixth foul, everybody pulled together, just tried to make one final push. The vibe around the team was just leave it all out there on the floor. Whatever happens in the end happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,We just have to find ways to just implement that 20-2 run to just like our game plan in general from start to finish.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,I can't really just pinpoint on why it doesn't happen at the beginning of the games. For sure it's an adjustment that we can make to be able to come out and do it in the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,It's real encouraging. We want to be able to just survive and advance. It's the last series of the season. Don't nobody want to ever be in this position.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,But we just have to really just take our time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, yeah, for sure. We always want to help the main two guys when it comes to just scoring. Defensively I feel like we're doing our job. It just comes all down to just defense wins games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,DANIEL GAFFORD,"We just have to, like I said, just stay motivated when it comes to certain parts of the game. Not trying to force everything, just kind of like letting the game come to us in certain areas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, first, I think I just look at how long the guys have been in the paint, the low man. If it's time -- if it's like two seconds, he's going to go out. I think that's the moment to attack. Then I just try to read the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"If he comes, there's going to be a lob open to the corner. If he doesn't, I just try to take the layup."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, yeah. At some point, yeah. I just really want to win. Sometimes I don't show it the right way, but at the end of the day, I really want to win. I've got to do a better job showing it a different way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,Go back to playing fun. We talk about how we come back from 20 points in the fourth quarter in the Finals. We were having fun. We were defending. We were running. Our pace was great. Just taking good shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"Just got to go away, because at the end of the day refs are going to have the last word. So just got to go away from that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"I didn't really study the first Finals of some people. Obviously, they were great players. Obviously, there's the story of MJ against Detroit. That was a big thing. I think he just learned from it. It's a great experience. You've got to go through lows first to go on top. I think that's great experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"Just like we did before. I always talk in the regular season, there was a time we were at our very low. I think we lost five, six in a row, and from there we just went up. I think we went 17-2 to get in the Playoffs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"I know that's the regular season, but it was the kind of point we all came together, and the chemistry from there went to the top. We've just got to believe. We talk about it in the locker room. I know we can do it, and we're going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they have great players. Basically, all five players that are on the floor, they can really score. They can shoot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"Our strategy was just trying to make them drive more and then be on the wheel, on the rotations. I think I have to do a better job on that, just keeping in front."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"Oh, definitely, a lot of holes, I think, still. I'm 25. I've got a lot of things to learn. This is my first NBA Finals, so I'm going to learn from it, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"But we're not in the offseason yet. They've still got to win one more game. Like I said, we're going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,LUKA DONCIC,"Just keeping the team together. Like I said, we have great guys. We all know what we came here to do. Obviously, we're going against the best team in the NBA, but we're going to believe. It's a first for us, but we're going to believe, and that's our motivation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, last year, just falling short on your home floor, it definitely hurt. It was embarrassing, in my opinion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like the team was relying on me. JT got hurt in Game 7 and I dropped the ball. To me, it was embarrassing. It drove me all summer, drove me crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,I've never been a complainer to the refs. I don't think I've ever had a history -- I don't even know most of the refs by name.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"I do think having a relationship and talking to them to know what you're kind of seeing can have a benefit. But at this point, I think it's a distraction. You go out there and you play the game, and you take it out of the referees' hands."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Joe has been great. Just being in this position last year, just being in the interim role was tough. Even though we weren't making any excuses, but him inheriting that position, it was a little bit more of uncertainty about what we were doing going forward. It wasn't necessarily his staff."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"Now I feel like he's gotten his feet under him a little bit more, even the start of this year. He's been excellent. He's been organized. He seems like he's been a lot more comfortable, and it's showed in our team. Joe's mentality is fantastic. Even today, one of my favorite quotes he said today, he was like, there's no such thing as a foul in a war. Either you survive or you don't. Just that resonates with me because I like stuff like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's really just all mentality, mentally just your will, your focus, your perseverance, your ability to overcome self. I think that's what I worked on the most."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"In moments of embarrassment, in moments of coming up short, falling short is where the most growth takes place. Last year to end the season the way we did, I really attacked the summer."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. You spend so much time and you go through so many things, the ups, the downs, the highs and the lows, and it creates that. Those memories are memories that we're going to forever have together. So those are things that you're always going to carry with you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"To be able to be in this moment, to potentially seal our first championship, I think that's awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"Damn, that's a good question. My love for the game has definitely changed and evolved. There's been ups and downs, for sure. But one thing that I've always loved is the ability to have a platform and to be able to be a role model for others."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JAYLEN BROWN,"There's younger kids watching, maybe watching this interview right now, that maybe aspire to get to the Finals or the NBA or to just be the best versions of themselves. It's going to be a journey. Just know when those moments of adversity come, just never let nothing break your spirit, because I didn't, and I won't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that top to bottom, we trust everybody, and we just compete at a high level. Obviously they are great players, and it's a challenge but just consistently being in the right position and just competing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"Jrue is literally everywhere. It's unreal. I don't know how he does it. Try to learn as much as I can from him, and he's just -- just when you think you've got an opening, like he's just -- he's unreal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a guy that just wants to learn. Some of the drills he does is just a little unconventional, I think, but like just wants to learn and wants to grow. And then every year he's been in the league, he's gotten so much better. That's just a credit to his mindset and the work he puts in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"So being his teammate has been a lot of fun. I've learned so much from him, and he just continues to push me and the rest of us to continue to improve and want to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, Joe is consistent the whole time. I mean, he's probably so happy that it happened like that so he can just continue to tell us that laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"But he just stays consistent. He just makes the right calls, and we just trust him completely. So, yeah, it seemed pretty true today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"He's a sicko, so probably. Laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"Sam has been doing it all year. He gets attacked nearly every time he checks into the game, and we've just got a lot of faith and confidence in him. He just does what he needs to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"But big shout out to X. To not be in the rotation but to stay locked in and he gives us big-time minutes, plus nine, and he just does a little bit of everything out there. Then he guarded his ass off and hit a big shot and rebounds, and he just did a little bit of everything for us. Credit to him. Great, great teammate, great guy, and he was big for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, obviously the strength of this team is the team. But we understand that JB and JT, they are our guys, and they are going to make big plays and they are going to make the right play. I think that's the most important part is just we trust them to make the right play every time down the court, and they are facing literally every coverage known to man. They just make the right play no matter what time is on the clock, and we just trust them so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think experience always helps. We have a lot of guys that have been in close games and big games, and so I just don't think we panic probably as much as we have in the past. We just try to stay calm and do what we need to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, who knows if we would have lost these games in the past, but we just know we've got so many different ways to win games and trust that we can find the answer and just do whatever it takes to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"It's big time. He just stays right here, competes on the defensive end like always. And offensively he can take nine shots, he can take one shot. Like he doesn't care. And just does whatever it takes for us to win. So just having him on the team is just a big blessing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think just we had some turnovers, which allowed them to get out in transition. And just a couple of things that we've been doing really well, we kind of just let go of the rope for however many minutes that was. It seemed like, what, two minutes, they cut it to two, three or something."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"It happened quick, and we just settled back down. Understand it's a game of runs, and we just trust what we do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,Obviously the closer you are to winning that's his go-to. That was obviously said.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"But just understand that we need to play better. The close-out games are never easy, and close-out games in the Finals is probably ten-times of that. So learn a lot from what we did well, what we need to do and just understand we're going to have to play even better for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,Big-time. Big-time shots. Just a guy that he wanted the ball and was able to get to his spot and rise up and knock it down.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"He makes tough shots, and he's just a special player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"Demanded, whoa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"I think Joe is a basketball genius. So whatever he says, I'm going to try to just do it to my highest capabilities."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, we just try to make the right basketball play every time down the court, whether that's a three, but just trying to have the right spacing and just make the right basketball play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERRICK WHITE,"It's not like we need to take however many threes. I think we just can win in so many different ways, and with our spacing and guys that can shoot on the court, we can just do so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"Just you know showing the emotions of the game. Two guys that was excited, tired, that you know, after the game, we just -- we're not necessarily saying like one more or anything like that. We are just saying, however long it takes. Nobody is relaxed. Nobody is satisfied. Just at that moment, you know, just told him I was proud of him and he said the same thing that we've got to keep fighting. We can't relax. And that was basically the conversation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"Honestly, not too difficult from the standpoint of last year we were down 0-3 in the Conference Finals, and we really felt like we were going to come back. We almost did. You know, we were a sprained ankle away from having like a real shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"So, you know, we are not relaxing or anything like that. You know, not even focusing on winning or Friday or whatever. However long it takes, that's our motto. However long it takes, that's what it's going to take, and nobody is not trying to relax at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"That's a great question. I would say that life is about roller coasters, right. The game of basketball and life and whatever your occupation is, right, we all go through ups and downs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"In the toughest moments, that's when your true character comes out and essentially being the same person all the time, that's what I try to do, in the best of times and in the worst of times. That's what I'm going to try to instill in him. You've got to be the same person. You've got to be a stand-up guy through thick and thin."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, they came out swinging. That was to be expected. They were at home, and their crowd was behind them. This is obviously a big game. So we expected their first punch. You know, it's just in that moment that Jrue kind of brought us together and just clapped his hands like, Yo, we got to wake up, we got to lock in. We got to get some stops. Because at that point, they had like 25 points. In the last five, six minutes, we held them to like five or six points."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"But to start the quarter, we weren't getting any stops. You know, we are not going to win a game like that. We just have to reset and lock back in at that moment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"Not really trying to look too much into it. The game of basketball is about runs, and this is at the highest level. You know, it's the best team in the West at this point. They are going to make shots. They are going to go on a run, and it's just all about how do you respond."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, we talk about it all the time. 20-point leads, none that have is ever safe. It's never time to relax. You never want to give up a 20-point lead. Obviously we wish we would have got some better shots, took care of the ball. But things happen. It's never going to go how you expect it, and we talk about that all the time. But if you want to be a champion, you have to be resilient in those moments, and we showed that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"Joe does a great job of showing us clips and things from different sports, right. He's a big UFC fan. And you know, showing us fights of people that -- I don't know like the terminology of UFC, but put them in a chokehold and s--- like they about to tap out. You just see the guy or the woman who is winning relaxing because they feel like they are about to win, and then, you know, you give the other person life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"Just trying to translate that to the game of basketball that, you know, the closer you are to winning, the closer they are to surviving. Basically just trying to remind us in the group that we've still got a long way to go. We still have to play the right way. We've still got to win. They are not going to quit, and we should expect the best from them from here on out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"You just alluded to it that we've been in that situation. We've been in a close game where we were up, and we almost went up 3-1, and then they tied it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"And experience is the best teacher. We learned from our mistakes. We learned from a team at the time that was better than us, that had been there and been over that hump and mentally tougher at the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"We've grown from that, we really have. It was on display tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I've got to watch the film, but that was excellent basketball we played to start the third, especially on the offensive end. I don't know how many possessions in a row that we got a great shot. We made most of them. We might have missed a few."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"But the way that we started the third quarter was incredible. You know, everybody else on that court, the mindset we came out to start the third in our execution, we did a hell of a job in the start of the third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't know if it's at cut and dry as we need to shoot a lot of threes, but with the group that we have and playing to our strengths, being able to beat guys off the dribble, and the luxury that we have is, you know, with our starting five, whether it's KP or Al, everybody can space the floor and shoot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"So it just puts their 5-man in a tough position. 5-men are known to usually help at the rim. But if we have guys that can attack you off the dribble and get all the way to the rim, you want to help. But we've got 40 percent three-point shooters all around the paint."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYSON TATUM,"So it's just all about making the right reads. We're never like, we need to shoot 40 threes a night. But if we play to our strength and space how we're supposed to, it just finds the right person, and we don't turn down any great shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, it's tough to lose him. Obviously praying for Karen, Jonnie, Ryan, the rest of their family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"My junior year in college, wasn't living up to anyone's standards. I got a call. It's Jerry. A lot of expletives, but he basically told me I was an F-up and had the opportunity to be great at something. Just let me have it for like 10, 15 minutes. I thought it was one of the most impactful phone calls that I had really in my life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Stayed at his house once and overslept for UCLA open gym. Went down for breakfast and got another ass chewing because I wasn't being competitive enough.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"The thing I remember about him is he had a tough way of showing that he loved you, but he was super, super competitive and he really, really cared about you. He showed it in a way that kind of spoke to my language."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,He'll be missed and praying for the family.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, just day to day. Just the medical team and the staff just decided that it wasn't what's best for him to go tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, obviously you saw in the first two games his rim protection, his ability to space the floor. But I think the thing that prepared us this year is our depth. It just looks different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"The guys ready to step in can do different things and have a positive impact, which they've done. So we just have to rely on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, it's tough. I've appreciated just his approach. Throughout the whole Playoffs, like I said, he's never missed any meeting, he's always been out there, done everything he can to play. Sometimes it's an unfortunate situation. It's nothing that he can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Definitely feel for him, but appreciate kind of where he's at. I trust that he'll do everything he can to get ready for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"KP, you're not playing. He didn't look right. That was it. I wasn't involved in it. Like you said, it was out of his hands, up to the medical team. They watched him kind of go through some testing and they said it didn't feel right, so you're not playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Get ready for tomorrow and hopefully the next day.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"A little bit everywhere. When you're not that good, they just throw you around in a bunch of different places to see where you stick."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"A lot of stuff. I think just the beauty of the game, the flow of the game. I think it's different. Soccer is much different than the game of basketball. A basketball star is only defined by scoring."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Soccer, you really have to pay attention to the game to recognize the impact each individual player is doing, because points are at a premium. Each guy in the right position has a direct impact on the guy in the next position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So greatness, you have to pay attention and look for it, whereas in basketball you can look at a stat sheet and say, oh, it must've been this guy that have played really well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So really the depths to which you have to go to understand the greatness and the complexity, the beauty and the connectivity that goes into playing the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,I wasn't out there. I have no idea.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's the same steady messaging. Also you want to give them the best preparation you can as far as what the sub pattern might be and what the ifthen scenarios will be. So you go over a couple of those with them, but for the most part it's the work those guys have been doing with them leading up to this point and conversations with their individual coaches, which have gone very well. I just trust the work they put in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the questions have allowed me to fight that. I don't think I've gone out of my way to do it. You guys have asked really good questions based on that. I've been able to take the question you guys ask and give my perspective on it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think at the end of the day, it's about our team and it's about putting the guys in the best possible position to succeed and have an understanding that our guys are going out there and doing everything they can as a team, and why that's so important to long-term success. I think that's what we're trying to achieve as an organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"It doesn't happen unless the players decide to do it, and they're doing it. You can't let that go unnoticed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Like if you've ever been in a fight with someone and you think you're about to beat 'em, you usually get sucker punched. The closer you are to beating them up, the closer you are to losing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Closer you think you're going to submit someone, is usually when you get submitted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"There's a lot of them. Usually every single fight. I think it was UFC 302, guy gets hits in the nuts, complains to the ref, complains to the referee, gets distracted, he gets choked out the next round. He lost his focus."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"You see Alex Pereira, gets hits in the nuts, looks at the referee, knocks the guy out five seconds later."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,So it's the approach to what happens to you and how you handle it. But the closer you think you are to beating someone is the closer you are to getting your ass kicked.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Tonight I expect the best out of Dallas, and we got to get ready for a fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, you were going to expect a run from them because they had a 19-point quarter. And just by the type of shots they take alone, you knew they were going to make some kind of run. Some of those came at the expense of our offense. I thought we missed a couple reads that changed coverages and they changed matchups on like three or four straight possessions and we missed the read to get the right shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I would say probably 60 percent of the shots that we took in that stretch we have to get better, and 40 percent I was okay with. We just missed them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Our one-shot defense and our ability to get back to the game plan, they put a ton of pressure on your defensive game plan throughout, and you've just got to stick with the discipline of it. So we were able to do that and make plays down the stretch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Nothing. Our first half points per shot was 1.23. So I thought we getting really good looks. They just weren't falling. You just have to stick with it over the course of the entire game. I thought in the third quarter, we found the right spacing and frequency, and we made the right reads six times and that got us those shots and they were able to fall."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's where the second stretch of that fourth quarter, we missed some of those reads, and they were able to come back into the game. Those guys' ability to know that what shots they were taking, and continue to take the right ones over and over again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"He played in the Western Conference for three or four years, and so he's played against the Mavs. And so he's had that experience. Memphis has used a similar game plan, so he was used to that. I thought with that comfort level of playing against those guys for so long, he was going to be able to execute the things that we needed to execute."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so I thought he did a great job in our switching and did a great job in our screening, getting into our spacing. And that's what we talk about with those guys, is regardless of who is in, who is out, I trust the next man up because of the work they put in and the staff that prepares them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, we got asked that question a lot because it was new. Anytime you're developing a new philosophy or a new style, it just takes time for understanding and execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So credit to the guys where we decided how we are going to play, and we fight to do that. You know, but also just being flexible in that. So we don't want to just settle for those. I think our guys have done a good job fighting for the right shot based on what the defense was giving us. We were able to get some of those in the third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think it says a lot about them. The guys understand the game. They understand why we do what we do, and they work to execute it as best as they can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,I would say both teams have a lot of talent. So I think you have to have talent to get to this spot. That's a given if you want to make it this far.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"But our guys have a great basketball IQ and have a great understanding of are we playing the right way, taking the right shots and giving up the right shot. They know exactly when we are not doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So they have an innate ability to control the runs of the game with the philosophy that we have and execute the things. And so it's just constant building awareness, are we getting the right shots, are we giving up the right shots and are we winning the transitions. The guys do a great job of working towards understanding that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just what we talked about. Having an understanding of like we know teams are going to make runs can we manage those. And we know why we make runs, and we know why other teams make a run on us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So you just have to constantly problem solve throughout the game. You have to ask yourself why every single possession, why did that happen? Why did this happen? Was this what we talked about? Was it not? And the guys, they fight for that because of their basketball I"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"They spend a lot of time understanding that. And that's part of the game. They got out to a big lead, and I forgot what we were down, 13? So that's just part of the game. But it's understanding why. Why are we down 13? Is it effort? Is it execution? Is it things we can control? And once we answer those questions, we can move on to the next phase of the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, how can I explain Jaylen? The guy just has a growth mindset. He just wants to get better. He yearns to get better. He's not afraid to face his weaknesses on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So when you have that type of mindset, you're just going to be able to take on every situation that the game brings you. He puts himself in every single situation that he sees in a game. He uses six, seven, eight coaches a day, and every situation on both ends of the floor, he puts himself in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't think he gets worn down. He looks pretty fresh out there. I think we could do a better be job of being intentional in the offense with the spacing at times, but I don't see him getting tired at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"We were trying to play fast, create advantages and create indecision. But we didn't create any indecision. When you miss the first read, it's not a lack of execution from the guys. It's not a lack of like trying to execute. It's if you miss the first read and you miss the first window, it's really hard to get that window back against a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so, you know, that's what we were able to do in the third quarter. We found the first read, bang, right there, and we got it like six, seven, eight times in a row. If you miss that first one, it's a nightmare to get a second and third one, and that's when you end up taking a couple shots you don't want to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"It wasn't because they weren't trying to. We just missed it. They do a good job of changing up matchups and changing spacing and fluctuating it. So there's about eight possessions where we will definitely watch. But we have to do a better job of seeing the first read and when we don't, we have to find the second one faster."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just stick to the things that we've been doing. I mean, have an understanding. We were down 13. I expected that. We were down one at the half, and I expected that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,You have to expect the expected. You've got to understand we are just as vulnerable if not more vulnerable than they are. And we have to play that way.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"So as long as we have that mindset, and when you understand that you're vulnerable and your back's against the wall, you've got to fight. And so that's the mindset that we have to have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Again, it's all about taking the right shots. It's all about taking what the defense gives you. They are playing a unique defense against us because they are one of the best teams in the league at protecting the rim, and they have two great rim protectors. So if you try to become stubborn, you put yourself in a disadvantaged situation at the other end of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Our defense starts with our offense. And so if we don't take the right shot, we can't guard them. And our team has the discipline to fight for the spacing and to fight to take the right shot, whatever that shot may be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"Derrick has a green light to shoot the shots because his skill set is taking the shots that make sense. He can get into the paint and shoot the two-foot floater off there, he can shoot off the dribble threes, and he can shoot catch-and-shoot threes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"I love the fact that he continues to play. His confidence never wavers based on the shots he takes, and you can always count on him to make the big ones."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"We just got to make history. We got to go out there and we just got to play like our lives on the line. We got to make sure we're not giving up corner threes. The game plan is allowing them to get to the rim, allow them to take pull-up twos."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"So we're going to keep learning to do that, but we got to be able to rotate well, talk, communicate, know where the pass is going to go, know where we need to be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"We all know what it takes. We all know we got to put everything in our minds, our body and our soul into this game. We're watching film, we're talking to one another, we're trying to figure out what we need to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"They're a great team, so you got to give them that. They know how to score. They've been doing this for a long time. We just got to be able to step up, learn and be able to adapt."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"It really comes down to us just taking our foot off the gas. There were times in the game we allowed them to be comfortable, allowed them to walk into threes. That's what they're going to do. They're going to make the shots that they get, we're going to give them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,We just can't take our foot off the gas. There were times in I'd say the third quarter and end of the second that we just allowed them to go on runs. We allowed them to be comfortable. We can't allow that to happen.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"We have to be up in their grill the entire game, and not let our foot off the gas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"Next-man-up mentality. No matter if I foul out, Luka or Ky. It's the next-man-up mentality. No matter who is on the floor, what's going on in the game, we're all putting our heart and soul into trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like we did an amazing job throughout the whole game. Even when we slipped up, we were staying together, staying positive, doing whatever we could to try to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,We just got to be able to take care of the little things. The little details is what is going to cost us the game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,I didn't think it was a foul. I don't think any of us did. Just you can't take back what the refs call. You can't take back that moment.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"So seeing him foul out, he putting his trust in us, his teammates, as I would do if I fouled out. Just because he fouls out doesn't mean we're all going to look down and be boo-hoo, we lost. We're going to keep our foot on the gas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"We were trying to do whatever we could to try to stay in the game and win. We come up short, but we're going to learn from our mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"Us as bigs, we were trying to make more of an impact than we have the past two games. Trying to duck in, be all over the glass, no matter if it's defensive or offensive, try to go on a run. They were trying to pass off Porzingis' man a lot. Even with that, we were trying to put Al Horford in it, any other elephants, and try to get the mismatches, get the space and get the shots that we like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"He came out, he was the head of the snake. I feel like he was leading us, making sure we had energy, making sure we were talking to each other, staying positive and then setting each other up. He was talking to us, saying what he needs from us, what we need from him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,He's been a great leader. He had a great game today. I know he's going to have another one on Friday.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"He's a great defender. He's been in the league for a while. He understands the game. He understands the schemes, what they're trying to do, what we're trying to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"There were a couple times he got on the ball, he was moving his puppies. Got to tip your hat to that. Just because that happens -- just because you're adding a new person in doesn't mean anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,DERECK LIVELY II,"We were just trying to do what we do. Get out in pace, pass the ball, throw it ahead, get ahead, get to the rim. If not, get corner threes and move the ball around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,That's a good question. There's a lot of them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the adjustment is no different than the Indiana series. They didn't have him. They're used to not having him. The adjustment with Horford or Tillman, someone that they can go to. I think there's not a big adjustment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,They just came out of a series without KP. We look for them to continue. Maybe somebody's minutes goes up.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"For us, understanding what KP does at the rim with the shot blocking or changing shots. So we have to be aggressive when we take the ball and understand their smalls are pretty good at blocking shots, too. We have to account for who is at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"It was just brought to my attention. I didn't even know. Talking to Mike and Doris from ABC, today was Game 6. Just to understand time flies by."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"But it was a surreal moment to be able to win the championship. To do it with that team, with Dirk being our leader, Jason Terry. They were asking, What did you think when the horn went off? I was like, We wanted to keep playing, but there was no one else to play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,I think we're comfortable with P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with Maxi at the five.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Boston has done a great job in the sense of taking the vertical game away and living with the layup. When you look at our quarterbacks, Ky and Luka, getting to the rim, we have to take that and at some point, if we can make enough to see if they can make that change."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"If they don't, we can look at Maxi or P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with that. We've done that during the season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"I did not, unfortunately."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"That's a great question. Everybody. The game of basketball is about communication. For our guys, that's one of the things, as much as communicate, the next step is listen and be able to process what's being said."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"For us as a group, we've been a little bit slower with that. Hopefully we've made that adjustment and can be better with that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"I think talking about the last game, we put ourselves in a position on the road to win. That's all you can ask for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,I haven't talked to Dirk here in the last week. He has FIBA obligations. He has tennis lessons and everything else smiling. He has more important things.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"We'll talk when we're at home and he's here hopefully for Game 3 or 4, just to get some advice of what he sees here as we go forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,But I haven't talked to him since the Minnesota series.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's I think what we talked about after the game, one possession at a time. We'll watch film tomorrow and get ready for Friday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we were trying to find someone to come off the bench and give us a spark. It doesn't always have to be someone making a shot. I thought the guys that played tonight helped us get the lead or get back into the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"They called a foul. I was stuck. I had to challenge it, so ..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Had to challenge because it was a close call. But the referee called it a foul. Got to move on, move forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"We missed some layups. We had some good looks. We missed some layups, some open threes. Again, we miss a three, Ky misses a pullup that we would take every time. It's a one-possession game. Unfortunately, we could just not get over the hump tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he's definitely got a bull's-eye on his chest. He's got to be able to guard and understand that we're there to protect him and help him if he does get beat."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Again, he's carrying a load offensively. They are putting him in every pick-and-roll and iso. He's got to be able to play the game where he can rest on offense and let others carry the load."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"I don't know if it was the Celtics. I think we just got -- we missed some bunnies tonight. Understanding that that's just part of the game, I think with fatigue, mentally and physically. We just missed some layups that we haven't missed here in the Playoffs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,Give them credit they make it tough. They will wear on you as the game goes on. We got off to a good start. But I didn't see where they affected us in the sense of we missed some layups. That's just the game of basketball. It happens.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"I think for us, this is a quick turn, so we don't have time to, like, go to the park or anything. We got to figure out how to score the ball, take care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Again, Brown and Tatum, when you give up 60 points to those guys, we don't have time to go clear our minds. We've got to do better. That's for everybody who's playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it looked -- looks can be deceiving."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think when you look at experience, we're all learning what it means to be on this stage and going through it. There's a lot of young players on our side who have never done this before. Just understand, we'll talk about that, that this experience that we're going through is a healthy thing. It's not a bad thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,We're down 3-0. We felt like Game 2 and Game 3 were better for us. That's the way we have to play. Then offensively we just got to get some other people to step up and make some shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,End of the fourth? I called a couple timeouts.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,That's tough. Why you guys laughing? I asked what timeout was it. I called a couple timeouts. You got to do better.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,"Thank you. We missed the three and we missed Ky's pullup. It's a one-possession game. We exerted lot of energy on the defensive end and the offensive end, so that's why we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JASON KIDD,That's for clarify that. Way to step up.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, they're a good team. They're going to make adjustments. They know how much of our offense over the Playoff run has been predicated on getting easy looks for our bigs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They've been taking it away, putting guards on the bigs, not really helping off of them. A lot of one-on-one defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,It's about us finishing and hopefully that creates some space where we can throw a lob.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I don't think I really had a choice. It was unfortunate that the foul was called. Luka picked up his fifth and sixth in a matter of a three-minute or two-minute span. It's tough."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"We still had to figure out a way to win the basketball game. We put our best foot forward, especially being down 21. We easily could have packed up and folded."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"But we didn't give up. We kept playing. The guys that were out there, we kept competing. Felt like we gave ourselves a chance to win down the stretch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"But when you're going against a good juggernaut offensive team like the Boston Celtics, they're going to make you pay for mistakes. You got to give them credit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, but it was a quick look. I mean, we're in the NBA Finals. I'm not really thinking I've got to tell my guys we still have a chance to win the game, we're only down by three points."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"But yeah, I think probably in that stretch, I definitely could have done a better job of just settling them for what's coming. Jrue was picking me up full court. They knew they were going to pressure me to get the ball out of my hands."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"I just tried to make the right plays, make sure guys were in the right spots, have them understand that we still have a chance to win this basketball game. That was all I was thinking. Just even before Luka fouled out, just the way we started off the fourth quarter, giving up those two baskets where they went up 21."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, we could have folded but we kept playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, I just really think about going home. This is a metaphor here. Just be ready smiling. Just go home, get the ammo ready, get the bazooka, the 50 cal ready. Get everything ready, because when we come into Game 4, we know we got to shoot our shots and we got to do it with an aggression."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"We just got to stay positive. For me personally, again, I'm going home, dusting off the tools and just getting ready for a tough Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time a team has tried to target Luka on the defensive end. So for us, we're just trying to put a great shell defense around not only him, but the rest of the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"It's going to be a great defensive challenge for anybody to guard Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. You have other guys that are playing roles that are pretty much great team roles they fulfilled. Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, they're great offensive players too, but when you have those guys on the backside making decisions, playing high IQ, they're going to make you pay for your mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,Then you got you Derrick White catching the ball by his waist or above his head and still shooting the threes and making timely threes.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, you got to give them credit. Still, we have a belief that we can win one game at a time and take this series a little bit further."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question. I think when you see us out there, there are a lot of shots at the rim that are contested by one person or two people. I think at this point it's more of a pride thing for us to go and finish."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"I definitely wasn't there emotionally or mature-wise. He definitely deserves his flowers. He rallied us tonight. Came to the bench and just told us to keep believing. When you have one of the youngest team on the team, if not the youngest guy on the team speaking like that, one of two choices. We can either follow his lead and continue to ride his energy, or we fold up. I think that we made the former choice, and we kept playing and kept competing. Just wasn't enough."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,But I got to give a big shut out to D Live for keeping us at bay and keeping us at peace. That was special. That was special. Those are moments that you remember forever and you carry on as a team that can help you down the line.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"We just got to convert. I feel like we're getting a lot of shots that we like. When you have Luka going against Payton Pritchard or D White in the post, somebody else in the post, we feel really good about it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,Now isn't the time to hold our head on not converting shots that we normally have made a majority of this playoff run. We just got to keep attacking.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"You just got to let it breathe a little bit. Let the human emotions come out. Just give him a hug. That's it, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"It's easy to point the finger at just him, say, you could be better. That's easy to say. I think he knows that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"But, yeah, it's reiterating that I have his back, we all have his back. It's a tough game. It was a tough call. We could have probably done a little bit something different on his fifth foul just to give us a little bit more of a grace period to set our defense and get him on a matchup."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,But hindsight is 2020. We have to wash our hands of this and get ready for Game 4.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,AL HORFORD,"It felt great. It felt like we played really good basketball. Our defense was really good. Obviously, to withstand that run there in the fourth, that was huge. I felt like we stayed with it. We took their hit and we were able to find a way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we needed to stay poised. We feel like we have been in these positions before and weve learned in the past from it, and I feel like we handled it well. D-White made a big three there late. JB and JT made some big plays, and Jrue defensively was all over the place. We just find a way to get it done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,AL HORFORD,Just continuing to play. Understanding that Kyrie was going to be more aggressive and we had to do a good job guarding him.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,AL HORFORD,"Derrick is special. Derrick is such a special player. Hes a winner. He wants to be in these positions and these moments. Its just unbelievable how he continues to find way to impact the game. Offense, defense, whatever it is, hes doing something to impact winning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,AL HORFORD,"Obviously, I was probably going to play some more. Then we needed somebody from the bench to come in and give us minutes, and Xavier was amazing tonight. His energy, defensively he held his own, time and time again. He was just ready for the moment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,AL HORFORD,"Its not easy being in that position. He came in and he knocks down that big three as well. But defensively he was special. Im just proud of him because he didnt get an opportunity the first two games, obviously, and he has stayed with it, really took advantage of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,AL HORFORD,"These are the type of games people remember forever, the type of impact he had."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It was a great win. You saw how Dallas fought back and I feel like we knew that they would always fight. But I think toward the end of the game you saw our best players in JT and JB just take over the game, make big plays, get big stops and we got the win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I feel like we have been doing it all year. Weve been battle tested. Weve been in situations like this before, up 20, down 15 or whatever it is. Really just stayed together and stayed composed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Cant get too high. There is still one more left. Weve seen crazier things happen. Just get the win. Whatever it takes, however long it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JRUE HOLIDAY,We feel for him. We know that he wants to be out there fighting with us and we want him out there with us. But weve always had the next-man-up mentality and to go out there and win it for him and win it for our team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"It's okay. Every time they draw it, basically call a foul. I try to be better. So got to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, yeah, we had a good chance. We were close. Just didn't get it. I wish I was out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, I don't know. We couldn't play physical. I don't know. I don't want to say nothing. You know, six fouls in the NBA Finals, basically I'm like this motions with palms out. C'mon, man. Better than that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"I think we should have just kept playing with the same energy, keep the same people in. We were rolling down there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"But then they came back. At some point we were down 21, too, in the fourth quarter and we came back. We're still going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"Not really. Never happened to me, I remember."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"Just playing with pace. We played good defense and we played with pace, just driving, kicking. That's how we got back into the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"I think we got to figure out some things. We played three times against them now, so we're getting to know them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,But I think being down 21 in the third game and then coming back was a really positive thing for us.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"Like I said, it's not over till it's over. We just got to believe. Like I always say, it's first to four. We're going to stay together. We lose together, we win together. So we got to stay together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't see what he said. I don't know."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,LUKA DONCIC,"But he was a legend. We all going to miss him. He's the logo, so... He was an amazing player. I wasn't born yet, but I saw some highlights. He was an amazing player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think I've made that play from beginning of the season or before the season even started. I told myself that I wanted to just maximize my defensive potential, and I wanted to make First Team All-Defense going into the season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, that didn't happen, but to be able to be in these moments and show your defensive versatility, picking guys up, guarding guys in the post, guarding contested threes, switching on, it's been big for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But we have a lot of great defenders on this team. So it's been a full team effort, but that's something I definitely took personal going from last year to this year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"No, KP didn't talk to us, but we've been playing all season and all playoffs without KP. So it wasn't any surprise for anybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,Obviously we'd love to have KP out there. We are different when he is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But X stepped in that role, and I thought he was great. Defensively I thought he was stellar, and that big shot he made in the corner, I just knew it. I just knew when I drove, they were going to help, and he was going open. And I trusted it all the way. I just knew it was going in. I don't know how to tell you. It was just like a divine experience. I knew X was going to make that shot, and he did. That was big for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,I thought X was great.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was a great team win. That lead dwindled fast. I know we were up 20, and then they stormed back. And that's what the beauty of basketball is. You can never let up. It's always time, and they were able to cut the lead."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But in those moments, those are the moments which you have to just live for. We've been in those moments a lot. We just needed to be patient, be poised. I feel like we got some good looks. The defensive intensity ramped up. Officiating, you know, got a little bit tighter. So at the end of the day, you've just got to make plays. I thought we got some good looks down the line in the fourth. Some went in. Some didn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But we were able to make plays and find a way to win. And we've been in those positions, and we've lost. It was great to overcome that with my brother, Jayson, and with our team. That was special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Luka is a great player. I'm going to start by saying that. He does a lot for their team. Offensively has the ball in his hands a lot. It's a tough lift for him. He's been tough. Even with that fourth quarter, those stats, he's still been able to pretty much get to whatever he wants."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"So we've just got to continue to be better, and that's all I could really say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, sometimes success can be almost not -- I don't want to say a bad thing, but just being able to finish that quarter where we were up 20. You know, start of the fourth, they came out and made some plays. I checked out around that time, and around that fourth quarter, they just stormed all the way back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, you know, it's like that in basketball. Sometimes when you are winning, comfort kind of sets into your mind. You kind of like relax. Your brain kind of wants to go at ease, and you've got to fight that. You've got to fight that temptation to fall into that because it's still time left to be played and other teams are still competing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"And I think even though that lead dwindled fast, we found ways and moments to overcome it. In that fourth quarter I was proud of, we made some big-time plays. Jrue Holiday, D-White, JT was physical, aggressive. Got to the paint, and we were able to finish it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"To answer your first question, I feel like in the first half, I feel like we had some good looks, some good reads. I was finding guys, getting to the paint, getting up into the offense. I was a little bit -- I was letting them off the hook."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like they were letting me just have open looks from three, and I was taking the first one and I should have been a little more patient. I was a little bit more patient in the second half of letting the game kind of come to me a little bit more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"But it's awesome. I mean, I can't -- I don't even really have words. It kind of doesn't even really feel real right now. I'm just trying to stay in the moment. It feels great to be up 3-0 in the series but the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,Just seeing what the game is giving me and making the right play. I feel like we got a bunch of great looks. Good things happen when I get to the paint. Sometimes I don't always get to assist. Sometimes it's a hockey assist.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,But I just like making the defense converge. You have to respect them getting to the basket. And we have a lot of great shooters. I was committed to that all night.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I feel like in the first half I could have done it more and I settled for some shots because I have like a big on me. You know, I needed to get to the paint a little bit more. And I did that in the second half, and then in the fourth quarter, and I feel like that's what helped us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"The coaching staff has been fantastic all season long. I've been saying that throughout the regular season, even before we got to the playoffs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just it's been just super organized. We've walked through all different types of scenarios. We've been like overly prepared and making sure that we know. Sometimes it's like you've got the coaches, they game plan, but they don't always let you know exactly what they are thinking. Like, they tell us everything. Super transparent. And we trusted it. We trust it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought that's been great. Joe has been a big reason of that, and he showed himself in these playoffs. He's been coaching his ass off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think definitely it's been some growth, but I think this team has trusted me, especially in this playoffs and those moments to just be who I am."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like I've been able to just deliver just by being just being patient and being poised. Those opportunities have presented themselves, and I've been able to take advantage of them. But I give all my credit to my teammates for the trust they had in me to have the ball in my hands and to be able to make those plays."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just being aggressive. You know, running that action with the ball in my hands to finish the third, I wanted to make sure that we got a good quality look."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"So if they would have overhelped, I would have been ready to kick it out. I saw that I had been making those passes in the first half, and they didn't want to give those threes up. So they kind of were in between, and when I seen that, it was lights out. So I just went up and finished it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"Experience is the best teacher. All year long we've been hearing about the Celtics are the past, for the last six to eight months, that's all we've been hearing is all the different shortcomings we've had in the past."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JAYLEN BROWN,"This is a new team, you know what I mean. We've learned from those experiences. And in these moments, you can see that we learned from it. We stepped up to the plate, and we found a way to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, he's a great person, a great player, and he's doing everything he possibly can to help us win and help get back with us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"No, not at all. I mean, he's just a highly competitive person, and he's doing everything he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say his attitude has ever changed, even when he got hurt in Miami, he still was smiling in the locker room after that. His mindset, his attitude has always stayed the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Just means someone is going to have to step up. We trust every single person on this team, and like you said, they've stepped up this whole postseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Whoever we put out there, we understand they might not be what KP is, but they're going to do whatever it takes to help us win games. I have just as much trust in whoever we put out there as I do in KP."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Just trying to make it difficult for him. He's obviously a great player, and just trying to make him take tough shots. We expect him to play better, so it's going to be more of a challenge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"We're just trying to get a good look every time. We don't have a number we need to hit, but just go out there, making the right read, making the right pass, and just getting a good look every time down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, it's how we attack the basket, just get in the paint, crash the defense, try to make the right pass and the right read off of that. I would say that's been our offense the whole year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, every game you can learn from and just understand that it's going to get tougher each and every game. The things we did in Boston might not work this game, so just being able to make the adjustments that we need to and just trust that whatever adjustments they make, we've got an answer for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be crazy in here. We've just got to stick together, and I'm sure we're going to have a lot of Boston fans, too. It'll be fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERRICK WHITE,"Just sprinting back, trying to make a play. I don't really have a fear of getting dunked on, so that's kind of part of it. Then just trusting the instincts. Just trying to sprint back and trying to stop a basket any chance I can. I've just kind of been doing it for a while."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a learned experience. Over time you learn how to deal with all the extra noise and attention, whether it's positive or not so positive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, I'm a fair, smart person. I know when I'm doing things at a high level. I know when I need to do certain things better. So I'm not, like, oblivious to what's going on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"At the same time, just keeping the main thing the main thing and focusing on trying to win the next game. That's what's most important at this time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, that's part of it, right? You never, like, completely shut a guy as talented as him out. You've heard it a million times great players, try to make things difficult, show them different coverages, make them work for everything. They're going to make some shots. They're going to miss some shots. You just don't want it to be easy for them to be comfortable. That's with any talented player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,I'm a big Matthew fan? We went to school together. I actually watched him win last night. Trying to learn and understand the rules in the game of hockey more and more.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I got to watch the game last night. They won. Like I said, I'm extremely happy for him and his family. Hopefully they win it all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I think being in the Finals two years ago has helped me in this moment. Like I said, I understand that I do need to be more efficient. I do need to shoot the ball better, I would not disagree with anybody on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,But I'm not letting it bother me. I'm still trying to find ways to impact the game and dominate the game in other areas.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I understand that it could take one game. One game, I could explode. All the percentages and things like that could change. So it's just that mindset of I'm one game away or whatever that means."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Like I said the other day, I know what it's like to be in this position and lose. This time around, trying to do any and everything possible to have a different outcome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"So, yes, I know I need to shoot the ball better. And I plan on it. Not letting that affect everything else that I need to do on the court to help us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Yes, that's one thing where I truly do appreciate Joe, aside from being I think an excellent coach, is that I truly do believe that he cares about us, our team as individuals, obviously myself, the conversations that we have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"He always, through the season, the summertime, obviously through this postseason, has had days where he's called me, called me into his office. Not necessarily talk about X's and O's, but check on me as a person, how I'm dealing with everything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"That does mean a lot for somebody to take time out of his day to show that compassion or whatever, just know that he's there for me. That relationship between yourself and a coach is important. That's something I truly value about the relationship that me and Joe have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, that's just another thing. I think Joe always challenges, in particular me and J.B., to find different ways to affect the game. I think J.B. has taken that up another notch of his conditioning, his ability to essentially chase down and guard guys, like I said, 90 feet from the basket."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"That's just another way that, obviously, besides his scoring and things like that, that he can positively impact the game that gives us the best chance to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"We're just so much of a better team when we have him. 7-4 unicorn, right? He's as talented as they come. Presents so many matchup problems on the offensive end. Then on the defensive end, somebody that can affect shots, protect the rim as well as he does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"So, yes, we've had success and found ways to win without him. Obviously, we're better when he's on the team, when he's out there playing with us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"Obviously, he's day to day, doing everything he can to get out there and give us whatever he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to put us in the predicament where it's like I'm shooting not as well, still we can win. I want to shoot the ball well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"But I feel I just keep saying it. That's not the only thing that I bring to the table, not being defined by that. Earlier in my career, I was a score the ball and rebound type of guy. How much I've grown and developed as a player, reading the game, understanding what the defense is trying to take away, giving up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYSON TATUM,"It's such a long season that you're not going to make every shot. You're not going to shoot as well as you would like to. The guys that I've studied, the best of the best players, have always just found a way. That's just all I've been trying to do, is find a way to do whatever I can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think that's very good. It's how we come out for Game 3. Got to be the more desperate team. I think if we take care of business and really come out with a purpose, we'll be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,For sure. We're looking forward to it. We like playing on the road. It'll be a good environment to play in.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Definitely.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Well, I didn't go straight to the scorer's table, but I did get Joe's attention or Charles' attention, too, and then they told me get in. I guess you could kind of say I did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"For sure. I think Ive earned that right a little bit to show that I'm able to take those shots, even if they were very difficult. I don't care about my shooting percentage as far as that. I could have been 0 for 9 if I missed that. But that could have been the difference, and who knows from here on out. Maybe that helps me jump start to make the next couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I don't practice them, but I just look at them, and I don't know, I probably zone in more on them. Just like clock is winding down, and you've got nothing to lose."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's special for sure, just the energy the crowd had got us jump started us to start the fourth well. Built momentum. Yeah, those are moments you live for on this type of stage, so that was big time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I probably blacked out a little bit, but like I said, it's just moments that you dream of, of hitting shots like that with the clock winding down. Hopefully I can continue to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Al is in the middle of watching Game of Thrones right now, so a lot of us have seen that. I just re-watched Yellowstone with my fiance and my brother for the third time, so I went through and watched that, also. I love that show."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"What happened? I mean, the tweet that we put out was pretty explanatory. It's kind of a random situation. I felt something, and now I have to deal with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"As we said, yeah, it's going to be day-to-day, and I'll see how I am tomorrow, and obviously I'm going to do everything I can to be out there tomorrow, and we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I am, of course. I have to be. I'm optimistic, and as I said, I will do everything I can to be out there tomorrow. Yeah, we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know. I don't know the specifics. But that's something I'll leave in the medical staff's hands to determine whether I can go or no. But from my side, as I said, nothing is going to stop me unless I'm told I'm not allowed to play. That's the only reason I would not be out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, I don't care. I've been through some stuff in my career, and obviously this is a rough patch coming back and having something happen right away again. It's tough. It's very -- just a tough moment right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,But I'm feeling pretty good. I'm feeling pretty good. Mind is good. We'll see tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know. It was kind of a random situation. It wasn't like I was limping or something I did before this. I was good, and then this happened. I don't think it's anything related, and I don't know, either. The medical staff would know better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,It is what it is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I'm living by those words. Of course."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, I hope not, but if it comes to that to win, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I was going for a rebound at the free throw line. Just kind of pushed in Lively's back and we bumped knees and something happened. I just kept playing for a while after that. Obviously towards the end my movement was affected a bit. Joe took me out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Some black magic, no? No, I'm joking. No, the first time I came back, I was not playing that game, I was with Washington, and I had a warm welcome here. They even did a tribute video, which was very unexpected for me, but that was very nice. I think the organization, the people on the inside appreciated my time here, and that was very nice. Obviously, I have completely no bad feeling about this place. I love this city, love the fans, and it just didn't work out. I definitely don't expect a comeback like I had in New York. But we'll see tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's pretty close. I think because of the type of player that he is, it's always going to look different because of his versatility."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's probably why you asked that question. None of the American ones did. They look at the lens differently of basketball. In America, nothing is ever good enough. It's about what can you do for me right now. It's not always the case in that situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yes, I think we are. I think he's only going to get better. He makes greatness look easy because of his ability to impact the game in many different ways. He's going to continue to get better and better and better. It's an honor to coach him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, listen, he's doing anything and everything he can to be ready for the game tomorrow. It's a serious injury. At the end of the day, our team and the medical team is not going to put him in any bad situations."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,We've taken the decision to play out of his hands because the importance of him. He's going to do everything can he to play. We're going to leave it up to our medical team. That's really it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the growth of him as a player has been, like, not being defined by one thing. When you have your superstar players knowing what it takes to win, they're willing to take that on. Sometimes it's scoring. Sometimes it's defense. Sometimes it's rebounding, passing, executing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I think one of the major growths of Jalen's game is he'll do whatever it takes to win. That could change each game. That could change each series. He's doing that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"What he would say? He would say, Focus on the details, focus on the fundamentals. The closer you are to winning, the easier it is to become distracted by things that you can't control, things that don't matter. Here are the things that matter, and you got to fight like hell to accomplish those things with simplicity, with discipline and mental toughness."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,Everything he talked about was about your mindset and your mental toughness. That's what separates you.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Thank you for asking the second question. I think it's the most important thing. I think the ability to handle the ebbs and flows, the humility to understand there's a plan that's much bigger than who you are individually. Have an impact on other people. Then using the gifts God has given you to try to impact people."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"It's my anchor, the most important thing. I've enjoyed the challenge of trying to stick with that even when it's difficult at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I think he's missed some easy shots. I expect him obviously to be even more aggressive and to fight to get those shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,The most important thing is just being detailed in individual defense. It's not about shutting him down. It's about just making it difficult for him because of his ability to impact plays.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,So we just have to fight for that. He's gotten some good looks. I think we have to guard him better. He's definitely going to be more aggressive. We have to be better at individual defense. We have to be better at our team defense. We have to be better at our details.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the biggest thing is when you get someone and you realize that everything everybody says about them is true, that's probably one of the ultimate compliments you can get. Your character is what it is. It's what you say it is, what other people say it is. I'd say that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Everything everyone said about him when we first got him, it's been even better. Just the type of person that he is. His humility, his competitive nature, the way he treats his family, the way he treats his teammates, how hard he plays, his willingness to do everything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I didn't see it. It is out of his hands. It's his job to fight like hell to put himself in the best possible position to feel as good as he can. We're not going to let him compromise himself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's been it. To say, We need you, do everything you can, but at the end of the day we got your back and make sure we put you in the best position possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I have no idea.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,Criticism is the ultimate beauty. It's a sign of ultimate respect. It's just a beautiful thing. I really love the way Jayson has handled that. It's just a testament to who he is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Shot selection is all about timing. It just depends on the time and score, depends on the spacing, the type of play we ran to get the shot that we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Nobody knows what's a good shot and what's not except the people in our locker room, because those are the ones that we talk about every single day. We know how important shot selection is. I think the greatest strength of our team is they fight to take the right shot every single time down the floor. They know what a right shot is. They know the importance of how the shot will impact your defense. It will impact or offense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"On that particular shot, that was a good shot because we were in offensive rebounding position, the floor was balanced, we had the matchup that we wanted. It allowed us to do both to offensive rebound and get back in transition."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think you just try to learn, try to look at different lenses. I think everybody tries to look at the game the same way. The more you can look at it from a completely different spectrum, it allows you to build connections. It allows you to really focus on where games are really won and lost, and not on the stuff that's easy to notice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think everyone notices the easy things. It's can you fight to notice the things other people aren't, because you know that's where winning and losing is, is in that space."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Try to use different things to keep the guys engaged. It's a long year. If you keep talking to them about game plans, it gets stagnant."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"You try to build connections. You figure out what's one thing that can grab the guys' attention for an extra 10 seconds, something outside of basketball that you think can hammer home a point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"At the end of the day, that's the most important thing, is making sure you get through to your guys so they listen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I try to be like peers with all of our guys. The age gap is relatively there. I try to have a peer-like relationship with all of them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Then with each guy it's different, because you can break down different barriers -- who is married, who has kids, whose faith is important. Sometimes it's not for people. So you connect differently."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I've always had an interesting relationship with Jrue because we share the same app, the Hallow app. Before I met him, he was actually on there. I would listen to his prayers. I got to know his heart. Then I coached him in the All-Star Game. I always had this spiritual connection that we would end up in the same area at some point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I kind of felt like I knew him before I knew him just because of the way he prays, and I knew his heart."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Our relationship now is -- sometimes we talk to each other, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we just give a head nod. Sometimes I see his wife, I give them a hug sees my wife, give them a hug. That's it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"You're talking about football, okay. I just want to see if I got you right. I think Neymar has handled the most pressure lately. But because we had a lack of idols most recently. If you are back in 2002, we had Ronaldo, had Rivaldo. We had a great national team. This talent has gone down for the years. Neymar has surged like a huge talent. We put a lot of expectations on him that he can deliver to us another World Cup. I don't think it's pretty fair to him what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"I agree. I would say the same thing for Tatum. Also, he's the first No. 10 to take on the weight of Brazil since the social media era. Who before Neymar was involved in that social media area? He's so good, everything you can do can be taken for granted. When he won the gold medal by making the game-winning penalty kick, you would have thought that would have solidified it. It hasn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Most recently, yes. I have a particular opinion, but I have to see the general thing about it, about Neymar. I don't agree of a lot of his actions outside the field."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know him. All I know is the soccer player.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,We should just focus on the soccer player. I don't think that's fair.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,"Don't get me into the coaches. I mean, don't get me into the football coaches, right? That's like an impossible job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"It's a lot of pressure. It's a huge country. We love football, we love soccer. It's our sport. We were always good at it. It's a lot of pressure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,JOE MAZZULLA Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,Most recently the results were so bad that the pressure is just rising.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,I study that a lot because I think we're in a similar environment here as to how to handle all of that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Boston Celtics, probably just from the basketball, as great as the national soccer team. Pretty much the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,JOE MAZZULLA Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,I know you love soccer.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,JOE MAZZULLA Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"I know you like Pep Guardiola, and I know you stole some things from his thoughts."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOE MAZZULLA,None of us are that good. We steal from everybody.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"Defend the house. When we went out there, we were trying to do what we could. We couldn't get the two wins, couldn't get a win. All right, cool, move on, next play, next game. Now we've just got to bring a different energy, a different light and a different positivity coming into Game 3."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY ii,"Just really getting out in pace. I feel like whenever they slow us down and we end up playing one-on-one, we can't get into our pick-and-roll game because the defense was pulled in and they're expecting it. But whenever we are out in transition, I set a high screen at half court, and Tatum doesn't know if he's going to step up or Porzingis doesn't know if he's going to step up, that's the game we need to get into. Just being able to move the ball, get out and run and make sure that we're not so stagnant with the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's just understanding the defensive principles. Instead of me protecting the paint, it's me rotating to either wing or rotating to the corner. It's just understanding where you are on the floor, understanding if you see where you need to rotate, it's getting there. There was one time Jaylen Brown cut, I was supposed to rotate corner. I thought he was there, but he was at the rim. It's just always moving your head, keeping your head on a swivel and understanding where you are and who's in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"They're going to be loud. I honestly didn't think it was that loud. There was a bunch of rumors about how Boston is going to be so loud, so nasty. I thought it was going to be worse. So just knowing that, it just makes you want to go out there and perform in front of your own crowd."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"Come out there, punch them in the mouth. I feel like we were doing a great job of guarding them, a great job of just going shot for shot with them the majority of the game. A lot of the game just came down to us not being as sound on the defensive end in the fourth quarter, us making free throws and us being able to take care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like whenever you're in games like this, you find out who you really are. You understand what you really want out of this, who you really are, just understanding that whenever you're on the bench, you're here, your teammates just lock into the game. There's nothing else going on in the world that can take your focus away from what's going on in the Finals. There's no other feeling you want to be in and no other place you want to be in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, it's kind of hard to make sure I don't slip up and say anything too inappropriate. But I'm just out there trying to make sure my people hear me. Everybody on the team knows that if I'm mic'd up, making sure you don't say anything too crazy to me. But they know I'm going to talk to them on the defensive side, talk to them on the offensive side, and even if they fall down, I'm picking them back up and giving them positive words of encouragement."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, I feel like they keep coming back to me because they like what they're getting, so I'm going to continue to put on a show, continue to do what I do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just continue to be aggressive. Try to win each possession. Try to win the little battles -- the rebounding game, the diving on the floor, the loose balls, all the little things are going to come down to a win. It's not just the big shots. It's not just the big plays. It's the little plays that are going to give us the boost to give us the extra steps that we need so we can get a breath of fresh air."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,Maxi Kleber,"Like any other time, you have to make sure you stay composed. Its a long series and you want to make sure you play the right way and play your game and dont get affected by outside noise."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"I think its not about any individual person. I think its overall on the offensive side, creating the space so Kyrie and Luka have it a little easier to create shots for themselves and for us. So we just have to make sure we have the right spacing and putting guys in position to succeed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, but even if not, Ky makes great decisions for us. Even if he has an off shooting night or whatever, it doesnt mean that he played bad for us. We know he has a high IQ, but we can give him a little more space to get some easy ones to create a rhythm."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"Its the Finals and you try to take away a lot of things. You contest every shot and make it harder on both sides for both teams. If we have the right spacing and involve the right guys, we can get the shots that we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,MAXI KLEBER,"We have to take the energy from all the fans and bring it to the court. Come out with the right attitude and get the win. If youre at home, you have to take advantage of it, just like Boston did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think he's one of the best players in the world. You're trying to just make it tough. That's all you can do, is hopefully guard the first move, guard the second move, guard the third move and contest. Guys are doing that at a high rate, trying to make it tough on him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought Exum did a great job in Game 2. We'll look to see if we can get that combination out there a little bit more as a third ball handler. Defensively, I thought he did a really good job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,He's one of the few that has made a three in this series. He knocked down the open three. We're going to need that a little bit more from him.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,I thought the pace he came with was really good.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their defense, just understanding -- I thought Luka did a great job of getting off to a great start scoring. It's just understanding who's on and who he's involving in the pick-and-roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"We have to do a little bit better job of that. Again, he's getting where he wants to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"That's what they say. We're home. Understanding that Boston held serve, that's what we're talking about, is just focusing on Game 3. We felt in Game 2 we had opportunities we just let get away from us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"For us at home, protecting home court. But the cliche is role players play better at home, so we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"It's easy, just say relax. I think the urgency started for us awhile back. I think we're used to that. I think the game of basketball is about makes and misses and capitalizing on mistakes. We just haven't had that opportunity to capitalize. We're getting stops. We're turning the ball over, give up a three. Understand coming down the stretch we had to play perfect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Hopefully the game is close coming down the stretch and we can capitalize on their mistakes. But there's two teams playing, so we can relax and enjoy this and have fun. That's what it's all about. Hopefully we can do that tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"You look at White and Holiday are comfortable -- Holiday is very comfortable in the dunker. He plays as the big. Being able to not just put the ball in the basket, but also to be a playmaker from that position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"He's a willing passer. When you talk about a point guard or a versatile guard, those two can playmake from there. So they put a lot of pressure. It's a little different when you have smalls in the dunker."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"For us, we had to do a little bit better job of understanding who is down there. Again, Boston is a very talented team when you talk about the four around one. They have four shooters on the perimeter. They can playmake. They're very willing passers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"Sometimes in this league you've got to give up something. Right now, they're taking advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"This is an incredible atmosphere. To win that championship in 2011, the city is incredible. They love their Mavs. To win it then and now to be here in '24 is special because you don't really get an opportunity to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JASON KIDD,"I understand the opportunity that I have to be the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. It's a dream come true. But we're trying right now to figure out how to win one game, and that's the next one tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,I've been saying it all year failure is the best teacher at times. It can inspire you to do great things.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"It's our first time being in the Finals as a team with this group. We understand who we're up against, the competitive level, the nature of the Finals, the competitive level we have to play at. Also, the adjustments that we have to make out there on the floor just as players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"The coaching staff is doing a great job of preparing us. But it's our job as players to make those adjustments and play even harder, especially when the game is getting a little out of balance, we have a lead and we want to extend it a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"A lot of it is just a learning curve for myself, for my teammates, and also a peace of mind that we give each other that we want to give ourselves a chance by leaving it all out there on the floor, playing our best, preparing the best way we can. That's literally been the focus since Game 2 ended, was putting our best foot forward, coming back home, feeling familiar, letting our game speak for itself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"First thing of that is just accepting that I haven't played well or up to my standards, as well as I would have liked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Being back in Boston, there's such a level of desire that I have inside of me to play well. Wanted to be there for my teammates. As a competitor, it's frustrating. But I don't want to let that seep in or spill over to any other decisions I have to make there as a player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Continue to feed my teammates' confidence. Have been down 0-2 before -- lost a series, won a series. I know what it takes. Also how to prepare for something, like, that mentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"First is just respecting your opponent, then most importantly putting your best foot forward out there when we go out there. It's as simple as that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"He's been playing great. He's been one of the emotional leaders on the team. Defensively he's making it difficult. That's what he's been doing all year. For the past few years, he's tried to make his mark on that end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I can be a lot more fundamentally sound, technical on my shots, not get into the paint often where it's three or four guys around me, I'm not making a pass. They're sending specific strategies against me to make it difficult."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,We're at the highest stage in the world. It's a small sample size. We only get a seven-game series potentially. I just can feel the stakes being raised up a little bit more. The pressure is natural. Makes diamonds.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"For us as a team, we just have to control what we can control on that end. Being able to match their pace, but also feel good about ourselves when we get stops. When we get stops, get out in transition, we're a better team. When we're getting stops and giving up offensive rebounds or we're getting stops and turning the ball over, it hurts our chances to even be in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"The margin of their victories hasn't really displayed the full story in terms of the Celtics beating us. We just have to continue to lean in on each other, especially when it gets tough out there. We're going against a great team. They're not going to stop pressing us, stop their pace, stop testing us on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"We know what we're in for. But now we have to raise it to an even higher level, and it starts with me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,Sharing with them that it took a lot of resilience. It took a lot of will to win in 2016. That's also a different team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"We had time to fail together. We had time to go through our trials together. We lost in 2015. A lot of guys came back in 2016 and we won. So there was an inner motivation there. We also knew who we were going against, how well they played."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I think if you have a healthy way or perspective of looking at where we are now, it feels like we are that team that's gaining the experience, that's being able to fail at this level. Now we have an opportunity to respond. That's all you can ask for in a basketball season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"If you asked me in September or October, would I want a chance to be down 0-2 and having a chance to respond in Game 3 or be out of the Playoffs, I think I would choose the former. It's as simple as that in terms of putting it in perspective."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,We're the only teams left. This is about chess. That's all it is.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think it starts with just being aware of your own goals, what you want to accomplish, your team goals, how you can help accomplish that. Also what's going to bring you peace of mind off the court when you leave it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Some of us would say family, video games, other business entrepreneurial opportunities. Just helping you have a healthy balance with the game. The game is going to be a game. It's going to torment you emotionally. You're going to fail, succeed, make shots, miss shots. You want to be able to go home to a great family, people that love you unconditionally, those that are going to be truthful with you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm grateful I've been able to build a tribe around me that has all those. Dealing with a lot of the criticism, when you're young, even when you're older, how to accomplish something like I'm trying to do right now, there's going to be a lot of people that want to see you fail. Get used to that too. There are going to be a lot of people that are going to be naysaying, want to see you kind of destroy yourself in the process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I would say just focus on the people that really love you for you. Your teammates are there to support you, especially when you know them throughout. Then trusting the people that have been there before you. They'll give you a lot of advice to help you reason or rationalize what's going on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question, brother. It took me awhile to figure that out and find that peace of mind. That's why you get a chance to see me up there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I definitely want to see you accomplish that peace of mind a lot earlier than I had to. It's not worth it to let anybody's opinions get to the best of you. Or people that have never been in our position don't know what it takes, don't know the sacrifices, never will, but they guess, and they try to make it up. Show them respect, but at the same time understand that we're all human at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it started with me just telling my hermano I got to play better for him, alongside him. In order for us to accomplish our goal, we both have to be playing well and we both have to be doing the little things, doing whatever it takes to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Easy conversation. But it started with me reaching out, just letting him know it's my fault, taking accountability for not playing particularly well. But also I got to continue to trust my guys around us or around me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I need to have fun in the process. We've gotten this far because we've been a great team, not because we've just put it on me and Luka. It's been a total team, organizational effort to get this far. We just got to keep trusting in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,Pretty simple conversation.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,Rather win smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, we definitely have had some moments of positivity on the defensive end where we've gotten the missed shots. Again, I just remember one play that comes to mind, where potentially we could be down six. Pritchard hits a three going into the fourth quarter where it gives a little bit more breathing room to have the game in their hands."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Just being aware of some of the plays that they're going to try to make at the end of quarters, the plays they make at the start of the game to get them going a little bit, the plays they run when we're in the lead. We've had the lead in the first quarter -- 12-6, 13-6 both times. We're feeling good about ourselves, and they come out and run the same play four times in a row."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"Our IQ has to be at a higher level. Also, our communication and trust has to be at an ultimate level where we can just trust our instincts out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,I just know hes going to do everything he can to get on the floor. Hoping for the best.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,Lets see. Well see how everything goes. Just have to wait and see if he is going to play or not. I feel like we have plenty of guys who should be able to come in and help contribute. We just have to wait.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,"He feels pretty good. From what Ive seen, he seems pretty optimistic. For him, were just wishing that he is going to do everything he can to get himself going. Anything that he can give us, well appreciate it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,AL HORFORD,"For us, its just continuing to do what weve been doing all year. Being consistent on the defensive end. On offense, playing the way we want to play. Just being consistent. Our team has been this all season. Now we have a great opportunity in Game 3 to come in here. We understand its not going to be easy. Its going to be a tough game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Trying to be the hungrier team. We're going to go out there and try and execute a game plan, and I think most of us just try and do it together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP is tough. Whatever decision he makes is his decision. But he's a tough guy. Obviously whatever decision he makes, I'm supportive of it. But that's mostly up to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP always has a great attitude. That's something you don't have to worry about. He's just like this joy and this light. Anytime he walks into a room, no matter what's going on, he brings that every time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's team defense. We do it as a team. It's not just one person, it's everybody. We just try to defend him, we try to show him bodies, multiple people, and just try to make it difficult."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think we still have spacers. I think we try to do our best to get into the right spacing or get into the right positions and try to do as best we can.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's hard. I've sacrificed a lot. I've missed out on a lot of my kids' stuff just to be here. But the journey is cool, and I think just the friends and the family that I've met along the way has made it worth it, and the fact that my family is here with me makes it even more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You've got to talk to him. I can only imagine. It would be tough, right? Missing a lot of the Playoffs and then coming to the Finals and then getting hurt at the end, it would be hard. But KP is a tough guy, and he knows himself very, very well. Again, like I said, he's been bringing this energy and this positivity that he's just always brought, this light, and he'll continue to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,I think that's been here. I think that trust has been here. That chemistry has been here. We just embodied it from the beginning. That wasn't anything that had to grow over time. That just came naturally.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's not any different. I did it in Milwaukee, too. I'm not really sure people actually knew that but there's a lot of time being in the dunker and trying to space the floor and have the best spacing, but I think for this team, me down there trying to make plays out of the dunker a lot of the time helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Getting the ball to JT and JB. The way they've been playing, the way they've been touching the paint and getting to the basket has been huge for us, and one of the reasons why we had such a good game last game. Again, I think JT driving and attracting two or three people and collapsing the defense has made our offense a lot easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,All I know is that he is working his butt off to try to be ready to go for tomorrow. Thats really all I know.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,"I think that is the beauty of our team. Were friends off the court as well as on the court. Not every team youre on is like that. Every guy gets along with each other. Dach guy individually has his own personality, but it all kind of works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,"He obviously poses a lot of different threats for us and the other team. Wed love to have him out there, but if he cant go, everybody just has to step up. Weve shown we can do it throughout the Playoffs when hes not there to play, but obviously were really hoping he can play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,SAM HAUSER,We just have to be laser focused. I think the biggest challenge is being on the road. Dealing with the fans. Players are usually more comfortable on their home court. We just have to come out and be ready to go.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,Its a must-win for us. We need to come out aggressive and deliver the first punch and make sure were ready to go as a team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"As far as adjustments, I think we need to be a lot better at just overall. Offensively, weve been awful. We know we need to be better. We know what we need to do. Its just about us doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah. The guys are definitely excited to come back to Dallas. Weve been on the road now for a week. Coming home and getting the energy from the crowd, I think its only going to help us. I think were really looking forward to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"I think every single game in every single playoff series is a must-win. But I think for this, we have to win this game. Thats the intent going into this game its a must-win game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"Coach has been good because obviously he has been in this position before and knows what its like as a player, too. Obviously, he has had his message and hes been able to get that across to the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"In saying that, he has also done a great job of being able to hear the players opinions and how we feel like we can fix things. So I think its been a mixture of both. But obviously I think it comes down to aggression and just having trust and confidence in one another."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"We need to make them. Its obviously frustrating not making them, but at the same time, we need to make sure were taking every opportunity, even if we are missing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"At the end of the day, its going to get better. Were not going to keep missing. Its been a big emphasis. Weve been shooting a lot, getting extra reps in. We know what were capable of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JOSH GREEN,"Weve been shooting great throughout the Playoffs. I think its an adjustment. A little bit of jitters in the first game. Its one of those things now, its do or die. We need to make those shots. Thats just how it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, it feels great just to be back on the home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much with me, just the same as coming out from the last game setting the tone physically. Just come out with energy, match everything that they're throwing at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"The only thing I would say they're probably doing differently is just 1 through 5, switching on every screen-and-roll. But we've found ways to get around that. Of course we want to get a lob every now and then, but we can find other options on the floor besides lobs. It's always good because we have a lot more weapons in our arsenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,Just have patience. Not necessarily letting them speed us up and then find the loopholes when it comes to their defense.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like everything matters when it comes to just like being in the Finals in general. Free throws are big, like you said. Making more shots, of course. But like I said, just stay patient with the game, let stuff come to us and not let us get sped up when it comes to what we want on the floor offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"It's a blessing to be in a situation like this, coming from the situation that I was in. Just that next step in my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like a segment of some stint of the last game, we found ways to be able to do that. We have to make them take the shots that we want. Once we get to that point and we can do it consistently, I feel like that's when we can make them uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just believe in him. Find ways to get him downhill. At the end of the day, just try to keep him as motivated as possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, it's been a minute, in all honesty, just to have a post-up play for me, for sure, so it is new to me. Most definitely it's just something that me, J-Kidd, anybody else on the team that has seen it, if we see anybody down there when it comes to like a mismatch, I always throw it down there and we can just play out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, for sure. The whole team is helping me. Everybody is having fun because at the end of the day it's the NBA Finals. There are going to be challenges. There's going to be obstacles. There's going to be adversity. We find ways to get through that as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like it's going to be the same. I always loved just coming here and playing with the home crowd involved. I heard it's a sold-out game tomorrow, so hopefully it's going to blow the roof off, most definitely. They should hear us on the other side of Texas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think that the biggest thing is we know they're going to collapse when we drive, so I think the biggest thing for me and what we've talked about is playing off two feet, whether that's a lay-up, going aggressive, or knowing that they're going to collapse and finding open shots. That's the biggest thing going into this game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I'm a guy that no matter the situation in any game, I'm always going to try and put up that shot. Like it happened that other game, I think it was an important basket for them, kind of cut the momentum a little bit going into the quarter. But yeah, I think a lot of the times it's shots that we practice a little bit, and I think we're good enough players to make it. He obviously got lucky on that one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"I've hit a few. I've hit a few. Mine are mostly deep, past half court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"No, actually last year, I actually kind of went through a thing with one of my teammates about kind of a process of what I would do to shoot, and I think he was kind of a launch type, and I'm a shoot. I'll stop off two and kind of shoot and aim it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"But I think credit to Live and Gafford they're playing in a role where they have to defend out on the perimeter, but as much as we can get them back to the basket, we will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"No, I think they have enough guys talking to them. I think it's a lot of process. We've been watching a lot of film and making sure. But I'm confident in their ability."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"No, I think some people get lost in the emotion of everything, and yeah, you have to kind of remind guys to, hey, I'm mic'd up. But I think it's just the moment and everything. Even mic'd up or not, I think guys, we're going to say what we want to say. But I'm always pretty calm, so I won't say too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"First, I feel good. I don't want to get in any more details. But I feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I think it's up a notch, for sure. Both teams played a lot of games throughout the season. But I think the physicality has been on point, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I would say it's different. Just being 18 and 25 is a big difference. But it's different games. Here, you play first to four. In the EuroLeague, it's just one game. It's way different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,I wouldn't just say that game prepared me for now. It's throughout my career that prepared me for these moments.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I saw him before when I started driving. I saw him at that spot. So when I went for the layup, I saw him, I knew he was going to be open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"Very helpful. He can dribble the ball. He can play point guard. He can help us both. Save our energy. He can just bring the ball up. He can make plays, too. It's good that he was able to play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, our defense built in five guys. Our low man is very important. So no matter who is the low man, we know we going to do a great job. We've worked on this the whole season, preseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,I've been in that position a lot with the low man. We've been working on it since preseason. We feel confident with that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"Just one thing Keep shooting. We all believe in those shots. That's how we came to the Finals. That's how we played the whole season. We believe in those guys. Everybody believes. If you're open, just keep shooting. You're going to knock it down at some point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,Just trying to keep getting open looks. I think our defense has not been bad. We can't really score. That's our main problem right now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,LUKA DONCIC,"But I think we getting some great looks. Like I say, we have confidence everybody can make a shot shooting the ball on our team. We just got to keep believing in it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"You could say that. I like to pride myself that I always try to play with that fire and that passion. I feel like that's what makes me who I am, the essence of why I play and how I play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"But my experiences, the heartbreaks, the losses, have all kind of cultivated into what you see now. I don't want to feel that again. I think that's fair to say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's been fun. Personally, I think it's been necessary. I think anytime you want to achieve something great, it's going to take a little bit of sacrifice from every individual to get to where you want to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Me going into this season, I knew that being one of the leaders, that would be in front of me on my plate. I didn't mind it. It's translated to us being here in the Finals. The sacrifice is necessary not just in sports but in life, if you want to achieve a goal, to some degree."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"For me, it's different for every individual, but it's almost like you got to trick your mind almost in a sense. You almost got to play like you're down 0-2 rather than up. That's hard to do. You got to go into that mind frame, that focus. Now we are playing like that, rather than you let comfort, you let some of those things kind of seep in. You just try to stay focused and try to harness the mind as much as you can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"The mind is a powerful thing. It's hard to grasp some of those things as you are intaking them. If you can kind of focus your mind on what you want it to focus on, you'd be surprised what you can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Gotten to know Jrue a lot. Jrue is, like I described it in the beginning of the season, he's like an assassin. He just has a will and a might about him, how he plays, that he'll die on the battlefield. I'm the same. You recognize that and you respect that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"His will is unbreakable. He's going to show up. He's going to be there. He's going to be in the fight with you. I've been against him on the other side, so you could feel it. You could feel like this dude's not going anywhere."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's where the respect for me and him, just being opponents, but now him being on the same team, it's an honor. It's been an honor to be his teammate because of how he carries himself. His willingness to sacrifice, his willingness to adapt, and then be successful where he's adapting to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"For example, this year was different than last year. He's like mastered being a corner three-point shooter. He wasn't that at any other point in his career. He took the role on this new team and developed into almost a new player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,I don't overlook stuff like that. I think those are forms of greatness. Even though we expect greatness to be these things that are so large or so captivating. Stuff like that doesn't go unnoticed to guys like me. It's been an honor to be his teammate.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. Team camaraderie, you're going to experience this, it's probably the hardest thing to gain in the NBA. A bunch of guys, a bunch of egos. Agents telling them one thing they feel another way. Having everybody on the same page is probably going to be the hardest thing you're going to be trying to experience throughout your career."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it always starts from the top. Like, you look at the top guys. Me and JT, we've been here the longest, and we set the tone from the jump. Everybody else kind of has to follow along. That's kind of what has worked for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Every locker room, every organization, is a little different. You got to figure out how to get your team into that same vibe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"It's hard enough to get two people on the same page. Trying to get 12 or 15, all the way bought in, there's going to be some challenges."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's where leadership step in. As you develop as a leader, those are the type of things that you learn. You improve, you build relationships with guys, you talk to guys on the court, off the court, they start to trust you. That's how you start to build some of those good habits."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"But it don't happen overnight, I'll tell you that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,"Same old, same old. KP has been tremendous for our group, not just in the Playoffs, but all season long. It's obvious him on the floor just helps elevate us to a different level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,JAYLEN BROWN,But we've been priding ourselves on next-man-up mentality. We prepare for these moments to be able to play with or without anyone. It just requires somebody else on our team to step up and everybody to buy in to get a full team victory.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, just sprinting back, trying to make a play. Obviously they were making a little run there and whatever means necessary, just sprint back and meet him at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think my first three steps is really important. Just kind of put my head down and run. Then at that time just trust the instincts and trust the timing that I have. So, just putting my head down and sprinting just as fast as I can just to get in position and go up and make a play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"That's what Payton Pritchard does. If you watch us late clock, he doesn't shy away from that moment. That was a big-time shot, kind of got us momentum. You just love Payton. You love competing with him. It was a big-time shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"I think a lot of credit just goes to the type of people they are. They have done so much. I can't begin to talk about how thankful and grateful I am for Jrue just kind of allowing me to kind of take that next step. He could easily have came in and be, like, I'm Jrue Holiday, and I'm like, You are Jrue Holiday, a hundred percent laughing. But he kind of just did a little different than what he's done the last few years and just each game getting more comfortable. KP, the same way. Just love being teammates with both of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, the whole year the strength of this team has been one through however many guys we got. We trust whoever goes in the game and those guys just work so hard. Every time anybody checks in the game, they just give us great minutes. So we trust everybody, and everybody is making big plays for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, that's why I got dunked on earlier. But it's part of the game. I think just that not afraid to get dunked on allows me to get some that maybe some other people wouldn't have gotten. So just trying to make a play, just believing in my abilities and what I can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, that experience, that just championship DNA, which you hear all about all the time. You don't really know what it takes until you do what it takes. Just the moment he came to our team in training camp, he kind of just had that presence about him. He just knows how to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are excited to be in Boston for Game 2 of the NBA Finals and to present the 2024 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President Rick Carlisle and all of our great NBA head and assistant coaches, I would like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, Michael Levine, Tim Frank, Paul Benedict, Mark Broussard and the entire NBA for all of the league support and assistance in providing this platform to honor the extraordinary achievements of our great NBA coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"We are especially proud of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who over an outstanding career set the standard for integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion of NBA basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"Chuck was an incredible mentor to so many coaches and players in our league, including Coach Carlisle and Coach Tomjanovich."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DAVID FOGEL,"With that, I would like to turn it over to Coach Carlisle. Thank you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Thanks, David. Adam, thanks again. This is just such a wonderful opportunity each year to honor basketball royalty."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"I first want to thank our selection committee Bernie Bickerstaff, Billy Cunningham, Joe Dumars, Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley, Donnie Walsh and Lenny Wilkens. These eight committee members have been with us through the 16-year history of this. I think this is our 17th year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"The winners of this award over the years, it began here in 2009. The first Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award winner was Tom Heinsohn, who was the guy that originated the Coaches Association back in the early '70s, followed by Jack Ramsay, Tex Winter, Lenny Wilkens, Pat Riley, Bill Fitch, Bernie Bickerstaff, Dick Motta, K.C. Jones, Jerry Sloan, Al Attles, Hubie Brown, Frank Layden, Del Harris, Larry Brown, Mike Fratello, Rick Adelman and, of course, Rudy this year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Of all the recipients that we've had for this award, I don't think we've ever had someone whose profile was so similar to Chuck Daly's himself. Both Rudy and Chuck were back-to-back NBA championship winners. They both were Olympic gold medalist coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Interestingly, Rudy one-upped Chuck a little bit. He has a media cooperation award named after him that was established in 2011. And Rudy told me it used to be the Chuck DalyRudy Tomjanovich Award, and somehow it just shifted and now it's only Rudy. So that's pretty cool."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"But both Chuck and Rudy are guys that were beloved, unconditionally respected within the coaching profession, and guys that were able to get the very, very best out of a wide range of different kind of players and were so great and made so many people feel special and made the players that they coached feel special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"I want to recognize Sam Cassell, who is in the back. Sam was, I think, on both back-to-back teams in Houston. Hit the big shot against New York the first year, I remember that, in the Garden. He'll be coaching tonight. We tried to see if he can come out on the court for us for the award ceremony, but he's got a job to do over there so we can't pry him away. But appreciate you being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy also authored one of the great postgame comments in NBA history. I want to make sure I get this right ""Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"So it gives me great pleasure, great privilege to introduce Rudy Tomjanovich as this year's recipient of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Thank you very much. I want to thank Rick, David and the Coaches Association for this honor, the guys on that selection committee. If you had a poll of my favorite guys, all those coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,The great thing about this award is it came to me out of the blue. I had no idea I was up for this. I happened to be with my son up in Houston when I got the call and Rick started telling me about it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I got emotional. My son kept asking, ""Are you okay? Are you okay?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Then he told me what the award stood for, and finally I hung up, and I told him, ""No, everything's great."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And then I did cry. The reason is, when something like this happens, I'm not thinking about the championships. I'm not thinking about all the good stuff. I'm thinking about the dark days, the days when I doubted myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,That's pressure.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And he said, ""I promise you, I will give you everything I've got."" And he did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Now, a little bit got lost in the translation because he's really country and I'm really city. He would say some words like ""yonder"" and stuff like that. But we came up with a system for the players we had, and that's my philosophy as a coach. You don't keep the same plays every year you change it for the talent you have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And of course we had Hakeem Olajuwon. I would not be here if I did not have his cooperation and his belief. He was fantastic and a classy guy. I had great players on that team. Every time I see them -- I see Sam. I'm looking for the day that Sam Cassell is a head coach, and I want to see him cussing at players the way I cussed at him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"The other thing I want to say is I made a lot of good moves. I made some crazy moves. I traded Robert Horry twice. But I really believe he belongs in the Naismith Hall of Fame. He's proven it time and time again. He's made so many teams champions playing a role, and that's so important. It isn't about just the stats. It's about getting results. I pray that one day he's going to be able to stand up there and accept that honor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I want to thank the owners that had confidence in me to run their teams Charlie Thomas, Les Alexander and Jerry Buss. But especially the players. Then of course my assistant coaches. I still talk to my assistant coaches. We're like brothers. We still talk basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Having Carroll with me, just think about being in a high-pressure job with your older brother sitting right next to you. So that brought me a lot of comfort."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I'm just blessed to be here. Thank you, guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"If I could, I just want to mention something that happened earlier today. Rudy had a thing to go speak to NBA Entertainment. We went over to the JW Marriott and went down to this huge room, and it was really interesting to me. You see the NBA Entertainment people here and there and around the building, but there was a group of over a hundred people that were together. There were whiteboards with all kind of stuff written Stay on this guy, this could happen. It was like an unbelievable thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy spoke to these people today, and it gave, really, a unique perspective. He was fantastic."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"I also want to mention Rudy's girlfriend, Lisa Marcussen, is here as well. So thank you for being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,I know we have some questions.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"The truth behind it is it came from Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns, who said, ""The Rockets have the heart of a champion. That's why they beat us."" They had us down a couple years, and we fought back and won that series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Now, Charles Barkley had another quote. He said, ""They're like those damned Texas roaches you step on them and you think they are dead, and they scurry away."" I thought I would pick his better than, you know laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,Jim Boylen.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Yeah, we all started in the film room. I was in the film room for Bill Fitch. In fact, I have to give Bill Fitch so much credit. He worked my butt. I'm telling you, if I had a smile on my face, ""You need some more to do."" I did the video. I broke down the video. I did the scouting report. I did the walk-through and the college scouting. That's five people's jobs right there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"But it prepared me to be a solid coach. I need stuff like that. When I don't have stuff to do, my mind wanders. I get in trouble when I start thinking too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy and I both worked for Coach Fitch. Coach Fitch told me the story that he used to have Rudy, when Rudy first started as an assistant coach, in the visiting arenas, he would go to the top of the arena with a camera. Bill called it the wide angle. Bill always wanted to have the wide angle in case there was some kind of incident that happened that the TV cameras wouldn't quite get."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"If you can envision a guy who is a future Hall of Famer as a coach, and probably should be as a player as well, up at the top of ARCO Arena in Sacramento, with a small video cam, filming the game as it's going on, and Carroll Dawson was the only guy on the bench at the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,That's right.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RICK CARLISLE,"Talk about paying your dues, pretty amazing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I remember as we pulled into Hobby Airport, which is a small airport in Houston, the fans were there at 300 in the morning. That inspiration was unbelievable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"But I stopped at the front of the plane and I said, ""Guys, if I told you all we had to do was win two home games and we would be world champions, wouldn't you think that's a heck of a good deal?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Then we played a hell of a team. Maybe the worst team for us to match up with, with New York, because they had all the big guys, and this was an era where there was a lot of rustling and bumping. Good defense was bump the guy at halfcourt, bump him at the top of the key."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So we had to come up with a strategy because at that time, we were sort of what I call a one primary scorer in Hakeem, and I relied on him so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I like being an assistant coach. I love helping people. I love the game. I cannot tell you what basketball did for me. I mean, I was from a very poor family. My parents were not educated. My father went to the second grade. My mother went to the sixth grade."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,They were so shy. I didn't even know how to sit at a table and have a meal because we only had one table and we only had two chairs. So I was so behind as far as being socially compatible with the world.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"But basketball, I started playing that game, and luckily for me, in my hometown, which is in the middle of Detroit, at our junior high, all the great players in that area would come and play there because we had an L-shaped recessed pole because you get killed playing in Detroit with a straight pole, and I got to play basketball there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"If you guys got time, I'll tell you a little bit about my other sport. I played baseball as a kid. Was an All-Star. Played against the greatest Little League player of all time. Art ""Pinky"" Deras, Hamtramck, Michigan, in 1959, went to Williamsport and won. So that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I had an uncle, my cousin who played second base, he said, ""You've got to have a game plan. You ain't going to college unless you get a scholarship. Your family doesn't have it."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,So we had a plan. Baseball was going to be it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I didn't love baseball, even though I was good at it. For some reason, I loved basketball. But in junior high, I never played one second. I got in against the teachers. I had the French teacher isolated. I shook him. I shot it. Air ball. Laughter That was my junior high career."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So when I told my uncle I was quitting baseball, he says, ""What about our plan?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""I'm going to do basketball."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He says, ""Rudy, you're an All-Star in baseball. You sit on the bench."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""I'm going to go out for the team."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So I go out for the freshman team, and a day before the cut, one of my buddies said, ""Hey, man. I'm in the coachs home room. I saw the list. You ain't on the list."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""Are you on the list?"""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He said, ""Yes."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I went, ""I'm better than you."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Now, the coach was an ex-University of Michigan linebacker who knew nothing about basketball. He just took the job to make some extra bucks."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So me being a shy kid, I would never approach somebody, but I wanted to play basketball so I challenged the guy, before he could announce the cut, to a one-on-one game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"At that playground, at that junior high, Detroit Pistons came there. Mel Daniels, college All-American, I played against him there. That's where I learned the game. I was so lucky. But like I said, social skills, when I think about I'm a coach and I've gone up and I get so locked up trying to give a speech."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"In fact, I think I was telling Rick, when I was in junior high, this teacher said, ""Man, you need to get out of your shell. You need to run for class president."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I said, ""Oh, no, that's not me."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I didn't know how to do a speech and all that. I go up to the microphone, I'm so nervous. I grab my fingers and crack my knuckles into the mic and everyone starts laughing. It was the most embarrassing thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I had a sadistic friend that wouldn't let them stop. He brought it the sound volume up and the roars kept going. I said, ""I'm never going to speak to anybody again."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"To think that I'm up here doing this stuff. The long road it took, that journey. But basketball was the vehicle, man. Basketball does so much. All sports do it. I just feel lucky as hell."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Pinky, we had nicknames in our city. It was a Polish city. So we had a girl who went to Wimbledon at a very young age. Her name was Peaches Bartkowicz. What was so wonderful, I'm so blessed that at our little park -- Hamtramck has one square mile, and we had a park there. We had a Hall of Fame tennis coach who taught at the courts there and then the Little League stuff and that was all volunteer coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"So Pinky, he was in the Cardinal farm system. He went up there and came back and became a policeman in the suburbs. He passed away maybe five years ago. Such a humble guy. His kids never knew what a great baseball player he was."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And then Samuel, there was something about Sam. Back then, I was a head coach, but I still thought like a scout. So I did the tapes and I did Sam first. He was like the fourth-rated point guard that year from the scouting services."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I watched Sam first. I said, ""I like this guy, he's pretty damn good."" And I looked at the guys ahead of him and I said, ""No, no, no, I'm going back to Sam."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I wound up watching every game of Sam's. Then we brought him in for an interview and we just clicked. He was a basketball player. He was like the guys on that court that I played. He wasn't thinking about golf then or doing this and all that I'm a player. When he goes in the gym, he's one of the alpha guys. He's going to be in there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"We kept calling him, ""Where have you visited, where have you gone?"" Nobody even brought the guy in to interview him. I couldn't believe it. I think Robert might have been -- I can't remember which one was first, but those are my babies, and I want the best for them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I was lucky the Rockets gave me the ability to make the picks. A lot of times, you have a different department doing it and it doesn't jive. It was a perfect storm. We were a family. We worked so well together. And then bringing Clyde Drexler back in to join Hakeem, maybe the only star that we could have made that trade for in the middle of the season because they had that relationship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I would have said, ""No, I'm going to give loyalty to these guys. I'm going to let them defend their championship."" But we were so bad. We had gotten happy feet. We were losing to teams that we shouldn't, and it became available. We said, ""Let's pull the trigger."" And Clyde was phenomenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Well, you know, it's funny. I looked at the assets. I looked at the positive of players and I would get excited. It's like chemistry. What he can do what this guy can do and all that and how you put that together. I loved diagramming something that not everybody is doing and put -- maybe that guy is better going left we'll shift the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"First of all, treating people with respect, until they prove they don't deserve it. And I did. I just loved -- when I saw a player, it looked like all the things he could do was such an asset."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I think that that's why they felt -- they would say a player's coach. I don't know what a player's coach is. There is a separation. You have different roles and all that. As a young guy, I'm sure Joe Mazzulla has had to go through all that stuff, learning how to do things. Sometimes you've got to be tough."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"In fact, the year that we did decide to do the trade, I had what I called two helicopter halftimes. That's when you take your coat off and you swing it around your head and you throw it and get upset. But it doesn't happen often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,So I hope that answered it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I think that we responded really well. You know, the way their defense is set up and how much they're loading up and converging at the rim, it just puts us in positions to attack and find the easy kickout reads and just to keep the ball popping and things like that so we can get good to great shots on each and every possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, every time I'd take a couple dribbles, there was, like, three people were right there. So we got a bunch of shooters on our team and guys that can space the floor. They kept leaving Jrue open. So it wasn't like I had to do anything spectacular. It was just about finding the open guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"Good thing we don't have to find out. We're very, very fortunate to have him and he was excellent tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah. And you guys are smart enough to know the way our team is set up. Like, we have so many talented guys on both ends of the floor, that it could be a number of guys on a given night. We have a really talented team, and that's how we win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, the way they started the game, right? They were playing faster. You could tell that they wanted to shoot more threes. Neither team really shot the ball well from the three, but you could tell that that was part of their plan, just to play faster and shoot more threes and crash the glass a lot more as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, there's different ways, I guess, to phrase that. It's not all about scoring. I can be the guy rebounding and getting assists and drawing attention, right? I'm going to have the ball in certain spots, right? I draw so much attention. It's not always -- I'm not always going to be the guy to get the shot, but sometimes sacrificing, being in those spots to make the play that we get the best shot possible, knowing that what they want to take away in their schemes and things like that. So being the guy in different ways. Maybe you don't score all the points, but you do all the things that put your guys in the best position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"It has a lot to do with that I've been here before and we didn't win, and it's just like, you know, we're so close to what we're trying to accomplish, why would I let my ego or my need to score all the points gets in the way of that. There are going to be times where I need to score, and obviously, I need to shoot better. Golly. But you know, really, we always talk about do whatever it takes for however long it takes. If I need to have 16 potential assists every single night and that's what puts us in the best position to win and it doesn't mean I'm the leading scorer, by all means, if that gives us the best chance to win, sign me up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"That was a big-time play for those guys to get back. I fell on the ground, so as soon as I just turned my head and looked up, I seen that they made a play at the rim. That was big, guys making winning plays at crucial times on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYSON TATUM,"I think, from a team aspect, it's just a natural process. There's a lot that goes into joining a new team, from a personal standpoint and then, you know, you've been so used to a different organization, now you come to a new team and having to learn personalities and play style and things like that. I've had a relationship with Jrue from a few years ago, we won a gold medal. So I would just, I guess, check in or always remind him, I guess, that, you know, to be yourself and, we're going to need you in big moments, obviously like tonight. Not that maybe he didn't need the reminder, but just letting him know throughout the season how much we value him and things like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Very important obviously. To go to Dallas now 2-0. Its going to be some tough games on the road, but its good we took care of business tonight and go to Dallas up 2-0."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I feel good. Feeling good. Yeah, I dont think its anything serious. But we will look at it tomorrow and go from there, but all good. Ill be good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Today I felt better. A little better conditioning. Like I said before, even though I had a really good comeback game, its tough to jump into the rhythm like that and have the conditioning and have the rhythm and have all of those things. But I think I did a decent job tonight again and helped the team win and thats it. We move forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not difficult at all. Ill die out there if we need. So just kept going. Was a little bit limited, so the smart thing was to get Al back in there and close out the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I think I have to give a shout-out to our best defensive guys like Jrue Holiday, D-White. JB has been tremendous on both ends of the floor. All three of those guys played incredible today. We just have so many weapons that its tough. But defensively, Id say, those guys and Al take us to a different level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, first it starts with our transition defense. If we don't get back and make it five-on-five, it's hard to be able to do that great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"And then the ball pressure, and then just the individual pride, taking on the pride of guarding you and then the guys off the ball, being able to do both, shift and get after shooters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Team defense, the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like we got a group of guys that really want to win. Been around a long time, and they want to do it together. When you have a locker room that has ownership and takes it upon themselves to hold each other accountable, you've got a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"The guys want to win and make that decision, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to win. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, we still do have blind spots. We're always going to have blind spots. I think it's just recognizing those and understanding how we can leverage them by using the guy next to us to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, before that, I think the play of the game can't go unnoticed, the humility of our team, is Payton's shot at the end of the quarter. You see guys around the league pass up on that shot or fake like they want to take it, so that their numbers don't get messed up. He takes pride in taking that, and that's winning basketball. So that's the first and foremost."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"That should have been the first question, is the ability of everybody on our team to do different things that lead to winning. I'm really tired of hearing about one guy or this guy or that guy and everybody trying to make it out to be anything other than Celtic basketball. Everybody that stepped on that court today made winning plays on both ends of the floor, is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"To answer your question, Jayson makes greatness look easy. He does it in a lot of different ways. He does it on defense, he does it on rebounding, he does it on passing, he does it on screening. He's a tremendous player and not hard to coach him. When he has the ability to affect the game in different ways, we're a different team. But it takes everybody to do it. That should answer everyone's question."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"The emphasis and where he's grown over the last two years is to take what the defenses give him and learn to impact the game in many different ways. Because of the type of team that we've had, especially this year, he's seen a bunch of different coverages and he's seen different matchups because teams have to match up with him. So coming into a game, it's kind of similar to a puzzle and he's done a great job learning how to solve the puzzle and do different things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Tonight, with the way that they were rotating and the way that they were defending, the most important thing was making the right play at the rim. We were able to stay out of transition because our guys made that. So I thought he did a tremendous job doing what the game called for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, you got to take a look at -- we gave up a 26-point first quarter and then three 25-point quarters. In the 26-point first quarter, we messed up the two for one and fouled a three-point shooter for three free throws. Luka gets two shooting free throws, we give up a transition basket to P.J. Washington, P.J. Washington hits an above-the-break three. That's almost 70 percent of the points there. So, like, the game was going the way we wanted it to go outside of the things that we can control. I thought our guys took the poise and remained in the mindset and the toughness to understand that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"And then Jrue, it's connected and that's what people don't realize, is like every guy on our team can't be at their best if this guy doesn't do that. So Jayson's facilitating, Jaylen's decision-making. That leads to Jrue's playmaking, and the way that they're defending us, we have to make multiple plays. We have to have multiple drives. I think Jrue did a great job -- guys did a great job finding him, he did a great job attacking closeouts and then either kicking it back out for a second drive or getting an open shot. And then what he can do defensively. It just goes back to everybody on the team works to impact the game differently every single night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,That was sick.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it just comes back to he's not defined by one thing. He's just a little bit of everything. He can handle a pick-and-roll, he can score in pick-and-roll, he can stay spaced. He's not defined by scoring. He rebounds, he plays defense, he can play pick-and-roll, ball handling, the pick-and-roll screener. He's had blocks on bigs. So he's just another guy that's selfless and wants to impact the game in any way that he can, and it looks different every night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the thing about him is the confidence that he has to maybe go some possessions or a half or -- because teams are guarding us differently, his frequency can be impacted because of that at times. But he just fights to impact the game in different ways."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, the most important thing is getting a good shot and not turning it over. So in the first half, even though miss and our points per shot was much higher than theirs, I liked every shot that we took. That's the most important thing, is take what the defense gives you, whether it's a layup or three."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"The second piece to that was our offensive rebounding. So I think we had an offensive rebounding rate in the first half of, like, 41 percent, and it died down in the second half. But when you're not shooting it well, you still want to make the right plays so that it doesn't impact the other end of the floor. But you have to have the offensive rebounding capacity to get extra possessions, and I thought we did a really good job of that in the first half and hit some timely ones in the second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"No, he's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"He has the humility and selflessness to not care if he misses it. He practices it and has an understanding of how a shot like that can impact the end of a quarter and it can impact the run that a team makes. So they had went on a run to end the quarter, and I thought that shot kind of gave us a little bit of poise and a little bit of momentum that we needed heading into the fourth quarter. That was big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah. Yeah. He takes pride in that, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, because you have to look at the other side of the coin. If you get away from the discipline and doing what you do in those situations, it's going lead to other things, and it goes to the trust that the guys have in each other. So as long as you're taking great shots, you have to trust the process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"On the back end of that, you got to have your offensive rebounding rate to help you. When things aren't going that way, you have to keep them off the free-throw line, which we didn't do a great job of, but we had three 25-point quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JOE MAZZULLA,"So usually what happens is you have those empty possessions on the offensive end, your defense starts to weigh in or you start to mistrust the discipline of your spacing and your shot selection, and you end you giving transition and getting cross-matched. So the guys trusted and stayed discipline and we were able to stay out of cross-matches and we were able to kind of keep the game in the way we wanted to play it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,My interpretation? It looked like a foul. But it wasn't called. So it wasn't a foul.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, just trying to keep -- Boston is a team that can run off threes in a hurry. Just trying to keep that from happening."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Also, looking at just trying to give my guys some rest because they were fighting extremely hard. We are playing uphill, and so the lead went from 6 to 12, but then we responded after that second timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Big. The small things, you know, we have to do the small things, and that's part of the game. Those are points that we left on the board, and we didn't shoot free throws well tonight, and we have to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,He had great looks. They just didn't go down. That's just the game of basketball. Sometimes you make them. Sometimes you don't. You continue to keep playing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,He had some good looks that just didn't go down for him tonight.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he was great. No matter what he says, that's just who he is. He's a leader. It's not all on him. It's a team. We win as a team, and we lose as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"So he put us in a position. He was really good tonight. Unfortunately, we just couldn't get over the hump. I thought our defense was really, really good. We've just got to take care of the ball. There's too many turnovers that gave them points, and then also being able to -- we've got to score the ball, and right now, we've got to find someone to join Luka and Ky in that scoring category."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think Luka is a special player. He's one of, if not the best player in the world, and he causes a problem. He's able to find guys. Again, creating open opportunities, and we just didn't take advantage of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And we'll go back and look and see if we can get even better looks. But the looks that we got, we just missed some open threes. It was good to see Exum knock down an open three, and hopefully we can build on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we do have quite a few young players. And for them to have fun and enjoy this, and learn from it, and that's what they are doing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And we've counted on them all year, not just here in the Finals, but throughout the season and also in the Western Conference Finals or the playoffs with Oklahoma City or the Clippers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And for them, it's just a matter of getting comfortable and going back home. Hopefully that will help."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"We've just got to stay positive. Some of us have been in this situation before, and so just take one possession at a time, and we've got to focus on Game 3, and that's all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they haven't lost a game since May something, right? Yeah, they're hot. And not just on the road, but at home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"We've got to protect home, and that's it. We've got to find a way, continue, again, to build on our defense. Our defense put us in a position to win tonight. Unfortunately, our offense didn't help us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"And so, again, Ky and Luka are going to get their looks. We have got to get someone else involved of being able to knock down some shots. Defensively, we can build on this and we can be better. We've got to take care of the ball. If we can take care of the ball, hopefully that gives us more opportunities at scoring."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, well, I think it's a matter of not just playing one-on-one but setting -- setting it up so that they can get a live ball catch and be able to work. With Luka there for a minute, he was playing below the defense, and we were able to get him on the box or at the nail, and he took full advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Just being able to move the pieces around. And I thought we did that. We've got to take care of the ball. I've said this I sound like I'm repeating myself. But if we can take care of the ball and not give them live-ball turnovers where they are not just laying up the ball or dunking, it puts us in a better seat. We've got to take care of the ball. That's the next step in the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we are not down. We're positive. This is a group that believes. We didn't get an opportunity to get a split or win two here on the road. Now Boston held serve. Now we've got to go home and hold serve."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Luka's questionable. So, we'll see how he feels when he warms up and make that decision."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,I think taking a charge or diving on the floor for a loose ball.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yes, just one game plan. If he's out, we're prepared to go without him, next man up. If he's going, the game plan doesn't change. He's in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,We've been in this seat pretty much the whole playoffs. So nothing changes.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought yesterday was a great day for us on the floor, and then also watching the game. And then I think for our group, who has been around, we tend to be loose, and I thought yesterday was a perfect example of us getting better and understanding what we have to do tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at Ky, he's a vet. He's been on this stage multiple times. But he's played the game where he wasn't effective offensively, or up to his standards, and he will take a look at what he can do better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Again, understands what he has to do tonight. Hopefully we get those same shots. We truly believe that he'll knock them down, and hopefully that puts us in a position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Maxi is doing great. He feels great. Hopefully we can find some more minutes for him tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"Well, I think as a player, I mean, it's different. But as a coach, there's a lot of waiting when it's spread out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"So you've got to be able to pace the information that you're giving to guys. Don't want to overload them too early. You have to understand that with the break in between, the off-days or the days that you're not going on the court, but they are getting stimulated to still understand they have a job to do that's as a coach."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"As a player, you're just trying to figure out how to put yourself in a better position if you did lose, if you did win, you're anticipating the adjustments, what the team is going to do to try to slow you down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JASON KIDD,"So two totally different things. Again, one is -- also involves the physical activity. The other one has you standing or sitting. So definitely different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, we beat ourselves a little bit tonight just on our turnovers and just some of our defensive rotations. They got a lot of opportunities, second-chance opportunities, where they got an opportunity to go into the fast break and just create just mismatches in transition."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"Look at some of the positives for sure where we won the first and fourth. But at the end of the day, we've got to win all four quarters if we want a great chance against this team. And we have to make sure that we create enough separation where we can play comfortably, too, and freely."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So we had a good pulse about the game, I believe, going up until halftime. And then afterwards, you know, they did what other great teams do, you know, where they put their foot on the gas pedal, started pushing a little bit more, penetrating down the lane a little bit more and creating some opportunities at the free throw line. And they converted tonight, 19-for-20."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So you've got to give them credit. They definitely picked up their defensive pressure, but finally we got some great looks as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It's definitely a great test for us. They did what they had to do. They won both games at home, and now it's our job to go home and win both games at home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"You want to take advantage of playing in front of your home crowd, feeling confident and being able to play in a familiar place. And like I said, they handled what they were supposed to do, first two games, and now it's our job to go home and handle our business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"But you've got to give them credit. They kept competing. We kept competing. We've just got to stay together in some of the tough times throughout the game where it could be a four-point lead on them or four-point lead that we have. We just have to keep competing, and I think we'll be in a better place. But feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's the confidence that I have in myself. A lot of shots were hitting the back rim. That could piss you off as a competitor, but it's all part of the game of basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"And you have to accept the ups and downs of this. That's, I would say, the toughest challenge when you're in a series. You want to play extremely well, especially when you're playing in a Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It wasn't all on me, but I'm definitely taking the majority of it because my teammates look to me to convert a lot of these shots and ease the burden of not just Luka but everyone else and settle our team. We definitely made our dinner on the defensive end, but now offensively I have to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"We talked about this last series, he did something similar. But when you're in the Finals and you're taking the brunt of the accountability, he definitely -- he's in the right for wanting to single himself out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"But this is a team game. He's not alone, and we are going to tell him that. As expected, he's fresh off the court. He's spilling into his emotions, feels like he could play better, just like me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"I would take the brunt of the responsibility. The first two games weren't the best for me, especially him scoring 25-plus the points, getting rebounds, getting assists, doing the intangibles, and for me I've always felt responsible for getting other guys comfortable out there, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It's on all of us. I'm pretty sure if you hear what everybody has to say, they will say that they can do something better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"But I think the message right now is just get our bearings together. We lost by seven points. We don't want to take the total number back home and say we are proud of that. We don't want to do that. We want to go home and be prepared to win games, and in order to do that, we have to be ready to defend this good Boston Celtics team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"It's just adjusting to the pace. They are playing a great style of basketball, a great brand of basketball where they are pushing in transition. Sometimes those opportunities don't come as often or as easy. They have guys backloaded. They have a lot of guys that are athletic and running back in transition."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"You saw when P.J. had an opportunity to cut it to five, you saw Derrick White contest him at the rim. You saw Derrick White over there again contesting against D-Lively, even though he got dunked on, he still came over there and contested. That's what they have been doing. They have a lot of pride on that end. And they are not going to be easy on us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So on the fastbreak component, we definitely can create more opportunities for ourselves when we are in Dallas and look forward to doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I just chalk that up to just being in Boston. You know, some of those shots, they go up in the air, and I remember last game Sam Hauser caught it in the corner, and I don't think he even brought the ball down. It was practically all net."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"They feel very confident here. They have been a great team all year. Look at their record, I don't know how many total games they have lost since the postseason started. But I don't think it's more than six or seven."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So they have really made their identity here. They want to take care of home court. And now it's our job to go home and do the same. Being in the Finals before, down 0-2, I have a little experience in this. Didn't play particularly well in the first two games in that series, too, that I'm referring to in 2016."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So now I'm just really leaning in on what I've experienced, what I've learned and some of the lessons I've been able to make sense of in how to come back in this series because it is going to be a possession-by-possession thing, and it is going to be the hardest thing that we've ever done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"So I think we've got a great feel, a great experience here in Boston of what the Finals is like for our group. Now we go home and shake off the cobwebs a bit and prepare for another fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"Very, very proud of our group. We understood that we had to protect home court. We knew they were going to come out and be more aggressive. We were able to withstand their runs and protect home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I feel like we are just very connected as a group. Were just out there trying to play hard and compete and make plays. Its just unbelievable, the will of these guys in this locker room."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, he was unbelievable. His effort defensively and everything he brings on that end. And then on offense, making reads, making the game easy, making the right decisions. Hes so poised and you can tell that he has been in these types of moments. Just very composed and just out there getting the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,AL HORFORD,"I thought Jayson was unbelievable. Just navigating everything, getting everybody involved, taking shots when he needed to, defensively being solid, rebounding the ball well. JT just doing it all. Were asking a lot from him and he continues to step up and answer the call for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"If I could say something before we jump in. I want to address the comment that was made yesterday. I feel like people kind of took that out of context. I've been hearing that I prefer JB over JT and that's not what that was. I like to praise my teammates. I like to praise my teammates when they're playing well, and I feel like that's what I did my best to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Again, I don't think I'm shredding the defense. I think it's moreso JT and JB. Especially tonight, JT was getting into the paint and being double-teamed and making the right plays out of it and just finding me. Just either being at the dunker spot or being in the corner. He has that vision as a playmaker, so I would give that to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Well, first, I fouled Kyrie and put him on the free-throw line and I got my third foul, so Payton came in for me. I didn't want to foul him, but I'm kind of glad that I did. The energy that Payton brings, him just having the balls to take that shot. He's done it so many times this year. Where he's had the courage to take it and he's knocked it has been huge for us. So it was definitely a confidence boost and really just boosted us for the rest of that game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think when you sacrifice together and you do something together, it brings you closer. I think being able to go through wins and losses and to build something, it means a lot. So when you go through things like that, I think it makes you closer and I think that that's what this team has done. From 1 to 15, somebody's sacrificed something. It's been great and the journey's been awesome, but at the end of the day, the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think just trying to get into space and trying to be in his vision. I know that sometimes when I drive and I might get stuck, I need somebody to drift with me or to kind of be in space and be in my vision. So I think for the most part, I just try to stay in front of him, give him a good outlet. He's been making great reads."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, when I first got traded here, he was obviously one of the first people that I talked to, and I just think his positive nature. He's kind of this kind soul, somebody who has great energy about him. So every time that I talk to him and every time I see him, he's always been encouraging. This has been from the beginning. It's always nice to have somebody like that have your back and, again, somebody like that in your corner in your organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I'm a utility guy. I'll do whatever. I'm here to win. I feel like they brought me here to win, and I'll do my best to do that. But at the end of the day, this is their team. I know it's probably just as much my team as theirs, but again, I feel like I talked about this before, the pressure that they have on themselves to execute and to be great is a little bit different than my pressure. And, again, I've always been honest about that and how they always handle themselves has been something that's been so honorable. So it's just, it's slightly different. They're superstars and I'm here to support."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, well, that one we were actually down 2-0, that was slightly different, but --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"And that's, and that's all I remember, too. So I think it's a little different that -- again, a different team, different setting, different year, definitely having COVID year, it was a bit weird. I think being on this team, the journey to this point has been, great, but we still know being up 2-0 means nothing. Job's not done. We have to do whatever it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I would say maybe I'm a bit more comfortable. Just knowing kind of the pressure and the atmosphere and obviously what's on the line, this is a bit different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, in huddles like that, it's intimate, and it's something that we kind of hold close and dear to ourselves. I think in times like that, encouraging each other, being able to police ourselves in times like that when we might be doing something that is uncharacteristic. Or even if we're doing something great, all those things are brought up in those moments to where we can really just go out there and do our best to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, I love my teammates. They have been here before. They have been here before and they know what it takes to get to this point. They have shown it. You've seen them in the Eastern Conference Finals and you've seen them in the Finals before. We're all determined as a team. We all want this and it's something that, it's collective. I won't say that I do much or I talk much. I feel like I'm more of an action type of guy. I go out there and I play as hard as I can and do whatever the team needs for us to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's natural. I think that they had chemistry and some things I had to figure out. But that just goes to show how great of teammates I have. There's been times where I've struggled kind of figuring out my place or what I need to do to help the team win, and Derrick has been the person who has talked me through it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I've been point guards on other teams and I've been shooting guards on other teams. But Derrick is our point guard, and he's shown that the whole season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JRUE HOLIDAY,I would say that there are different times in the season where each guy's kind of come and talked to me about how they felt and how they saw the game and what I could do to help and all that. That's helped me out tremendously getting to this point.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,Stay consistent on defense. Our communication is always tested when it comes to games like this because of how much they want to play on the perimeter. We have to make sure we get those guys inside the line and make sure our rotations are top-tier.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just got to play to the physicality. At the end of the day, you know, they are pushing us around. We've got to be able to do the same thing. That's kind of like what the message was when we came out the second half Set the tone physically."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Having poise offensively and making sure we get the right guys downhill. Well, pretty much any guy downhill to be honest with you. We've got a lot of guys that can drive to the basket and score the ball that gravitate a lot of attention from anybody that's the low man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"So we just have to make sure as bigs, me and D-Lively, make sure we get the guys downhill to where they can get a shot off, or we get a rebound if they miss it, or just throw the lob over the top."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure we are focusing on the positive things at the end of the day. I know Luka said it was a lot on him when it came down to it. It's a team it's a team game. You know we can't have one person taking the blame for everything because you know we all have faults in certain areas on the floor and we make up for that trying to just really continuing to play through this as adversity, any obstacle that we face, we always have to play through that as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"So he missed free throws I missed free throws. There's a lot of guys that missed free throws tonight, and that hurt us. So it's not just on him. Not on Kyrie. It's a team thing, and we just have to come out with the same mindset that we had tonight and try to win all four quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, this is the biggest stage in the NBA. Everybody wants to be here at the end of the season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"So we just have to come prepared, shake off the nerves, get the butterflies out. It's going to be crazy atmosphere, crazy energy. It's the NBA Finals. Everybody wants to be in this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,For sure. They got their crowd into it when we came here and they did their job when it came to protecting home court and we have to do the same thing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just focus on the positives. At the end of the day, we just find ways to just make adjustments to what we kind of lacked in certain areas, most definitely. Watch film, learn from it and be ready for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"No, I don't think so. I feel like they just made plays at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Our poise. Be comfortable in the situation. Embrace the atmosphere and really embrace whatever's going to be thrown at us. This is a great team that we are playing against, and they are going to throw everything they can at us to just rattle us in any given circumstance. So we just have to take our time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, I actually was -- you know, I always want to play. So all day we did a lot of things to get ready for the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,Good. Good. I was okay.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"I'm sorry, I don't know who is the Celtics owner."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Every game we lose, it's a missed opportunity for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, obviously didn't work because we lost. But at the end of the day, we've got to make some more shots. I think my turnovers and my missed free throws cost us the game. So I've got to do way better in those two categories."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"But at the end of the day, we've got to make shots to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,That's why they are the No. 1 team in the NBA with the No. 1 record. They have a lot of great players. Basically anybody can get off.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Honestly, I think we didn't do a bad job defending today. We took away threes. We contested more threes. And like I say, I had too many turnovers, and we missed a lot of free throws. So I think that cost us the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they are physical, yeah. But they try to guard one-on-one. I think today they tried to help more. I was able to get some teammates open. But they are physical. They are very physical. We let them be physical. So they are pretty, pretty amazing on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,I think it was a charge. We don't really know because I didn't feel it until the next day. I was really surprised. So we think it was a charge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,We've got to make shots. We've got to make free throws and less turnovers. Those three things I think are the key for a win -- to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Score more points. But at the end of the day, it's basketball, away or home. We've just got to play better basketball to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Sorry, I don't understand you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,LUKA DONCIC,"Yes -- I don't really know how to respond, but yes. I'm sorry."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was great. In moments where we gained some momentum, that helped us get over the hump. So tonight we came out, we didn't shoot the ball well. We were a little flat, but I felt like the crowd helped us stay in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue has been an example of just excellence. Since he's been here, his role has been different from what it was the last few years on Milwaukee, and he's been able to adapt. Not a lot of guys can do that, be versatile, play different roles and different styles and still have an effect on the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue, he just came in, he wasn't on the ball as much, still guarded at a high level, but became a corner three-point specialist. That's just a testament to his greatness. Tonight they wanted to emphasize loading up, making us make the right reads over and over again, and Jrue had a lot of opportunities tonight and he took advantage. He's just a hell of a player, hell of a person, great teammate. I credit the victory to him tonight. He played well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, we got a lot of weapons on our team, so we just got to trust what we've been doing all season long, trust our game plan. We didn't hit shots tonight. I thought we had a bunch of great looks. If you go back and look in the first half, Sam had a bunch of great looks, D-White had some look that didn't go down. But we didn't panic. We kept guarding, we stayed in the game and we kept trusting it and we made enough tonight to win the game. But we expect to shoot the ball better going forward when we get on the road."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Derrick is -- he's been, you know, All-Defensive all season long. In that moment right there, we make a tough rim read. Rim reads lead to transition, so we want to manage that a little bit better. But it's the playoffs, you got to just get back and make a play. Derrick White sprints back. I see they have an advantage. I sprint back and was able to make a play there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"But those are the type of plays that help you win games. It's just effort, that's what it comes down to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue is a great teammate, nothing short of that. He's brought championship pedigree to our team. So nothing Jrue says we question. Jrue, he comes in and he just is who he is. He's got that demeanor, that killer-like mentality, and we respect it. You know what I mean? He's a great teammate and it's just an honor to play next to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"But it's just an example of what we do and have been doing all season long. How you finish quarters is big. We didn't finish that quarter great. We got a lot of open looks, we gave up some. There was some bad fouls. One of them was mine. I fouled Luka on the back cut, and then me and JT got mixed communication on the switch. Luka had a three."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,We got to finish quarters better. But Payton checks himself in the game and covers us a little bit by hitting the big-time shot.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. That's the majority of what the battle is, just managing your emotions. How do you handle adversity and your will and your perseverance. Everything isn't going to go according to plan. I wouldn't have hoped that we shot, I don't even know, what, 7-23 from three? We had a few ill-advised turnovers and fouls, but effort makes up the difference."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Your mindset, we play -- I think we played harder than them tonight, and I think that's just going to be the key. If we want to win, we just got to be the harder-playing team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. Just trying to wear on those guys, be as physical as we possibly can, full team effort. Just keep touching them. That's it. I think that those guys are tremendously gifted offensively. They came out swinging. Luka came out in the first quarter, we knew what he was going to do. We knew he was going to be aggressive. But we just stayed with the game plan. We stayed just consistent and we was able to turn him over a few times that helped us push the lead out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, that's just being patient. You got a lot of energy, excitedness, nerves, when the game starts, but sometimes you just got to be patient. And I got to the paint pretty much whenever I wanted, and I could be patient when I get there. I had a few turnovers where I had a little bit more time to wait for the defender to make a choice, because those two-on-one reads are there, where you get to the paint, the defender is, the big is coming, you either kick it to the corner or if he drives down to the corner you kick it to the wing. But don't got to be in a rush. Just protect the ball, make the great decisions and trust your teammates. I think that's what the majority of this is. We did that enough tonight, but I think we need to do it a little more going into Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"We expect them to play better. They have showed that all postseason. I think they have lost Game 1 a couple times, and they came back with a big Game 2 win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,So we expect them to play a lot better. We've got to be even better than we were last game and just try to clean up the things we made mistakes on and understand it's definitely going to be a bigger challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,I feel like always the No. 1 adjustment is to play harder. Play with more physicality. We can't be satisfied. We've got to understand that. We've been talking about that the whole postseason. It's just physicality. So we've got to be ready for whatever they throw at us.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"Each game just gets more and more difficult. The more comfortable you get with the team, the more you know what they like to do, what we like to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"Each game just gets more and more difficult. Each game is a different adjustment, and you've just got to figure out what they change and how we can attack that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it feels way different. I think anytime you make it for the first time, this is just like a dream come true. And it's just a lot going on, obviously. So this year, I'm not surprised by it, just comfortable and ready to compete."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"I think any experience is great to have. Obviously, it was a different series, different time, different team. But all experience is nice. We've learned a lot from that. I think we've grown from it. Whatever it takes to win, and whatever it takes to advance, that's what we've been doing this whole postseason. So whatever it takes. We win, we lose, but we got to be ready to compete at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"First things first, you've got to compete. Just try to make them uncomfortable. Obviously, two great players. They kind of play a little differently, but two great players. Just try to keep them in front and try to have them take tough shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERRICK WHITE,"I love Joe. Love playing for him. He's a great basketball mind. The way he thinks is next level. I think this year he's just much more comfortable, and we all feel comfortable with him as our coach. It's been great just learning from him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I give Drew a lot of credit for my development in helping me get to where I'm at. I started working with Drew when I was in eighth grade and every offseason since then, we've worked out together. That's like family. I've said it a million times that, you know, Drew is a big reason in helping me get to where I'm at, and you know, I'm very thankful for everybody that played a part in helping me, you know, reach my goal and continue to strive in this space that I'm in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"That, you know, far from over, it's an extremely long series and not get too excited or get too down about a win or a loss. Don't feel like that the series is over and that we had it won because of the last game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"And if you lose a game, right, we talk about it all the time that it's going to take however long it takes. If that's four, five, six, seven, whatever, we are trying to just take it one game at a time and not skip any steps, whatever we've got to do to win. That's what we have to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"It's just about reading the game. Draw so much attention, you know, when I have the ball in my hands, and you know, it's about creating an advantage. We always talk about that, watching film, creating advantage, finding the mismatch that we want, and it might not always end up in the shot for you. Or if you set a screen and get a smaller guy on you, just having that mismatch and calling for the ball, right, it may draw other defenders to help, and we can pin in for somebody else to get a shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"You know, those things won't show up in the stats sheet, but it's part of our execution, and sometimes you have to make a sacrificial cut or things like that to generate good shoots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I mean, it's a lot that goes into that, right. Time of the game. Time to score. Who is in the game with me. All those things play a part."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"A lot of times, if you can generate shots for other people and make the defense have to respect those guys, it eventually opens a lot of other things up for you later in the game that you can take advantage of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"No reaction. This is a team sport, right. We understand that. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have JB on our team, and we can say that for a lot of guys, right. We have all played a part in getting to where we're at, and we understand that people try to drive a wedge between us. I guess it's a smart thing to do or try to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,We've been in this position for many of years of guys trying to divide us and say that one of us should be traded or one is better than the other. So it's not our first time at rodeo.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"They really just kind of test your discipline. They test, are you going to make the right play over and over and over again. Even if it's not resulting in you getting the shots or you scoring all the points."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"But you know, you're constantly scoring at a high rate. We are up 20 at halftime. They are trying to test if human nature is going to play a part of wanting to get yourself going. Instead of doing all the things that is making the game easier for the team, you know, you just have to stay committed to doing what's right and making the right play until they adjust their defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,Whoevers open. Laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we understand that. I feel like we're going to get -- I don't want to say their best shot, but you know, we understand that they are going to play a lot better, and we have to be prepared for that. Not let it catch us off guard or, you know, wait till the second quarter if we are down to lock in. Understanding from the jump that they are going to come out and play faster. They are going to shoot more threes. They are going to play harder."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"So I think knowing that coming into the game is the first step. And then, you know, focusing on what we need to do. There's a lot of things that we watch in film that honestly we feel like we could be a lot better at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"All in all, we feel like tomorrow should be really fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we've had conversations about it before. In all reality, we've just had to deal with it for a very long time. I think it's part of us maturing as men, right. Very, very young coming into this league, and just had to deal with all the ups and downs of, essentially, the success that we've had. There's been positive things and there's been negative things that come with that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"We are not the first duo to go through that process, and we won't be the last. So understanding that side of it, and just keeping the main thing the main thing, and focusing on the job that we have front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"I think, like I said, just over time, you learn how to deal with things. There was a point, right, in my career where things did affect me or would bother me that, you know, to hear people talk about me on TV."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"But you just have to come to a realization that, for one, don't take it personal. People have a job to do. You have to respect that. They have to go on TV and give their analysis of, you know, things that they see and watch, and that's fair. You understand what the media side has done for the game of basketball and how we have all benefited from that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYSON TATUM,"Again, people wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't one of the best players. I'm not the only player that they have ever talked about, and I won't be the last. So understanding that side of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I was in my hometown of West Linn. I believe I was in West Linn. Maybe I was in Oregon City. But, yeah, I was back home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just remember KG, after he won, doing the interview after where he was shouting out to his kids and stuff like that, going crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"In 2008, I was 10."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Playing sports, baseball, basketball, running around. Big into sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Not until high school. It's when I transitioned to just hoop.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,Always basketball. I liked it all equally. Baseball and football.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They said that? I don't know if I'm superstitious. Maybe I'm like superstitious like if I have a bad shooting game, I probably won't wear those shoes again. That's about it. Like something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,This feels similar. We've been through it before. So we're used to a lot of things coming. So we know we've got to be ready for Game 2 and try to take care of business.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player so you have to be prepared for a lot of things. You have to play hard, make things tough and hope he misses."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He draws so much attention. So even if he's not shooting the ball well, he can draw a lot of attention. Defenses are collapsing on him. Creates easy shots for teammates even when he doesn't have the ball. He's very impactful, always."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's really relaxed. Quiet. A little bit reserved. Great dude. Easy to be around. Yeah, he's just easygoing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's hard for me to say because I know him. So I know he's one of the best players. But like the way his personality is, he's just laid back. So he's not, like, showboating and acting like he's the best. He's confident but -- I think he's confident knowing who he is so he doesn't feel the need to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I feel pretty good. Yeah. Feel good. Not much more to add. Preparing my body for tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Obviously as I said postgame, it was like a relief, being back on the court, healthy, winning games, starting off the series the right way. It was definitely a relief. But yeah, it's like a lot more work to be done and yeah, tomorrow we get another chance on our home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's huge. It's huge, obviously. But yeah, to be honest, the way I moved, looking back now at the game, and I dont think I even expected myself to be able to be moving so well. That was, again, a good sign for myself and now having two days in between and preparing my body again, getting even probably better conditioning now for next game will be huge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, good, like, how do you say, description of a little bit, especially preparing myself all regular season for the playoffs and round one, something unfortunate happens and staying mentally put and staying in the right place to have the chance to come back later in the playoffs and of course I wanted to come back earlier but it didn't work out that way. But here I am now and healthy and able to put on a good game for my first game back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It was insane. I'm not going to lie. Just walking in the tunnel was like a WWE style walk-in. I didn't even know it was for me at first walking out, hearing that crowd roar and getting real excitement to start the game and give everything to these fans that came."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,We were joking in the back that I should do that next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think that goes unnoticed a lot of times and what goes unnoticed is he doesn't get the credit a lot of times and he's the first one to get all the blame if he doesn't have a monster game. It's a little bit unfair to him. But hats off to him for taking it on the chin and conducting himself as a champion and being like, I'll do whatever it takes for this team to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Of course, he's always the focal point for the other team and JB and then maybe, I don't know, I'm third, fourth, fifth, sixth on the list. That takes a lot of pressure off me. I can have a lot more open looks, a lot more, like, good situations for me. That's credit to JB and JT but especially JT."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"The balance is having proper spacing. Making the right play. I thought we did a good job of fighting for our spacing, making the right two-on-one reads. That's more important than anything else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"And so I think regardless of who we are trying to attack, making sure we are at the proper spacing and making sure we are making the right play based on where the two-on-one read is is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great person. He's a great coach. Just humility, joy, work ethic, intensity that he brings. And, you know, we've grown to have a great relationship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I'm very grateful for him, and I'd like to think that we make each other better. So it's great that he was here. It's great that he was able to share some of his wisdom and got to spend time with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, when I talked with him in the process of deciding if he wanted to come here, I said the thing about our team is we need everybody and we are going to play guys. You don't get to where we are at right now and win a lot of games unless you have great depth."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"And throughout the season, because it's such a long season, what those guys do kind of gets lost in the shuffle. But there was moments where he helped win us games, second night, back-to-back, four in five, whatever it is, NeeNee Neemias Queta and those guys starting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So their ability to just stay locked in and stay professional and impact winning is very important, and so that was what I told him before he came here, and him, the other guys and the player development staff do a great job of just staying on top of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just need to focus on the truth. At the end of the day, nobody knows because they are not in the locker room. And so I think as long as we focus on the truth, we focus on the things that we talk about every day, we focus on the relationships that we build with each other, we focus on just that stuff."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"They can look at it however they want. At the end of the day, what goes on in our locker room, how we communicate with each other, how we build relationships with each other and how we treat each other on and off the floor, that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,I wonder how many of those have been Christian coaches.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, spacing is, like, ages old. It's the most important thing. I think you've seen different spacings based on how the game has changed and how the game has evolved and how your roster evolves and how -- I think the better offenses have gotten, the more creative defenses have gotten, and the ability to put guys in certain spots, protecting the rim, where are your best individual defenders."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So being valuable in your spacing I think is the most important thing because you have an understanding of who is where, and you have an understanding of where the advantages are. And so it's one of those things that you have to fight for. It's a simple detail that, if you don't talk about a lot, it can get overlooked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"But your spacing can manipulate the type of shots that you get and the decisions that you make, and I think that's the fight. Dallas's defense, they are one of the smartest, best defensive teams in the league, and they have the ability to manipulate your spacing with their rotations and with their personnel, and so we've got to be just as creative and just as disciplined in our spacing to make sure that we can counteract that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"That's kind of what Pep has helped me with, spacing. Very important in transitions how you move those guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think as you get into this, you start to realize, once you're in a position, nobody can really relate to you other than people in those positions. So you develop a bond with other coaches and you know what they are going through and you know what the challenges are and the opportunities and the situation you're in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So I think it's really important that we all stick together, me, him, Coach Jim Montgomery, Alex Cora. You just have to stick together and help each other through it because each of our four coaches have been through it, whether it's inside Boston or outside Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"Jerod and I got close as assistants, just how would you do things when it's your opportunity, what have you learned from the head coaches that you've worked for. And now that we are in this position, it's helping each other with the transition and the different experiences."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"The most important thing for guys like Sam and Payton is having an understanding we would not be here without those guys. They have literally won games for us. And you're not defined by scoring. That's one of the strengths of this team top to bottom, whether it's the starters, role guys, not one guy strives to be defined by one thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"So getting two stops on defense, being in the right spot, getting two rebounds, getting to the free throw line, sprinting to manipulate the spacing to get an open shot. All those things count for the same, especially at this time of year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOE MAZZULLA,"And Sam has done a great job in his career of not being defined as a shooter, of being able to do other things. And our team has taken that on, and we have to work to stay to be that well-rounded on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just making sure we make them uncomfortable from the jump. I feel like Game 1 we eased into the game when we shouldn't have. We should have came out and threw the first punch instead of taking the first punch. They are a great-shooting team, and we just have to be able to get them off their spots and force them into our defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY,"Adapt. Learn. As I said before, if we are the same person we were yesterday, then we aren't getting better. Everybody here wants to the right thing and everything we can possibly do to win. That's what everybody on the team needs to do so we can get a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's playing our game of basketball and not going into the game that they want us to play. Playing our game of pick-and-roll. Getting out in pace, getting in space and making them overhelp so we can get open shots and we can get people open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like it's definitely big plays, whether it's a dunk or three ball. As long as our team is together, we are cheering, yelling, connected, it definitely makes other teams question what they are going to do or question their schemes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"Our footwork. Our placing of knowing where our positioning is on the defensive side, no matter if it's setting them down, us being low, not being late on coverages and calling out coverages early so they can't get easy pick-and-pop threes. It's been a lot of fail and learn, fail and get a little bit better. We are not going to get better at all if we don't learn from our mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"We have to get up into them. We can't let him just post up, get the ball at the top of the key and just lace it down because he is going to shoot over the top. It's going to be trying to make sure that we get him off of his stops. Get him one or two feet away from his normal spots so he's a little more uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"All he says is keep your head down and stick to the grind. There's not a lot of things he can do all the way back in Dallas. All he's telling me to do is the little things, whether that's hitting them on the box-out or being able to talk to my teammates on the back side. Just doing the little things so that everybody is connected on the court so that we are not leaving everybody behind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY II,"For sure. I feel like everybody in the first half, everybody is thinking, they can shoot, they can shoot. Whenever we can come out and show that we can defend, we can get them off the three-point line, then it's a different game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DERECK LIVELY,I feel like it's not panic. It's more urgency of getting the job done.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I think we've just got to overall be on a better page together, offense and defense. We gave up way too many rhythm threes for them. They have a very capable three-shooting team. On the offensive side, just finding our spots better, creating the space for Ky and Luka to operate and make the right plays. Overall, finding our spots, communication and play better together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,We believe in each other. We just try to play hard. We saw the mistakes. We watched the tape. So we just have to make the right adjustment and come out with the right energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,We have got to make it a little bit harder on him to get the catches on the elbow. Push out a little bit further and then just stay in front of him and make sure we contest a shot the best way possible. We definitely can't let him get into rhythm early.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I think we dealt with good crowds in Game 1s before. I feel like OKC and Minnesota were very loud, too. Obviously, this is the Finals and it's the biggest stage. But at the end of the day, we have to focus on our game and play with the right mindset."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I wouldn't say it's a big change for us. We just have to, like I said, focus and do a better job on what we're supposed to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"Of course. We have been together for so long now. We had some trades at the trade deadline. But it gives you time to just spend more time together, play more together. The deeper you get into the playoffs, the bond is growing. Even yesterday in the meeting, just the way we communicated and figure out solutions for the problems, it's just showing that we can grow every day as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"I think there's a big, big gap between Dirk Nowitzki and me. He's one of the greatest ever, so I would never, ever dare to compare myself to him. I also think the role that he had and the playoff run that they had back then was so outstanding and one of the most underrated runs -- not underrated but crazy underdog runs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,MAXI KLEBER,"For me, it's an honor to be here, to fight with the team for the championship. I don't take it for granted. Just come out here and play my hardest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought we were too much one-on-one. We've got to move bodies. We've got to move the ball. Multiple guys have to touch the ball. We were just too stagnant, and that's not the way we play. We've got to be better tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Unfortunately, we are not playing. I don't know how to answer that question. I'm taller. I would post him up, but he would probably be more physical."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,He's one of the best coaches in this league. He's gotten his team to the Finals. They play at a high rate. He understands his group.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"So when you talk about Joe, he's done an incredible job. And it's not easy, especially when you're favored or supposed to be somewhere. It puts a little bit more pressure. But I think he's handled it well. His group plays at a high level. His group plays hard. He's one of the best coaches in the league. For that, we have our work cut out as a coaching staff. We've got to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"He got great looks. Unfortunately, our two quarterbacks had turnovers that normally don't happen. Give credit to Boston. But we believe that the shots that he got in Game 1 were great looks that just didn't go down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,I think there's no panic with this group. We didn't play well in Game 1. Give credit to Boston they did.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But it's a series and we don't just look to capitalize on just one game. We've lost Game 1 a lot of times, and we've responded. We believe that we can respond in Game 2. We just try to take it one game at a time. We didn't have a really good first quarter there at the end. Put us down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,But the guys kept fighting. We found a way to get it to eight. It was very similar to the way the playoffs started for us with the Clippers. We didn't play well. We cut that 30-point lead down and made a game of it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,But we responded in Game 2 on the road. Hopefully we can do the same thing here in Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Jayson, he's one of the best offensive players in this league. Understanding that he puts a lot of pressure behind the three, behind the line, and then also being able to get to the rim. He's not one that just settles."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"We have to, again, try to keep him from getting to the rim, keeping him off the free throw and then giving him wide-open threes. And so that's not easy. It's easier said than done. Again, we just have to make it tough on him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"On the defensive end, he uses his length. He's strong. He's not one to give in. We've got to find other ways to score."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we knew that he was going to play, and he played well. He played well coming off the bench. He's played well starting, or as he showed, coming off the bench."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"We've got to make it tougher on him. When he starts to get going, he can shoot it from halfcourt with range. We have to be able to take some of those threes away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"On the other end, we have to make him work. But we also got to account for -- when you go to the basket, he's going to be there. You have to account that he's got a good chance of blocking the shots. We have to take advantage of his overhelp at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we happened to play the same position, some are a little bit better than others."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But when you look at the things this we have to do just in this series better, we've got to take care of the ball, we've got to make it easier for Ky and Luka. Being able to put those guys in different spots on the floor so there's a little bit stress-free so they can do what they do at a high level. We just didn't do that in Game 1."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But it's really simple conversation when you talk about things that we have to do not just on the offensive end but the defensive end. Ky and Luka take responsibility for that. Our conversations are really simple and to the point. When you talk about the high IQ, you don't have to sit there and paint the picture. You can just get right to it. They understand from my side what I'm asking them to do, and when they respond I understand what their responses are and what they are talking about and what they see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"It's worked at an extremely high level for when we do talk in-game or on a day like today of what we are trying to get to. Those guys trust what I see or what I'm telling them, and I trust their response."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"I think just understanding this group, it's not about screaming or yelling. It's about what we do best, and when we are having fun and smiling is when we are at our best. I just felt there at the end of the first, we just weren't at our best. It was talked about and it's going to happen. It might happen in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But the response from our group has to be quicker and it has to be better. Not where we're talking about we have to score the ball, but we have to get better on the defensive end, and that's being connected. We felt we lost a little connection there at the end of the first. But when we talked about it at halftime, it was a great response and we did play at a better level in that second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we'll make some adjustments. But Boston is going to give the layup to Luka, so he's got to take it. They're not going to give him the lob, and they are not going to give the corner three. So it's two-on-two, and we have to take advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"We missed some layups. We missed some shots in the paint. That happens. But we believe that Ky and Luka will get into the paint and make them in Game 2. But it's no different than what we saw in Minnesota. Just understanding that Boston is a really good defense, and being able to bluff or take away something, we trust that Luka and Ky will pivot and do what's best, and that's take the layup or take the easy two and continue to wear out the paint and layups."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"But we've got to make those, too. Because on the other end if you don't make them and they come down and they make a couple threes, it puts a lot of pressure on your offense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"Well, Jaylen is their best player. Just looking at what he does defensively, he picked up Luka full court. He got to the free throw line. He did everything, and that's what your best player does. Just understanding he plays both sides, defense and offense, at a high rate. And he's been doing that the whole playoffs. I mean, when talk about the Eastern Conference MVP, and it seems like he has continued to pick up where he left off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JASON KIDD,"So he's playing at a high rate. We've just got to be a little more physical with him. And again, we have to keep him off the free throw line and out of the paint because, again, he was finishing at a high rate or he was getting fouled and getting to the free throw line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time. It's not the first time we've heard that Dallas fans are panicking. Shout-out to our fans. We appreciate your support all year. Just stay poised, man. Stay focused on the goal. This mission is bigger than us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"By doing your best not to pay attention to it because a lot of people don't know what they are talking about, and specifically if you've never played that position or been on a team at that level where you have to go through it yourself, and I know that we have people that appreciate the game of basketball that speak on it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"I'm just here to play basketball. It's a dream come true to be at this level. I've had to work extremely hard. I've been a winner my whole entire life. I've obviously had some failures and loss but done a lot more winning. Used to it. In order to be on that type of frequency or that goal, you've got to be selfless in your approach."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously you're not going to get it right all the time, but as a teammate, you just want to push those other things to the side that don't really matter or get you better as a team. So we just leave it to everybody else to argue whose team it is and who has the most responsibility. It's all our jobs to be prepared. S----y conversation, but it has to happen in sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,Just by paying attention to how we prepare and also just adjustments. Sticking to the game plan.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,I mean it was our first time being together as a group in this Finals stage. Experience is the best teacher at times when you don't know what to expect.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Going out there, TD Garden, playing against the Boston Celtics, who are having a historic season. We knew they were going to come out with a lot of verve, a lot of energy. And they have been doing it all year. They have been consistent on their end. I think it's pretty easy to say we can focus on our end and pay attention to what we can control."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But it's a little bit deeper than that. Just got to calm our nerves, poise our nerves a little bit and just be aware of the environment we are in. It's going to be high intense from who we are going against. It's going to be very physical. Some things are going to be called and some things aren't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"I think we got all that experience in Game 1, and we are looking forward to the challenge in Game 2 to play better and being who we have been since post-All-Star Break and just having fun in doing it. This is the highest level of basketball right now. We are the only two teams playing. We are proud of ourselves but we are not satisfied. We've just got to continue to be ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"He was reiterating the same things I'm saying, probably a little bit more simple. But he's been giving us a lot of peace of mind, especially when we are out there, high-intense environment, like I said. Just got to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"By realizing that I've been in this league for 13 years, and I've been playing against the Celtics for quite a few years and I have quite a few playoff series against them, whether wins or losses."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So I just try to be aware that this is a new space that I'm in as one of the leaders of the team and with the new group, and giving them that peace of mind, like I said, when things get tough. We are going against a very historic team in the Boston Celtics, but we're a great team too. We have to remember that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"And engaging with fans here in Boston is always fun. Like I said last week, it's something I'll turn the page over on, too, but people continue to ask me about it and what I think about it, which is cool, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But yeah, this is what makes sports fun. This is what makes the stories fun. Getting a chance to go against a giant like this, whether it be just talking about the team or talking about the environment and the fans and how crazy it can get. This is what I imagine it being like, getting to this stage again, earning our way to be here with my teammates and being able to put our best foot forward going against the best of the best. That's everything you dream of. Everything else is extracurricular."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"No. Not really. Again, I've been able to grow over the past few years to put basketball in perspective. This is an incredible experience that I get to live out for quite a few years of my life. I'm going to learn a lot of lessons that I'm going to apply to life after this. I failed miserably while also not knowing how to compartmentalize or accept the emotions that come with failure, and also being on the successful side, didn't know how to handle that either."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So the past few years have been about that growth perspective for me and learning how to handle myself in situations and circumstances that are going to be more beneficial for me to learn now than learning it when I'm 38 years old, and I'm looking back at my career, and I don't even know how to celebrate that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't expect to be celebrated by everybody. I'm going to, you know, still be aware that a lot of people want to see me fail. But again, I think I pay attention more to the way that I'm celebrated from people that love me unconditionally and I go home and have a peace of mind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"You know, thinking about my time in Boston, I could go down a myriad of things that none of you in here know that I was dealing with, and I don't think a lot of people would care. I think a few people would care and want to hear about it, and I would leave that space open in the future if you ever want to hear about it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But putting into perspective the blowup dolls and remarks that are getting said, that's basketball. When I leave out of here and I walk around Boston, I don't hear a lot of the things that I hear when I'm playing on the court. There's a lot of mutual respect. There's a lot of eye-to-eye communication that's built on just being human, and they appreciate the things I do off the floor, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So there are a lot of Celtics fans out there that still love me, too, surprising to everybody. But when I'm on the street walking around, which I do, you know, it's a lot of love. I get a lot of embrace. I take pictures. My dad is here, he played at Boston University. So there has to be a respect there because if anything happens to my family while I'm here, then it goes way beyond the game, you know."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,And I don't forget things either. Somebody threw something at me while I was here. I've heard it all. Nobody asked me how I felt after that and why it could be a little bit of a traumatic response when I'm back in this environment after somebody does something like that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"You know, so things have changed since then. I've been able to accept what I cannot change but also change the way that I look at things to be more positive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So this is fun for me, man. This is healthy. I'm glad that I can be up here on this stage speaking authentically and then also go home and be at peace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, teaching is fun. Being a student is even more fun. So when you're in a film session with J-Kidd or Coach Sean Sweeney or even Luka, myself, and the rest of our guys, there's a lot of honest communication going on. Just what we see. And we always make sure that we are aware that -- we're a new group in this environment, too. So give ourselves some grace and patience and be ready to play our best game every day and prepare."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"The things we see out there, we have to talk about it. Some of the cues that you would normally have when you make it to this level, we are still developing, and that's okay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So as we look to become an even better team, a greater team through this experience, this is what's needed is just that honest communication."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would start off with this. So, try not to get FOMO as best you can just because you're so used to playing every single day, working out every single day towards a goal, and now that that goal isn't necessarily there to win the Championship, you have to set other goals, and that comes from a personal standpoint. You know, what do you want to accomplish bringing into next season, it starts now while no one is watching and while it's just you by yourself or your brother or you're playing five-on-five."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,Just working on the things that everyone said that you were not great at or you could not do or that you see within yourself that you need to improve.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Because you're seeing how hard it is to get here and how long you have to stay locked in, as you said. So I've been able to find some peace of mind throughout this journey, throughout this year, of just making this phrase, like our team bonding thing, like just peaking at the right time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Some teams peak really early, some teams peak in the middle of the season, and some teams start peaking at the end. Some teams get into the playoffs or get deep into the playoffs and they peak."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"It just depends where you are as a team and your understanding of what you're doing, and also appreciating all the hard work it took to get here. A lot of our peers are watching and trying to get back to where we are, get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"So we have to be aware that the hunger is going to be more next year, but we are also going to be hungry, too, to show why we are one of the best in the world. Two teams left. Dream come true as a kid to be in a Final, see the court change a little bit, see all the stickers, see the 600 media members and credentials we get. It can be a lot, but it's also something you want to appreciate because you never know when you're going to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"Take your time, but also work your tail off right now because I know I'm going to have to get ready for you guys next season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"They're definitely a team that is going to come out swinging, much, much more aggressive. For us, to be able to come out with the same energy and continue to play at a high level like we've been doing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"Every series is different. Every game is different. For us, we understand it's a big challenge. We are not really thinking about the past. We have to focus on this Game 2 and make sure we do the things we need to do to put ourselves in position to win a game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"It presents its own challenges. And now obviously I know that they are going to come out very aggressive, and we are, as well. It's just one of those things that we have to make sure that we just stay the course. Emotions are obviously going to be high. From Game 1 to Game 2, the biggest thing is making sure we are as prepared as we can be and ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"DJ has been great for us. Very clear with his concepts what he wants to do. Creating how he wants us to execute things. I feel like our group, obviously weve bought in, were really locked in and trying to do the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,AL HORFORD,"J-Kidd, man, I see what he is doing. I see what he is doing. Jaylen Brown is an unbelievable player and very special for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think we came out aggressive, which was good. Gave us some leeway to withstand their punch when they came back. I think we did a pretty good job executing for most of the game but keeping our poise, even being up almost 30 and then coming down, cutting it to eight. I think we kept our poise pretty well and pushed it back up to 20."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Something different. They are probably going to try to get more threes. I think their role players are going to make more of an impact, and then they are just going to come out more aggressive. It was Game 1. Its always a feeler game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think when both teams get more comfortable out here, it will be a battle."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's Game 2 of the Finals. I think we are definitely expecting them to swing and come out clawing and fighting. We know in their Game 2s, Luka has started off, definitely been killer, especially, in the first quarter. I think at this point we have to lock into the game plan and do the best we can to kind of withstand their punches and go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we did the best we could trying to take away their lobs. Those are definitely energy plays for them. Two high flyers in Gafford and Lively, we tried to take those away. I think we tried to keep them on the free throw line as best possible, and we know they have corner shooters in Derrick Jones Jr. and P.J. Washington and Tim Hardaway Jr. They have a lot of great role players out there. So just really going to do the best we can to try to minimize it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think the relationship between Jayson and Jaylen is natural. I don't think that they try to force anything upon one another. I feel like people do try to make it like a big deal, but honestly, who they are, they can be quiet at times, but when they speak, everything that they say is important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,And I think that their relationship is their relationship and it's been awesome.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I like it a lot better being on their side rather than -- rather than going against them just because I've been in situations where I've had to guard both of them in a series and it's extremely difficult. The way they play, the way they complement each other, especially being aggressive getting into the paint, both being great playmakers in the first game, balancing that with scoring and making everybody better I'm glad I'm on this side."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, for sure. He's probably our best defender, so hearing that is pretty empowering. Really all you're trying to do is make it as hard as you can on a guy like Luka. He's so good. He's going to make some tough shots even if you do play really good defense. You have to know its going to happen and just have to have a next-play mentality in terms of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"We were really connected last game, and we have to continue to be that way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"Just try to help the team win in any possible way and bring energy. I thought I did a pretty good job of that. You know, just got to continue to do that, and that's probably going to be my role throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,I work on it every day in practice. You don't really get an opportunity to shoot them in the game very often. I think I maybe had one or two throughout this season. But that one just happened to be the NBA Finals and people are making a big deal out of it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I don't know, I mean, I put the work in, and sometimes you get to showcase it like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I had a great community growing up that supported me and helped me, you know, get to this point for sure and had influence on my path growing up. It's pretty cool to have those people still reaching out, like schoolteachers, coaches. Obviously, my family and friends always have kept tabs, but it's pretty cool to have those people reaching out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"You've just got to be disciplined. My mom always says, just treat others with respect, and you're bound to receive that from them as well. Just treat everyone the same and put your work in. Don't worry about what other people say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I would just say he's like got a unique approach to the game. He pulls things from, like, soccer teams, pulls things from killer whales and how they go about finding food and prey, things like that, and he ties it into the game of basketball. And I think it's a unique way to go about it. It's different and cool and engaging."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,I'll let him. I dont really know how to describe it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I mean, nothing in particular. Just I didn't even do it before the game. It was more of something I could turn to when I need something to switch things up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,SAM HAUSER,"I feel like if you need extra motivation to play in the NBA Finals, you're probably in the wrong business. I was ready to go and get back out there and just got to continue, like I said before, just bring energy and help this team any way possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,First stretch of the game I tried to come up and tried to be aggressive and try to help my team. Just trying to put pressure and try to make possessions and try to find my teammates when they was open.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"No, he has not shown us film of his old playing days, but he does do a good job of emphasizing us playing with pace and pushing the pace and playing fast."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"I feel like the bond is growing stronger. We are around each other every day and we talk to each other, hang out and play games. I feel like our bond is really close."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"It's always good to learn from Sham. He's a good person. Always come here with joy and his background and history behind this game and with the moves Sham got, he just brought a lot of history to this game. You know, it's just good to have people like him out here helping us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,He's been telling us from the jump before we even got here that coming into this thing it was going to be a fight and staying composed and composure and sticking together. There are times when they go on runs in a game. So sticking together and staying together throughout their runs.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"And I feel like if we do a good job of doing that and going into Game 2 and playing with physicality and pace, we will have a good chance of winning Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,"To all the Mavericks fans that traveled here, we appreciate you all and we love you, and we are going to try to get this win for you all and go back 1-1 to Dallas with the series tied."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"Just staying positive. We've been in this situation before many times, just in this year. So I think for us just being positive and knowing how good we are as a team and just being aggressive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"The same way that happened in OKC and in the Clippers series, making sure that we stay together as a team. Look at adjustments we need to make, and we have done that. Go over film and look at the mistakes we've made and just make a positive from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"It was great. Everybody dreams of being in the Finals. That first bit of getting the jitters out. It's amazing, amazing fans. It was a great atmosphere and it's what basketball is about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. Our team is a very close team. Probably the closest team I've ever been on. It's a family. We have young guys. It's a young team. The guys, everyone really likes each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,I think that's what really helps our team is how connected we are and we are able to make adjustments. We are also able to talk openly about what we need to do to improve our game and how we can help one another.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,Not Luka. I don't know. Anyone but Luka.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"He does an amazing job. In his mind, it's another game. At the end of the day, we have one thing, and that's to win a championship. So I think he's done an amazing job of being a leader and a front-runner for this team. He's been a leader the whole year, and it really rubs off on the team and is contagious."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. I think being nervous is completely normal, especially for me. So I think just being here and being a part of it, it's fun. To me, being nervous isn't a bad thing. But at the end of the day, now it's time for us to make sure we are doing everything we can to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"We need to be more aggressive, and we need to be way more aggressive. Looking back at every single one of these playoff series, we've been the aggressive team. And, yeah, just communication-wise. Just small things can really help out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JOSH GREEN,"I just think how together we are as a team. Like I said, the coaches do an amazing job of reacting to situations. Going back to the drawing board. Realize what we need to do as a team and be able to show the team, and I think the guys are good at making the adjustments we need to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, I've seen a lot of things that we can adjust on and be better at. We have to push guys in, play inside the perimeter. That was pretty much just the main thing. Better transition defense and taking care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I have a lot of confidence in this team. We have always found ways to take that next step in the right direction, because we like having adversity and always came together instead of tearing apart. That's the main thing we focused on going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,We always get hit in the mouth in the first game. Leaves a bad taste in our mouths. We have to come out the next game to rinse that out.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,Just the energy around it. We know that there are things that we can be better at from the first game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much every day, just like after media. We are going to be watching film after this. It's always easy to sit down and go through the things that we can obviously do better and be better at. When it comes to the coaches, we always kind of like joke around here, like, oh, do it again. But this is what it takes to be able to survive at this stage. This is the last series of the year for us. Survival of the fittest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not necessarily. I feel like he took the right approach to everything he did. He was in foul trouble, but he stayed poised. A lot of guys, they will get in their own head, get aggravated, frustrated. He stayed with it, and that's something that shows maturity on his side just being a young guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just shows the better of the two sides. In the first half, we didn't really play good. We came out in the second half with our heads on straight. It just shows that we can take that step in the right direction, just put us in position to withstand for 48 minutes. We don't want to come out and just let anybody punch us in the face. We have to find ways to react the right way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,Be as physical as we were the first game. And just pray he doesn't make all his mid-range.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Really just have the confidence in our offense, making sure that we have poise and really just not getting sped up when it comes to the pace offensively. They are a scrappy team defensively. We have to find ways to get around that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think just be a little bit more aggressive. I think we all came out for the game with little energy. So I think we have to be better with our energy especially from the start."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"No, I don't think so. I mean, we talk about it, but we've just got to stay together. I think we talk about, too, we've got to talk more on the court than we did in Game 1. So that's got to be better from my side, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's big. This is the team that drafted me, and the team that believed in me. So I'm really happy to represent Dallas. Hopefully it's not the last time. But I think the whole Dallas fan base is proud of our team. So I'm happy to represent them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know, but I'm just trying to have fun. That's the game I love. That's the game that gets me paid. And nothing better in the world than playing basketball for your job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,So just trying to enjoy it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,I already knew it. Laughter.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,LUKA DONCIC,"Not yet. I mean, not since he was -- he signed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, it just depends on how fast we get the ball up the floor. If we are walking the ball up the floor and we start the offense at 17 or whatever, it's different from you starting your offense at 20 because you've got the ball up the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"So I think that goes into it, if you've got a little bit more time, maybe you can scan the floor a little bit. But for the most part, you want to kind of make quick decisions and keep the ball moving."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,I don't have no reaction.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I don't know. It's a team game. We're trying to focus on that, and, you know, everybody has their own opinions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,Say that one more time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, coming out even more aggressive but even more disciplined. You know, Dallas is a really good team, and they have responded very well to Game 1 losses. They come back in Game 2. So we're going to get a forceful, more aggressive team on Sunday, tomorrow. We've got to be ready because they are really good after a loss. So we can't be surprised, and that's what I'm preparing my team for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just trying to keep them off balance. They got -- they are here for a reason. They are well-coached. They do their roles. They perform their roles well. So can't give them the same look every time because they are -- you know, the more comfortable they get, the better they are."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,So just try to keep them off balance.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I remember it being a pretty cool experience. I see some young guys in our league now, like walking around and stuff like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's pretty cool when I was -- it was before I got drafted, like you said, and I was still, you know, fresh out of college and, you know, I knew some -- because I played at Cal Berkeley, I knew some of the guys on the Warriors. Steve Kerr's son was my friend at Cal. I went to a lot of Warriors games that season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"You know, I got to meet a lot of those guys and talk to a lot of those guys before I even got to the NBA. Mainly Andre Iguodala, who is like an older brother, mentor, to me now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, you know, those experiences were everything. You know, being able to see what a winning environment looked like. Being able to talk to guys who have done things at the highest of levels and then give you encouraging words and wish you well and good luck. That was -- that was my experience in the NBA Finals in 2016 or whenever that was before I got drafted. I think that's part of the reason why I was able to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But we've been just extremely focused on what our roles and our jobs are. We have all had to sacrifice. Jason Kidd has had to do that at the highest of levels, right, and I respect him and tip his cap for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Right now, at this point, it's whatever it takes to win and we can't let any outside interpretations try to get in between us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought the crowd was good. I think we can be a little bit better. So I expect us to be even louder. Sunday, we are going to need our fans to be hyped. It's not just team versus team. It's crowd versus crowd. It's gas station versus gas station. Supermarket versus supermarket. It's the whole city versus the whole city. We need everybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just watching film, taking your time. Seeing and reading the game. Being aggressive. Not hesitating. But also, you know, making the right plays. Like you said, being in the right spot. Spacing has a lot to do with that. Making sure our team is properly spaced, and then being aggressive from there. We expect them to be a lot more aggressive on defense, Dallas, coming out into this Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JAYLEN BROWN,So that's going to put an emphasis on us to be more disciplined. We have to get to our spacing well. We've got to make the right read. Got to take care of the ball. Can't do stupid fouls because we expect a great punch from them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"It's a little bit of everything. I mean, Joe kind of gives us the freedom to trust our instincts, and then you also know that, like, if someone gets beat, someone's going to have your back, and we just fly around after that. So just a little bit of everything and just competing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think, like, we just took a breath, stayed together, stayed composed, and just kind of got good looks offensively, moved the ball. We got good looks, and I feel like that close in the third was huge. Kind of just put 'em away, kept a distance. So credit to the guys that are out there just staying together, getting stops defensively, and making the right reads offensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, you never really know, coming back from injury. We just seen him -- all the hard work he's been putting in. But you, like, never really know, to miss all that time and come back for The Finals. But he was unreal today and it's nice to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we just won one game. We know they're going to be better. I think we have seen it in the playoffs this year. Like, they have lost Game 1's and they came back and played better. So just it's one game. We got to learn from it, we got to grow, and understand that we're going to need to play a lot better Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"He's a matchup nightmare. Even when you play good defense, he doesn't really see you. It's been unreal just watching him all year. Then defensively, he uses his size well, just impacts the games in so many different ways. He changes us and he makes us a better team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it can be anybody. I think it was JB that timeout. But Al, JT, Jrue. I can say, like, that's the great thing about this team, is if there's something that needs to be said, people are going to say it and we're willing to accept that and grow from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"So, I mean, it can be anybody that's playing. Like X Xavier Tillman has said stuff in the past that has helped us, so there's a lot of guys that have the voice and we're just learning and growing with each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, they're a really good team. They're going to make runs, they're going to make tough shots, they're going to -- I mean, they're going to make it difficult for us. We didn't expect it to be easy. I mean, I wish you could just stop it after, like, one point, that would be nice, but I think you just got to figure out why you're struggling and just try to limit those mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, JB'S unreal on the perimeter. I mean, blocking shots obviously he had two big-time blocks. He can just do everything on the basketball court and he has like no weaknesses on both sides. So, he's big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think anytime you go through something like that and all the experience that we've gathered through like the ups, the downs, like, all that has just helped us to be a better team. So we've learned from everything and, like, this core group has been together through a lot of adversity, so I definitely think it helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, those two are unreal, great players, great teammates, and they just do so many little things for us on both sides of the basketball, so it's amazing having them as our team on our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"It felt great. To be honest, I was nervous. I ain't going to lie. I was nervous in like an anxious way, as like a little kid. It's surreal being in The Finals. When you're young, I guess, in your career, you think you're always going to go back. Last year was kind of like a wake-up call when we didn't make it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,So getting back to this point and being here is really a big deal. We played well tonight. There's a lot of things we feel like we could do better. But it definitely does feel good to win the first game. But we know that two years ago we won the first game and the outcome of that series. So we still have a lot of work to do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, you always want to have your team at full strength. We're a good team when guys are down, but we're really, really special when we have everybody. I said it earlier, how seamless his transition was after being away for six, seven weeks, and coming into the game and having a first half like that, that was a big spark for us to start the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,Thanks for reminding me.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think you guys got a pretty clear picture of that throughout the season, when we were healthy for most of that and how we played and how effective we were on both ends. KP had a big hand in that and the success that we had this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Obviously, getting hurt in the playoffs, we had to figure it out. We had to adjust and play different lineups and whatever. 12-2 up to that point, we did a really good job. But it is a relief to have him back because we know we're a much better team when he's back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, and they go hand in hand. Al has stepped up into that starting role and at this stage in his career being a, you know, center piece of us getting to The Finals is something that shouldn't be overlooked. His presence out there on both ends of the floor, what he allows us to do offensively, dragging out the big men. You know, and we have had playoff games where Al has hit six, seven threes. Even if he doesn't, you have to, the other team has to respect him as a shooter, so it just helps with our spacing. So, can't give Al enough credit for the impact that he's had on this playoff run."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think when you look at JB, he's somebody that has really worked on his craft year after year to just become a better player. I think you can tell by the way that the game has slowed down for him and the way he's making reads on the offensive end. That doesn't happen just overnight, it's a process. And I've seen it, I've seen the work that he puts in and watching film and things like that. So it's special to see when guys put in the work and it translates to on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think just, being his teammate for seven years, we've been in so many big games, we've been in so many big moments, and just always being there to answer the call in those moments, especially on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"I think our offense got a little stagnant and it had a lot to do with our spacing. They kind of put us into some bad ways on offense which kind of threw off our spacing and slowed us down. They started to get stops, running in transition, but that's part of it. They're going to make shots. That's a really good team over there. We just did a great job of responding in realtime after Joe called that timeout. They cut it to eight, we came to the bench and talked about it, executed and made plays and took the lead back up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Just staying present, staying in the moment. Like I said, I was, in a positive way, I was nervous before the game. I was like a kid first day of school. I know how exciting and big of a deal all of this is, so just finding a space to enjoy the moment and have fun playing basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Something that we have harped on all season, what makes our team really special is we don't have guys that we hide on defense. Bigs and guards, we switch, we take on the challenge of individual defense. Understanding that we have help, it's a team sport, we all got to be on the same page, but we're not showing or anything like that, because that could kind of compromise your defense. And, essentially, like, if you want to play on our team you have to be able to guard, and everybody knows that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to say like -- I didn't doubt him, but I just, you know, coming off an injury and missing that much time, it normally takes guys a little longer than that, but as somebody as tall and talented as he is, he makes it look really easy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYSON TATUM,"Maybe last year, us losing in the Conference Finals. Maybe I just expected that after we lost in 2022 that it was guaranteed that we were just going to keep coming back, and this is like our time. Last year it was just kind of a wake-up call to not take anything for granted, because you never know how many opportunities that you might have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Thank you all for being here. I want to begin with someone who is a familiar face at the Finals, and that's Bill Walton, who we lost last week. Of course, Bill won two championships but also covered multiple NBA Finals for NBC and then ABC. He and his wife, Lori, often sat, as many of you remember, at these press conferences, usually somewhere over there. I'm thrilled that Lori Walton is going to actually be at the game tonight, and Bill's four sons are going to be here, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The Celtics team was looking for a way to honor him tonight, and in addition to a pregame moment, the Celtics players are going to be wearing a special Bill Walton shooting shirt. So you're going to be seeing these shortly. The guys are going to be coming out and warming up in this jersey. We're happy about that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In addition, Bill was someone who became a very close friend in the over the 30 years that I've been with the league. Many of you in this room have been covering the league for a long time, as well, and he traveled with us everywhere we went. I remember the first time we played in China, in 2004, being on the Great Wall with him. He was quite an adventurer. I can't think of a better ambassador for the NBA than Bill. He enjoyed talking to every single person."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Increasingly, internationally who understood he must have played basketball, wasn't quite sure who he was, and he would explain to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But even some of you know, right up until this past season, he was working. He was doing an alternate telecast with us called Throw It Down, and even Bill sort of continued to cover the game, couldn't stop complimenting the current players. I think he saw the staggering ability of these young guys and was constantly complimenting them. Every generation of young player came to know him. And just lastly say he'll be missed, and my condolences to Lori and his four boys. It's a sad moment in the league."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Speaking of NBA's international presence, I know there are 26 different countries represented here today with media members, so I want to thank you for traveling so far to be here. In addition, these Finals will be carried in 214 countries and territories. This group of players will represent the largest contingent of international players ever we've had in the Finals 13 players of the combined two teams were born outside of the United States. So the global growth of the NBA continues unabated."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Basketball as a sport continues to grow enormously on a global basis. Wonderful to see how much is happening in the women's game, as well, in the WNBA here in the United States, and we're looking forward to the Paris Olympics, where basketball will be a mainstay, men's and women's. Another exciting time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It was interesting, I was watching Luka Doncic yesterday, just an example of how international this league is. Of course, someone who grew up in Slovenia and trained in Madrid and Spain and was doing interviews in three different languages. Again, many of you spend time with him, but he's an exemplar of the modern NBA."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"And with that, I'm happy to answer questions. I only speak one language, unfortunately, so please in English. Thank you again for being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Well, just begin by saying I don't want to cover specifically on what's been written in the media other than to say, yes, absolutely. I would just say plural, where you say TV deal, it's TV deals. Of course, there's discussions with our incumbents and other interested parties."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It is incredibly complex. I look at my colleague Bill Koenig sitting in the front row, president of our media division, who has been literally working around the clock on this, along with a team of others at the league office. And it's complicated for several reasons. One is the advent of new platforms, particularly streaming, and the interest of streaming companies, and then the traditional media companies also carrying our games on streaming platforms."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It's complicated with multiple partners all seeking similar assets. In many cases, just figuring out the right way to balance those games as they go to different partners."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Then lastly, as you've said, we tend to do long-term deals. We think that's good for the stability of the league, but it means to a certain extent you're trying to predict the future, which is of course impossible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"So part of it is a bet on the partners that we will ultimately align with and their ability also to adjust with the times and their willingness to continue to invest in media and also become global, which to my earlier point is very important to the league, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Sure. The advent of Team Ignite, for those of you who don't know, a team of younger players playing within the G League, in essence a select team, was in response to both President Obama, then at the time in office, who was pushing us hard and the basketball community to create a professional track for players who were not interested in playing college basketball, and at a time when they were not being compensated for playing college basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In addition, it was the result of conversations with Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, who was overseeing a committee on behalf of the NCAA, who made similar recommendations and said that I think our view was that these young men should not be forced somehow to go to college, if the only reason they were going to college was in preparation for the NBA as opposed to preparation for life. Our response was, we hear you, and we created this Team Ignite program. We were paying these players directly."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think Team Ignite served its purpose. I don't necessarily think that the changes in NIL, legislation and these ongoing changes in college sports were a direct result of it. I think it helped, though, demonstrate the value for these young players, but we got to the point now with Team Ignite where frankly we felt it didn't make sense to compete against these top college programs, where in many cases have better facilities, top-notch coaching, charter aircraft, et cetera."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"We thought this was a good time to step back and reassess what our role should be in junior basketball. Not just with the G League, but I'll add I've had some discussions with Charlie Baker, the head of the NCAA, about the joint role we potentially can play in helping even at a younger age helping develop top-flight youth basketball, boys, girls, young men, young women, in the United States in particular. I think that is something that we should focus on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It's interesting, as you look at the growing body of international players in the NBA, Luka Doncic as an example before, who in essence went on a professional track beginning at 13 with Real Madrid, there's clearly some improvement we could use in the U.S. system for the training of these elite players. There's no doubt they come into the league as some of the most skilled players in the world, but in many cases they haven't -- it's not that they haven't learned team basketball, but because of the way the system works, they're constantly changing teammates, they're jumping from program to program. You can tell that the international players in many cases are just learning a different style, and in some cases a more efficient and winning style of basketball, team play basketball than we're seeing in some of the U.S. programs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"So I would add USA Basketball to the NCAA and the NBA and I'm sure that shoe companies have an interest in doing this, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Pulling back on Team Ignite was just the beginning, but I think as we complete our media deals, for me this will be, and Mark Tatum, Deputy Commissioner, is sitting here, will be one of our next major projects. So we're really focused on what our role should be in youth basketball in the United States and globally, for that matter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I'll leave the specific question about the foul to my colleague, Commissioner Cathy Engelbert. Other than as a fan, obviously it's nothing new in basketball that there's sort of ""welcome to the league"" moments, especially for heralded rookies, but of course I want to see Caitlin treated fairly and appropriately in the league."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I would say it seems like she can take care of herself. She's a tough player. I think it may be lost on some people that are new to basketball, in terms of a little bit of controversy in the WNBA, what an incredible talent she is two Final Fours, leading scorer in the history of college basketball. I look forward to watching her ongoing development in the league."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think ultimately this is very healthy for women's basketball and the WNBA. It's generating tremendous additional interest. In fairness to the other players and in fairness to Commissioner Engelbert, this didn't just start this year. Certainly we're seeing an acceleration of it with Caitlin, but many individual stars who came in this league in the last several years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"And then, again, I've been with the league for a long time. So I was there in the early days with Val Ackerman, and of course David Stern, when we developed the WNBA. In some ways, to me, this was a long time coming. If you went back and looked at our original business plan from 28 years ago, we didn't think it would be such a long timeline to break into the popularity we're seeing now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Ultimately, I don't want to make too big of an issue about one particular player, one particular call. But I think the burgeoning rivalries within professional basketball, you see rivalries obviously among clubs but also among individual players, too, and I think that can be ultimately good for the sport."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But at the same time, there's also some larger societal issues at work. There's no doubt. I don't want to hide from that. Some having to do with race, and they're very apparent. I think sports historically has been a platform for people to talk directly about these issues. I don't think we should hide from them, and I think the players are happy to engage on these issues. They're sophisticated people. But ultimately let the public join part of those conversations, as well, and of course the media will weigh in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Well, part of it, I don't want to sound overly confident, it has much to do with watching where media is moving, where top-notch content now that we're seeing on the various streaming platforms, the fact that maybe Netflix being the latest in terms of their Christmas Day deal for NFL games, that many of these platforms that only six months or a year ago that were reluctant to come to premium live sports are now jumping in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"If you watch where the eyeballs are going, and I'm sure it's true for people in this room, as well, we're all moving into watching premium programming on streaming services."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Also, part of where my confidence goes in moving sports over to streaming platforms and something I've talked about before, it allows for tremendous additional functionality when it comes to watching games, personalization, customization of games, multiple feeds, multiple dialects, multiple languages, different camera angles. It really gives the fan enormous additional choice that you don't have through traditional television."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Trying to predict how fast this will move is I think what's so difficult. I think there's been a faster decline in cable viewership, cable usage and viewership than people were predicting even only two years ago, and the move is happening fast to streaming services. So what we're trying to do as part of these television deals is middle sort of the use still of the broadcast platform. Of course, the Finals are on ABC in the United States. Still matters tremendously to us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Traditional cable, it's not going away, but it's continuing to decrease. And then streaming platforms are seeing accelerated growth, particularly around premium live sports. We're sort of trying to put foot, hand, finger in sort of every one of those buckets."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of what Dallas did last year, we sanctioned them. We did what we thought was appropriate at the time. I would only say that the success they saw this season, that they're now seeing in the Playoffs and here they are at the Finals, I don't attribute it to one draft pick, as important as that draft pick has been to their team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Look, I'd say Pat McAfee, that's what you're referring to, he apologized, and I accept that. I think that the way media works these days, when people are online for hours, they're going to occasionally misstep. I think what's important is the context, their intention and sort of what they're willing to say about having done that. I leave it to ESPN to make their own personnel decisions about what the consequences of things like that. But I accept sort of in a free society, where there's a lot of conversation, a lot of dialogue, and I think it's for the WNBA, of course, it's going to be a two-edged sword."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Many of us in this room go back to David Stern, where we sat in meetings and he was pleading with some of the very reporters sitting her to cover the WNBA and women's basketball. Now we're being covered, and once you get covered in an extensive way, it's a little bit of a product of how media works these days, that you're going to see occasional statements that people aren't happy with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I think that my sense is at least what I read, the player accepted the apology. I think in the context of how he said it, I think matters a lot these days."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I don't want to get into sort of the cliched cancel culture debate. But I worry about that, that sort of this notion that if somebody seems to be a person of goodwill is saying things that in the context seem actually supportive of the player but says a word like that, that we all say shouldn't have been said, and he's the first to acknowledge he shouldn't, I don't want to overblow it. I think that we can move on from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Bill Koenig, can you tell me when the media deals will be over so I can begin the expansion process? Laughter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In all seriously, I meant what I said. We do need to finish up -- I think I said a few years ago, collective bargaining agreement, new media deals, then we would turn to expansion. So we got part one done clearly, and thank you to the Players Association. We are very happy, I think both sides are, with our collective bargaining agreement."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I'm absolutely fine with that. It's interesting, times change. There used to be concerns even geographically of players from a certain part of the country and how will they feel about that player in that market, because the player played for a top college somewhere else or from somewhere else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think it's increasingly a global league in that wherever that player is from, and Luka Doncic is a great example, Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee, I think if that player becomes part of that community, lives in that community, gives of himself or herself in the WNBA to that community, I think they become part and parcel. I don't think it's any different that I went to Duke University and when a player is playing for Duke and Duke fans are all in, they're not so focused on where that player is from, whether in the United States or Luol Deng or other players from outside the United States."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It's a global market. At the same time, I will say to my earlier point, it is important that we focus on proper development of American players. I just think for the sport, still we're a U.S.-based business, the majority of our revenue still comes from the United States. I feel an obligation to the game, as well, and I know I speak for the head of the NCAA, who played college basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Over time, like for example, we're up to about 30 percent of our players are international. When you think about the amount of basketball being played globally and the U.S. is a little less than 5 percent of the global population, that number of international players will only rise. Statistically, you're going to see more top-notch international players in the league. It doesn't mean, though, that there won't still be great U.S. players, many of whom we're going to see on the court tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It has been difficult. That show in particular is special. I have a close relationship with everyone who's on that show, from the time they played in the league, as well, and Ernie and I have been friends forever."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"At the same time, it's not just the talent, of course. You've been in production yourself. There's hundreds of longtime people who have been involved with what I still refer to as Turner Sports, who have been longtime friends and colleagues, and no different at the other networks."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"On one hand, from the league standpoint, it's fantastic to be liked and to be wanted and to have multiple suitors. At the same time, it makes me uncomfortable that it's zero sum, that at the end of the day there's only going to be so many television packages, there's only so many Finals games and playoff games and regular-season games to distribute."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I will say directly from me, directly to your question and the people who seem to be most impacted right now, the folks at Turner Sports, I apologize that this has been a prolonged process, because I know they're committed to their jobs. I know people who work in this industry. It's a large part of their identity and their family's identity, and no one likes this uncertainty. I think it's on the league office to bring these negotiations to a head and conclude them as quickly as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of the last part of your question, we're not considering right now opening up control of teams to institutional capital. We think it's still very important that there be individuals and ultimately a singular governor who has ultimate decision making for a team. We've seen examples historically where, putting aside institutions, there have been multiple individuals, and it's led to all kinds of contention and controversy. So I don't see that happening, at least in the foreseeable future."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of institutional capital being invested in teams, in some ways it's a good problem to have, as you said, as the value of these teams continue to grow and grow at a fast pace. There are only so many individuals literally in the world who can cut those sort of checks to invest in the majority of capital required to purchase these teams."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"So we think we've found ourselves in a pretty good spot where you have individuals with control pieces of team, other individuals who are investing alongside of them, but then to complete the cap chart, you have institutional investors. The institutional investors, of course because the values are going up right now, seem very pleased with those investments. I think historically we were concerned, before we allowed institutional investors, that they would be short-timers and that they would be looking to quickly flip their investments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"We haven't seen that. In fact, this is your area, not mine, from the Financial Times, that it's become more sort of permanent capital in a way as opposed to being short-term investments. The investment community is looking now at sports teams, particularly premium sports teams, not just the NBA, as an investment category in a diversified portfolio that in many cases moves in an alternative ways from the market as a whole. It rounds out a portfolio and it seemingly is working well for everyone right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Lastly, I'll just say that this policy is only a few years old. Institutional investors who don't comply with our current policy, some particular funds have been in to see us, and to say we would like to be an investor in your league or in teams, and would you consider adjusting some of your policies, not necessarily to allow us to be a control owner, maybe they would like that one day, but in other ways, to ease up some of the restrictions, and that's something that we'll continue to look at. By the way, I know the NFL is looking at some of these same issues right now, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"First of all, as you said, that's an ongoing process in terms of the arbitration. That was a process they agreed to in the purchase agreement. The league office is completely independent of that. Yes, the next step, were they to win that arbitration, would be then to continue through the league vetting process, and then ultimately what would be required would be a vote of the Board of Governors to approve them as owners."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The only reason I won't comment on that is because that would be obviating the entire vetting process that needs to continue, and then is ultimately for the owners to take that vote."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"It may impact things if we were now at the point where they had won the arbitration and the group was being vetted for ownership. But as far as I know, and I only -- I don't have personal knowledge of that deal, I read it, as well, that's independent of the issues that are now at issue in the arbitration."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"When it comes to injury data, we're constantly studying it, trying to see if there's more than correlation and there's actually causation. Of course, this past season, even though we had the 65-game rule, largely designed to keep star players on the floor, we had a decrease in injury in star players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I'm not standing here saying one followed from the other. It just may be happenstance for this season. I think we saw injuries, of course, in the Playoffs this year, but nothing that out of range with injuries we've seen in the past."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I think, look, there's nothing more important than keeping our players on the floor. One of the things I know Andre Iguodala and I, it's great having him now as the head of the Players Association, just based on his experience as a star player in this league, a championship-caliber player, that we're trying to step back and say, what is it that we need to do to incentivize guys to play and keep them healthy, and are there things we need to adjust in the schedule, are there other areas. You're talking about the Playoffs now that we look at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"I will say just based on one season of data, we're happy with the 65-game rule. There was sort of a parade of horribles that had rolled out, that had been rolled out, that everybody was saying, were threatening were going to happen. Those things didn't happen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of not just a reduction in star player injuries this year, but it worked to the extent we saw star players on the floor more. That was the goal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Whether there's some connection in terms of additional injuries and Playoffs, we don't know. This is an area that confounds us in some ways. I will say that we worked with the players successfully in the collective bargaining agreement on this issue, and I think with Andre's leadership, sort of a commitment on both sides, let's keep looking at it. We have the same incentives, and that is to keep star players on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Fair question. It's where we should be able to make the most progress. As I've said before, you're always going to have human error in the case of referees. It doesn't mean we can't continue to do a better job training officials."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But when it comes to technology, again, it's one of the things we've been talking to the Players Association a lot about and the Referees Association, too, and I'm thinking once the season ends this year, maybe we even put together a task force of the constituent groups. A guy named Evan Wasch in the League Office is leading this initiative. We're in discussions with Hawkeye, the technology they use in tennis. As I've said for a while, it's harder than I understood it to be, but if there's a category of objective calls that you can not only take off the floor but frankly out of the replay center. Buzz, Celtic ball, because it's automated, foot on the line, which one of the hundred fingers on the floor touched the ball last at that time. As I said they're working through that. But technology will solve that, and I think it's the same for replay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,I'm not going to get into that only because it's a complex legal issue.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think obviously what helped me is just even from the walk out before the game and then getting on the court, getting that kind of support was unreal. The adrenaline was pumping through my veins and that definitely helped. Obviously it wasn't ideal that I was out for such a long time, but I did everything I could to prepare mentally for this moment coming back and it paid off and we got the job done tonight and had a good game and happy about the result."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, from day one I came here and I said like I'll do whatever it takes to help this team win, right? I think it was -- this situation, you know, it made sense. I didn't care. I didn't care. I knew I could prepare to come off the bench, which is something different for me, and that's what I did and stepped into that role and embraced it and had a good game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no. Yeah -- what was the question? Laughing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, at the end of the day, it's like, it's just basketball. It's okay, it's high intensity, it's like more -- you know, like, intricacies of the game and stuff, like, more focus on little details. But at the end, it's just basketball and I've been doing this for a long time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Even if I have time off, I can jump right back in and I feel the same way. I get to my spots and I do, so whether it's playoffs regular season or whatever, I know how to do this. That's it, just having that confidence, going out there whatever, first round or Finals, just going out there with full confidence and giving what I have to the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know, even when that first quarter when I checked in and start things going my way and stuff, I didn't even think about it. I was so in the moment and enjoying the moment and the crowd and everything, you know. I don't know, it's kind of like a blur to me right now. I have to re-watch the game, what happened and stuff, but I was completely just in the game. That's the best feeling. Like, I had the most fun and, yeah, and I hope to have more of those moments going forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not in a sense of, like, am I going to be okay. Like, it was only like physical. Am I going to be good to go physically, not -- skills-wise, there was never -- at least for me never no doubt. But of course, you have ups and downs throughout the game, like all this stuff happens, but mainly for me, it was to get there physically and once I felt pretty good and the medical staff had my back and we did everything correct to get to this point, then they gave me the green light, I was good to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, we had a conversation and just came up to me, I know he knew I was going to be fine with whatever, you know, so he just told me, what do you think, like about this, and I said, of course, like, let's do it. And that's it. Wasn't no big deal and I trust Joe and he trusts me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know, but Joe always gives us the right message, you know what I mean? He himself is very almost -- like, he can be emotionless if that's what we need and he can just come in, like, completely even keel and give us the right message of what to focus on. And then he can come in and give us some motivation if that's what we need in that moment, some energy. But I think there he was just even keel and giving us some of the answers to what we need to do out there and that was it, we trust him with his leadership."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, a little bit of everything. A little bit of everything, right. It's tough to not play for a month and then jump into the highest intensity game in The Finals, it's obviously very tough. But as I said, I did everything I could to prepare for this moment, like mentally, and then just going out there and playing instinctually almost, you know, and trusting my body. And that was it. And as I said, like the support around me was great to get to this moment, and now, yeah, we just have to keep going and take care of business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just thought it gave us the best chance to win. He was great on both ends of the floor, defensive execution, game plan, playing for a spot in the offensive end, being physical, and making plays on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just poise. They have a great defensive system, great defensive team, throw a bunch of stuff at you, different spacings, different coverages. The poise to just figure it out. Make the right play is going to be the most important thing. I thought he had that throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, game management is going to be important. This is a great team. They have a tendency to go on great runs. That's going to happen. You have to be able to manage those with poise and execution, know why those runs are being made, and quickly put a stop to them with high-level execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"So KP was a huge part of that, that run. But I liked the way we handled their run, because that's going to happen. You're not going to stop that. You just have to have the poise and the toughness to work through it and I thought our guys did that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"What you saw tonight is kind of the challenge he took for himself coming into the year. Not wanting to be defined by one thing. Wanting to make plays. Wanted to be a well-rounded player and get better and better. So his spacing, his ball movement, his defense on ball and off ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Usually when you give up a run and your offense gets a little stagnant, your defense goes with it. Tonight our defense kept us in it and that's really important, to have that defensive mindset. Some of those plays that Jaylen made were a part of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think a couple of great passes. JT stuck out, the one Jaylen threw to Al in the corner. I think it was either Jaylen or JT. But that's what those guys do, they have the ability to draw two guys and the most important thing is making the right play over and over again, doing what's best for the team, reading the two on ones, and when they're at their best, those guys are able to do that. I thought their decision making helped control the game, especially when they went on that run and we were able to get that back. We went back to -- with JT there and he was able to help us sustain that with a high-level execution, so that's really important when those guys do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I always talk to the players about what we think is best for the team and that it's that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know. I can't remember.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"The one when they cut it to eight? Yeah, listen, it's the NBA Finals, you're playing against a great team and they're going to make runs. Just building on awareness to why the run was made and, you know, that team does a great job of making defensive adjustments on the fly and sometimes it takes us a possession or two to recognize that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"So just understanding the run, what could we do to change it, and how can we get better coming out of that. So I thought the guys' poise out of that timeout was big and that's going to happen. They're going to go on more runs and we're going to have to fight through 'em."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, again, I thought our defensive mindset, our defensive execution, our defensive game plan, our positioning, we had the right intentions and I thought we played really physical, for the most part, defending without fouling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"And on the offensive end, we made some physical drives, and so that's the key there, is just having the physical mindset on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I know the story line has to be, what's he going to look like because he was off for a month, but that's what he's been doing his whole career. He's a great player. He's been great for us. The reason why we are here is because of what he's done. It doesn't matter how long he takes off, the guy is going to make plays because of how talented he is and the work he puts in. What he did for us tonight was big and we need that for the rest of the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Um-hmm, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Out of the three minutes, two and a half of it they're by themselves, so I'm sure -- they communicate well with each other, they have great relationships, so I'm sure during the time the coaches are meeting that they're having that communication with each other. They do a good job of communicating with each other throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just sticking with the game plan. Game plan execution's very important. Having a clear understanding of what you have to take away on every possession, and just knowing that in order to defend these guys at a high level, you have to play efficient offense, and I thought we did that for the majority of the game, obviously, on the run. There weren't many live ball turnovers and we missed some open shots. They forced us into a couple tough shots, but we were able to manage the transitions of the game with our offensive execution and our defensive game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, they're going to make a lot of adjustments and they're going to do a lot of great things because of the talent that they have, so we have to execute the game plan, communicate coverages, communicate matchups, guys did a great job communicating to each other and keeping defense first."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Just great individual defense. Everybody has to take on the challenge of guarding those guys. They're an amazing team and they put a ton of pressure on you with their ability to score. Everyone is going to take their matchup personal, have personal pride in individual defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,He's not on a minutes restriction and we haven't gone through that yet.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Same thing he's done for us all year. Defense, offense, communication, play hard. Just what he's done for us over the course of the season that's helped us get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, Jaylen is the kind of guy that just works hard, has a chip on his shoulder. I would say everything is motivation for him. I enjoy watching him when he works. He has a huge growth mindset and he's going to look to dig deep into weaknesses that he wants to get better at, makes his strengths better, never skips a detail."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"I would say he's one of the higher-motivated guys I've seen, just the way he works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"No. We just talked to the staff, just Celtics, practice, getting better, and that's it really."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Honestly, same way every game day has looked. It's no different. We've got to rebound, we've got to sprint back, we've got to play defense, pay attention to detail. We have to pay attention to spacing, we have to execute, we have to crash. We've got to play hard. I can honestly say it hasn't looked any different, and the things that will go into winning this series are no different than the things that we talked about in preseason, habits, mindset, details, execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Same as they were first game of preseason, got to go out there and play. There's a game plan. We've got to be ready to execute it. But there's going to be adjustments, variables, things you're going to have to go through."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,In the short time I've been around I've been in some big games. The things that go into winning and losing are still the same. We can't be distracted by anything else. We've got to make sure we stick to those details. That's the most important thing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's all the fundamentals of that are the same. You have to communicate. You have to build relationships with people. You have to have a great staff around you. You have to have great players. You have to get those players better. You have to empower people around you. You have to know whatever level you're at what goes into winning and what could lead to losing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think no matter the level, it's all the same, and obviously each level presents different types of challenges, but you rely on those things that can be translated regardless of where you're at to help you, and it's the people around you and the way you can build relationships."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great player. They have a great team. There's no one way to guard these guys, especially when you have to play them over again. So you have to be open-minded to go into different things, absolutely."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,"But the game is connected, so the offensive adjustments we make will be in large part by how we defend and our defensive adjustments we make will be in large part how we attack, and the game is connected, and those decisions are made by kind of those things, how one thing affects the other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,But I don't anticipate one solution. You have to have multiple solutions.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"I thought give the Celtics credit. They did a great job defending, making it tough on us. We had some good looks that didn't go down. We've got to move the ball. The ball just stuck too much. And we'll be better in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he had great looks that just didn't go down. He had some great looks at three. He had some great looks in the paint. That's just part of basketball. Sometimes they go in. Sometimes they don't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Tonight, they just didn't go down for Ky or most of the team, and hopefully we get those same shots in Game 2 and we can be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, KP was great, he knocked down shots. He changed shots. He blocked shots. He gave them a spark when he came off the bench."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,We've just got to make it a little bit tougher on the offensive end. We've got to make him do something different. He got great looks and knocked them down.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we did cut it to eight and got the rebound and unfortunately came up with a travel. A lot of good things in that third and fourth that we can build on. That's what we talked about after the game and that's what we have to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We came out and won the third. Had a great opportunity to cut into that lead. Unfortunately, they go on a run. Once we cut it to eight, but then you know we won the fourth. So there are two positive things that we can take from these four quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We've got to be better in the first. They took advantage of that. They knocked down threes. But the big thing is, we have to be better as a team offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,They did great. They did great. And they will get better as the series goes on.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is the best team in the NBA and they are good for a reason. They play their style of basketball at a high rate. They generated 27 threes there in the first half, and made I think 11 of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,So we have to be better. We can't give them seven made threes in the first quarter. That would have outscored us with only scoring 20.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So we have to be better. Give them credit. They were good tonight. But again, we've got to be better. Nerves or not being in this situation, we can't use that as an excuse. It's just basketball, and we've got to be better at the game of basketball on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought the group handled it well. At halftime, we talked about what we had to do, and I thought we did that coming out in the third. Again, cutting that lead, getting it to eight with the ball. Unfortunately, we traveled."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"And then from that point on, they took control of the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But I thought the group responded. I thought we were better in the second half, and hopefully we can build on that third and fourth quarter going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"I think it's just about the positives. What can we do to build on the positives. We'll talk about that tomorrow. Understanding the small things, the physicality. We have to be better at that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But just looking at the positives. Looking at the things that we can control, and then we'll build from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We talked about it at halftime. I thought we weren't having fun there in the first half and we talked about having fun, to work the game, to continue to keep playing. There's a lot of time. A lot of people will talk about one game but we are talking about a series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So the bigger picture is to continue to keep working in the series and I thought the guys did a really good job there in the third quarter. We get the miss. We get the rebound. The momentum is going our way. Unfortunately, we traveled."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So we just have to be better. We know that. Boston is a really good team, and so we've got to be better on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's a great number. Also lets you know that the G League is doing the right thing. The development of the G League and being able to have those players participate on the biggest stage."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Again, 22? That's a lot. That's a great honor, and hopefully one of them can have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Well, you're talking about the second-best defense. We saw the best defense in Minnesota, so now we're going against the second best. Understanding they have a lot of great defenders one-on-one, so we expect that they're going to continue to throw different bodies at Luka and Ky. Those two as our quarterbacks have to be able to read who's guarding them and then being able to get the right guys in the pick-and-roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"We truly believe those two will make the right decisions, but when you talk about individual defense, Boston is one that will read a lot of the pick-and-rolls but also in isos just play one-on-one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think there's a lot of different paths. I'm happy when you talk about Hurley being mentioned as a candidate, JJ being mentioned, two different paths that could become head coaches in this league. Both basketball IQs extremely high. Whoever the Lakers choose, it's up to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But when you talk about championships, Hurley has won two at UConn. I've gotten to play with Hurley in high school. He is a warrior. He's a champion. Coaching runs deep in their blood in that family. So if he was to become a Laker, that's incredible for him and his family but also for the Lakers."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But JJ also has a basketball IQ and understands how to play the game the right way, and so either candidate is going to be great for the Lakers to choose from, but the path, there's a lot of different paths. Mark Jackson set the path for us, whove gotten older, who could not move, to figure out what we can do next."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"So when you talk about the path, Mark Jackson set the path. I'll always thank Mark privately that he gave us old-timers a chance to do something and still be involved in the game at a high level, and so I chose that path and I got lucky that the owners believed that I could do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I haven't really thought about that -- 2011, at the end of that game, just understanding what -- there's no one else to play. We're playing our best basketball, and being rookies, we didn't really know how to celebrate winning a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But when you sit there and you digest the situation of understanding that you just won a championship, it's just surreal because as a kid that's what you dream about. As a kid, you're watching Game 1 Boston against Dallas, and that's all you're working for is to be able to win a championship because you want to be like Magic, you want to be like Mike."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"To be able to do that in '11 was incredible. It's something that I will always treasure. That group of guys that we're linked to with Rick Carlisle as a coach, who led us was incredible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,It's no different than the Western Conference stage. It's basketball. It's just a little bit more of you guys.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But to embrace, as I talked this morning before we started talking about Boston, was the guys who get all the attention or most of the attention, share it with the younger guys who aren't getting interviews. When it is time for them to get interviewed, they know how to handle it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"I just shared that with the team this morning, to understand Ky and Luka, this is also a great time to share how to handle things with the younger players because a lot of them haven't been in this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,Luka has been in this situation since he was born. Ky has been in this situation for a couple times now. For those guys to be able to share it with them is my message.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"The basketball message is it's basketball, to have fun and embrace it and enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Ky and Luka as our quarterbacks, the respect that we have for one another, understand we all three have played the same position. Those two are a little bit more gifted than I am."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"The trust for one another for Ky -- myself, I've known Ky since I played in New Jersey, to see his journey, he's a champion. He's won, and now has us back into the Finals on the biggest stage. He's always enjoyed this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"He always gets to celebrate his birthday first, even though we're born on the same day. But just to understand what he's gone through, that you can grow from different situations, and he's definitely done that, and he's really embraced Dallas, and he's playing his best basketball yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Al's journey, it's been incredible. It just seems like he's getting younger. He's been on great teams. He's always been a great teammate from afar, from what I've heard. Just understanding his skill set, being able to guard everyone on the floor as a teammate, being able to also stretch the floor, being able to shoot the three, and so longevity, he's doing something right when you talk about eating and taking care of your body and also mentally, because it can become draining. It can become where maybe I want to get on with my life and do something different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"But again, his goal is to try to win a championship. Our goal is to try to delay that. But again, he's going to be one that's going to have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they've seen every coverage just like Luka and Ky, so we've got to be able to change it up. We can't give them a steady diet of one thing. They'll pick you apart."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JASON KIDD,"Again, when you get multiple bodies on the ball, that's when the three comes into play. Hopefully we can stay out of that situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"We didn't perform the way we would have wanted to tonight. It starts with me just being able to get out there and get us settled. Got to take some accountability for just the communication, and just going out there and getting used to the way that the kind of environment was going to be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But I think my teammates did a great job of staying together, sticking to the game plan. We obviously made some mistakes, like I said, but we gave ourselves a chance in the second half and we just have to continue to do the right things and win the quarters as much as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"They came out and hit us in the mouth early. Got the home crowd going into it. Down 17 in the first quarter. It's not really like us to give up 37 points. It's happened to us before in the playoffs, but we just wanted to make it a lot tougher on them. They hit a lot of threes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, when you get them rolling like that, they play a very easy game the rest of the game, and we've just got to hit them in the mouth a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"They did their job getting Game 1, but we are going to take our lessons and get ready for a good Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I don't necessarily agree it's a trap they want to set us. I think that they really rely on their great defensive ball pressure and one-on-one defenders. They funnel us into certain areas. Even as I say that, they are relying on the one-on-one, every time I got an iso, there's almost two, three people waiting for me to get in there. I have to catch the ball on a live dribble and just be aware of my opportunities."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's uncharacteristic for us to have only nine assists. The ball has got to move a little bit more. And again, that starts with me just being able to push the pace, get us some easy opportunities, and just adjust to what they are throwing at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"So just going to be replaying some of these possessions. But at the same time, looking at some of the positives that we can carry on to Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's basketball at the end of the day. You know, being in this environment, I'm used to it at this point. Early in my career, there was a different relationship that I had with Boston and just being able to come here, be settled with a veteran group. Now I'm here as a veteran, over the past few years, just experiencing the playoffs here, even regular season, it's been the same thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I thought it was going to be a little louder in here but I'm expecting the same things going into Game 2. Crowd trying to get me out of my element, my teammates out of my element."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But again, the energy has to be focused towards the game. I felt like I had a lot of great looks. They hit back rim or were just a little left or right. Just got to stay confident and stay poised throughout this, man. This is the best time of the year to be playing. There's only two teams left. Let's put it in perspective."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,The environment is going to be what it is but my focus is on our game plan and making sure my guys feel confident and I feel confident and continue to shoot great shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Very proud of them and amazed at how poised they are. This younger generation has a quiet confidence and a knowing about themselves. I think when we hit a little adversity, we have to know how to respond as a group and as a team. We talked about it in a lot of huddles but we have to act on it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what this game is about is controlling our actions, making sure that we stay positive, but also know what we are going up against, the competition level. We are the best in the world at this point. There are only two teams left. We have proven why we deserve to be here and we've earned our right to be here. It's no time to see ourselves as a short opponent or someone that's not capable of coming out of this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's Game 1, but at the same time, we've got two days in between. So there's going to be a lot of noise and a lot of who played well, who didn't play well, who was under pressure. Just telling my guys, now is not the time to fall into that and be divided and be on social media all day listening to people that are not on the court with us. No disrespect to anybody but we are the players out there and we have to control what we can control and be ready to put on for each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just settle in emotionally and just continue to pinpoint the things that were working for us where we are funneling their guys to where we want them to go and offensively playing off a live catch. They do a good job of loading up when we are on the dribble. They do a lot of reaching, a lot of verticality, effort. We have to give them credit. We are going against a great team and now is the time to just look at film, spend the next two days healing up and just getting ready for a physical Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, just look at film and then also be ready to wash our hands of what this game was and how we didn't rise to the occasion to start off the game. Just be able to battle with them during those runs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"They are going to make some threes at times but we want to make them tough. When they are at home, they shoot incredibly well. We knew what we were getting ourselves into but until we experience it, then we wouldn't know."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"This is the first time this group is experiencing the Finals. We don't want to use that as an excuse. We want to use that as a strength. We want to use that energy that we have of just going into it and playing our game to our advantage, and then, you know, we'll see how the chess pieces fall in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it's not the first time I've lost in Boston. I don't want to continue to make it a habit but they've had a few games over me and they have our number -- not our number, I don't want to say our number but the past few teams I've been on, they have had my number a little bit. You have to give credit to a good team. They have been good the past three or four years."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"We want to show them respect but at the same time we want to bring our best game. We have to play four of our greatest games in order to win the series and in order to win the Finals. It's not about holding our heads up for one game if we didn't play well. It's the first to four and we obviously know that, but we have to play four complete games, four of our best games, and then we'll see where we stand after that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But in the meantime, we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and it starts with me as one of the leaders on the team, how can I be better and how can I be more poised in this environment. It's not the booing and it's not the missed shots. It's more or less our attitude and how we approach possession by possession. Our identity has been made on the defensive end. We have proven that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I have not had the best games offensively this playoff run but we have been able to get stops, timely stops and been able to pick each other up on the offensive end. We have all-world talent on this team, skillset is out of this roof, but now it's just about remaining confident and always knowing that you have somebody that's been through it but now it's our turn to go through it together. You know, this is what makes it exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, yeah, it's hard to compare just because you're going against different players, different series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But I will say that the next day was pretty cool, you know, because to see us still joined together in practice, still go through our day-to-day routines and rituals, and just hold each other up and hold each other accountable but in a very healthy way. We are very honest about what we can continue to do better and then we are very honest about how we can coach one another to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"We are going to hear the familiar sentiment or familiar phrase that a lot of guys haven't experienced the Finals on our team, and that's okay. Experience is the best teacher, and once you get Game 1 out of the way or Game 2 out of the way you start feeling better about the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But when you lose Game 1, there is a level of disappointment. We are human. I've always said that. We are going to feel the natural emotions. You feel the highs and lows of the journey but when you lose a game like this especially in the Finals where everyone is watching, it's going to hit you a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"But again, like I say, now is the time to not get on social media and not pay attention to what you guys are saying, no disrespect, but we've got to go out there and just focus on what we can control."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,I just know how the next two days are going to go. It's going to be very loud. It's going to be very chaotic at times. People are going to have words to say about how we can be better and how we can win or lose the series.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Again, it's about us focusing on what we can control in that locker room, and we have great leaders in that locker room. So it's not just me who has that the experience that I'm going to be leaning on. I'm going to be leaning on everybody to help me out, too, as I help them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,It felt good. I think the whole key for us was to come out and defend home court and establish ourselves and we did that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,"Everyone was really locked in on the defensive end. The things that we needed to do, we just wanted to be very solid throughout. KP got to an unbelievable place there early in the first half, in the first quarter, and I just felt like it really got us going and took us to another level as a team. That was huge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,"It was great. I was pleasantly surprised to see how good he looked. He was very fluid and a lot of energy and moving well. We know he can score, but defensively he looked really good as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,AL HORFORD,"I mean, weve kind of known. At the end of the day for us, we understood what the mission was in front of us and what we needed to do. Everyone here was on board."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,"It feels good to win. But just know that the jobs not done. Never getting too high, too low. Just knowing that weve got to win Sunday and then two more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we set the tone early. That kind of gave us the lead and then when they made their hit, they got it within eight, we could withstand it and push it back up to 20. So we did a good job of just being poised."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,It takes a lot. Lock into the game plan. Two great scorers and playmakers in Luka and Kyrie. It takes a lot. It takes a full team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,Him being him. It was good to see it. You see him go out there and have fun. He brings energy to the game. And how he plays is so fun to see. Glad hes on my side.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think Jayson is just being Jayson. I dont think there is any pressure that he cant handle, on or off the court. But I think on the court, I think him being able to play-make, almost having a triple-double and being the best player on the court is what he does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Im pretty sure. Everybody was ready to go. Its been a long stretch before we had this first game. We finally got that out of our system, so now we should be able to play for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,Of course. This is something that we can learn from and it can help us in the next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,Not necessarily difficult shots. We just have to communicate a lot better and just be better in our principles defensively. Thats what's going to help us withstand the stretch of the runs they made.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, he looked pretty healthy to me. We have to find a way to match his energy and physicality."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,They mostly play one-on-one. They send a lot of help. So that's why.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Of course. You want me to say we have no confidence? Smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Of course.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, he was great for them. He was knocking down shots. He was blocking shots. So he was really, really huge for them on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Their spacing is great and they have a lot of shooters. So I think we have to do a better job taking those threes away.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,Just like I said right now. We've got to take those threes away. That's what hurt us the most.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Just playing our basketball. I think in those moments, we were playing our basketball. We were getting stops. We didn't allow them to offensive rebound. We were having fun out there those couple moments, and that's what we've got to do more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Obviously this is a bigger stage. But those games, Finals prepare you for this moment. We pass Game 1. We didn't do our job well. So we've got to focus on the second one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"Just focus on the next game. I think we really got good shots. We just didn't make them. But we've got to go game by game. The Game 1 is over. We've got to watch film, what we did wrong, and focus only on the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, obviously, I think they are the best three-point shooting team in the NBA, so sometimes really hard to take those away. Especially when they have five guys out and they can all shoot. Obviously, we've got to make more. We didn't make enough shots today to beat them. But we've got to be better on both ends."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it's a full-team effort. Luka still had 30 and 10, so I got to do a better job. But it's a full-team effort and tonight I got lucky a few times, but we got to get ready for Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think defensively I thought we were -- we made some big-time plays. When they cut it to eight, that's when the game started. I liked how our team responded. We stayed composed. Offensively, we got to our spacing and was able to push that lead back out and make some plays on offense. That was a big third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"What was I feeling? Just trying to make some plays, get my team going. Defense is what we got to hang our hat on. Right there, that was an example of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"It just depends. It just depends on who you're on, it just depends on the spacing of the game, and we got to be able to make plays, and right there, it was just -- I was the low guy, I was on some of those bigs, you don't want to give up lobs. That's one thing that we made an emphasis on. So I don't want to step up too much and give those lobs, but I was able to cat and mouse a little bit and then make some plays at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the game right there. It's going to be -- it's not going to be perfect. It's a long series. I expect them Game 2 to come out with tremendous force and maybe try to hit us in the mouth. So that's the game. When a team goes on a run, you got to manage it, you got to stay composed, and you got to keep playing basketball. It's almost like you just have short-term memory a little bit, like the team's not even on a run. You got to play smart basketball and make great plays to get us on a -- get our flow back, and I think in that third quarter, I got to the free-throw line. I think that helped us get going. Then we made some kickouts to the corner. Al got a three. We was able to get some good offense going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"But getting into that paint, being solid, being composed was what allowed us to push that lead back out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"We just said, just breathe. The game is starting now. Just breathe. We're in -- this is a moment where our experience shines through. Just breathe, just keep playing basketball. If you got a shot that's open, take it with confidence, no turnovers, take care of the basketball and just play our game. We got to get some stops. They made some big shots. Just navigate the run. That was it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Two great additions between Kristaps and Jrue. In any given night it could be any of us. And Kristaps had a monster game for us and just his presence shooting the ball and then him being able to attack those switches and mismatches, he made 'em pay every time, and that's what we need going forward in the series. Kristaps was big, but those other guys, Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, JT, they all can get going at any point in time, so that's the beauty of our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Every game has its own story. We just got to stay ready, stay composed, and take it one game at a time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yes, I think Kristaps has been great for us all season long. I think he's a big reason why we've been the best team in basketball record-wise, at least, and having him back and him playing well and to that level he was during the season is so important for us because you got another defender, another shooter, out there that you have to respect. So that just opens it up for everybody else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Now, next game, I'm sure they will make adjustments. We got to be able to read it on the fly and make plays. Guys got to step up. We need guys like Sam, Payton, to come in and step up, JT. Everybody got to be ready to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,It means nothing. You just get ready for the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just trying to get to the paint. You know, get paint threats. That creates openness for our shooters. Just get to the throw free-throw line, take my time, and knock 'em down, and clean it up for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"But overall, that's what I've been doing all season long, is just getting to the paint, and that just opens up -- that puts a lot of pressure on the defense. We got a lot of guys that can shoot the ball. Making those reads and stuff is big for us, so got to continue to maintain that throughout the season, throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"It was amazing. Nobody's more proud and more excited for him than I am. But we got to get better, we got to, you know, almost forget about it and get ready for the next one. We can't be celebrating ourselves. Dallas is probably getting ready for the next game right now, so we got to prepare and get ready for the next one, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, was it the first or second quarter? He just went on a run where he just, he hit the three, hit the middy, then ran back, got the block at the rim in transition. He was just making play after play and it was just like, all right, he's back, there was no question about it then. We need some more that have going forward for the rest of this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,They're two of the most talented guards this league has seen. It's going to be a challenge for all of us. It's not going to be one-on-one we all have to participate.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,They're two of the best this league has ever seen. It's going to be a lot of fun. Just have to embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,Pray they miss laughter. They're special. They make tough shots. You just got to try to make it difficult for them for 48 minutes and embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"You got to know the personnel. You're just competing. We've been switching a lot all year. Whoever has that challenge, just got to know that it's not just you on an island we're all going to be there behind them. Just embracing that challenge, competing and trying to make it as difficult as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, obviously there's a lot of history between the two. I think once we get in between the lines and the game starts, it's just going to be a competitive game. We're just going to go out there and compete. I know he's going to do the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think at the time we didn't have anybody who had any Finals experience. So obviously we've learned a lot from that Finals a couple years ago. Obviously adding KP and Jrue, all the experience they have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"I think it's going to be different. Everybody is looking forward to it and embracing the challenge. This is the NBA Finals, it's what you dream about. It's going to be a challenge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"I think everybody's excited, honestly. It's been a long break. A good week of practice. Everybody is looking forward to it. Like I said, this is what you dream about. Whatever it takes we got to be willing to do. We've been working for this moment the whole season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,Yeah. It's going to be here tomorrow. It's going to be fun. There's going to be a lot going on. A big challenge and have fun with it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"We didn't want to skip any steps the whole season. Obviously, the outside noise is going to be there no matter what we do. So this whole year we didn't want to skip steps. I think we did a really good job of that in the regular season and the postseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"Just continue to take it one day at a time, one game at a time. Just understand there are going to be ups, there's going to be downs. Just embrace it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, you're here, you see all the banners, all the history. It's in our practice facility. You just dream about being part of that. Obviously the great history that the Celtics have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,I think we all just embraced it and are thankful and grateful to be a part of this organization.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"This is what it's all about here in Boston, this stage, this moment. We understand the challenges of it. We're just looking forward to it. We're going to have fun. There's going to be ups, there's going to be downs. We may lose, but we got to go out there and compete each and every night. Whatever it takes to get four wins."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's crazy. This is like the biggest stage in basketball. To reach this point, have the opportunity to come out here and perform and help my team win the championship, it's an honor. Hopefully we can get it done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I would have the belief in myself that I could do it. I always dreamed of being in the NBA. I knew I worked really hard to make it. So I guess in a way, yeah, I believed in it. It's the only reason I would work every day like I did, I had the belief in that dream, so yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I wasn't here when Kyrie was here but there's no bad blood. I think a lot of the guys that played with him have admired the way he plays the game. I definitely admire it, too. I take a lot of things. The way he plays basketball is very beautiful. He's an unbelievable player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,There is no bad blood from us at all.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think it's the nature of Boston and the NBA. When a player leaves like that, fans and people can be frustrated. I think at this point we should just realize how good of a player he is and just give him his flowers for that aspect of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just helps that you've been through it. I think the difference this year, too, is we got a little bit more rest going into this series than the last time we were in the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Just kind of the circus with the NBA Finals, the media, everything that comes with it. So just going through it realizing what the routine is going to be like. That helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Just in the basketball game, I don't think it's any different necessarily than the playoff series we played before. Same thing, we getting up and down. Definitely helps, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think we have to realize they're unbelievable players, and we're going to try to make things very tough for them. You're never going to completely stop them. We're going to do our best."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"That's easy. The reason I fell in love with basketball in the first place is I watched Dwyane Wade win his first NBA Finals versus the Mavericks. I was really young at the time, I might have been seven, something like that. I can vividly remember watching them come back and how incredible he was that series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a huge moment. It's an honor. It's a blessing. It's one of those things you dream about, think about every preseason, every season, every postseason, every offseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"To be here now, it's something special. But just got to stay locked into the moment to be successful."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a special place to play, especially an NBA Finals. I know the energy is going to be insane. Their fan base is one of the best, for sure. They're going to support their team. We're going to feed off the energy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,There might have been a few moments when I dreamed of the future to come back here like this. It's cool to be back here. Back then was a whirlwind. I was trying to survive.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"He's a special player. Presence around the rim defensively, obviously can shoot from very deep. With his height, it's hard. Adds an element to those guys that we can definitely key in on and take into account. Scoring threat."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"As far as his time with us, we're going to compete. At the end of the day, we are good friends, have a good relationship. Looking forward to battling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,I'm not sure which story you're talking about.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Very brief. I think he's wearing the 77 very well. For a guy like him, I think it's very fitting to have a unique number. As one of the most unique players this league has seen, this game has seen, for him to have the number that kind of stands on its own, it's very fitting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Feeling good. It was a long road to get to this point for me. But feeling good. Looking forward to today's practice, moving around a little bit more, then being ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Of course, of course. Burns inside of me, you know, not being able to be out there. But tomorrow finally I'll get the chance and I'm excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, no, not cautious. I mean, no. I've came back from multiple injuries. I've had these first games back, of course not at this stage. At the end it's just basketball. Of course, the intensity is a little bit higher. I have to go out there and play like it's a basketball game, an important basketball game, and that's it. I don't need to think too much or, yeah, overthink. Just go out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, I'll play tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, it's good. It's always been good. Yeah, as I said, he's one of the best players in the league, in the world. It will be a tough challenge for us to try to stop him. Just following his career when he came in the league, already made a huge impact. I had the opportunity to play with him for a couple years, get to know him. Just knowing what type of person he is, what type of player he is, his mindset, he's a special player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,We have a big challenge ahead of us competing against somebody like that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no, I mean, I did everything, right? You have to check all the boxes to even get to this point. Of course, as I said, you cannot imitate the same intensity in practice as it's going to be tomorrow in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I have to feel confident to go out there and leave it all on the floor and expect that I'm going to be healthy and completely fine.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, obviously it's been tough. No, I've never felt like I'm not a part of this. I am a part of this. I've tried to be with the team, like, in any capacity I could. Guys so far have been, like, playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up. Al has been unbelievable for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I just look forward to add more to complete the mission."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's going to be goose bumps, for sure, especially not playing for a while, then coming back in this kind of environment. It's going to be special. Going to be goose bumps, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I'm really, really, really looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not all of it was, like, not good, right? We had some good moments. We had some decent moments. Yeah, overall I think it didn't work for both sides. It wasn't perfect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"But, like, I would say everything, teammates, locker room, I know at that time there were some rumors there's like something in the locker room. It was never like that. It's all just noise at the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It wasn't just perfect for us playing together, it didn't work out, that's it. We moved on. There's no, like, ill will from their side, for sure from my side. I don't think there should be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,Just didn't work out. But I have nothing but love for Dallas and for the teammates and for everybody there.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think he makes everyone's life easier. One, because of who he is as a person, the type of character he has. Your franchise player has to be a cornerstone of what you do. It starts with his high character, the way he carries himself, who he is as a dad, who he is as a teammate. His availability. He's there for every single practice, every single game. Loves being coached. Just carries himself the best way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,There's no one like him. He's great.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Right away. I think just all he cares about is winning. He's used the experiences he's had around the league. He's seen a lot, he's seen it all. He's seen success. He's seen tough times. He knows what the league is all about. I think at this point in his career, winning is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"But it's both sides, right? He had to do his part to fit in, but we had to do our part as a team, guys that have been here before, meet him where he's at because of his ability to play at such a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,So I think it was just both.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think it's more like the things that lead to success are the same. You're in locker rooms, regardless of the sport, even if you're in a company, everybody is saying the same thing. The things that go into winning, the things that go into success Toughness, togetherness, connectivity, the mindset you bring. It's all the same. It's just a matter of getting the right group of people in the right spots, then just working to feed that mentality every single day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,You can learn from anything and everything. You're trying to stay as open-minded as you can.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, every year he just has the open-mindedness to get better. So if you have that, you're naturally going to be different. But also, like, from the first time we were there, he's been through other stuff. He's been through success, we've been through failures, we've won, lost, had pain, triumph. You use the things you've been through every single year to make yourself better on and off the court. That's kind of where we're all at as a team, using those goods and bads to use us for where we are right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he can process information. He can process situational basketball. He has an awareness of what's going on on the court. He has innate ability to communicate that in real-time because of his ability to just kind of take that all in. Who has the ball, who has the matchup, where is the help, what's the spacing, who can you help off of, when can you make a play. He has great instincts. That allows him to communicate at all times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I would say this is not the end of the journey. The journey is for however long you're alive. This is just one piece to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,Regardless of what happens you got to wake up the next day and do your job. The journey will forever be there.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"You're just ready for it. You do everything within your control to prepare for it, mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. Tomorrow you just get after it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"The game, the environment will tell us what we need to focus on, what we need to get better on and what we need to do. The most important thing is staying on a even keel and staying with poise. I think that's something our team has done a good job of doing all year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I had a good seat, great perspective in that. I think the biggest thing you learn is what goes into winning in the NBA Finals is the same as the last series, series before that, regular season, preseason, practice, training camp. It's the details, the execution, the ability to take your mindset and your body to the next level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,The toughest team will win. The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"The biggest thing we took as we were going through that series against the Warriors, the things we kept coming back to were the things we kept talking about the entire year - the margins, details, fundamentals, the way you go about executing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's not the only moment that those guys are using to get better. The coolest thing about where Jaylen has been is his surrender to anything external and the most important thing is his growth and development as a person and as a player. That's all he cares about, is getting better. I think that's been really cool to see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,I think it's the same for Jayson. You can pick numerous experiences that everybody in our locker room has been through that you need to be able to use for the situation we're in now. That will remain the same for the rest of our careers.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think it's all about using what you've been through good, bad, indifferent, to help you in the present moment. The guys are doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, unless they change the light bulbs in the arenas, they won't be any brighter than they were the last series. It's just sticking to the details, the things that matter, the truth. The truth of the matter is if you don't box out, if you don't sprint back in transition, if you don't pass the ball in a two-on-one, if you don't take away the other team's tendencies, if you don't know who you're guarding, don't recognize the spacing, if you don't talk, if you don't play hard, you're not going to win. Focusing on the most simple things and the truth, the truth of the matter is you have to do those things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"You have to do them at a high level. Obviously the stakes are higher, that just means that the details are more important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, everybody in the organization is a leader in their own way. Everybody sets the temperature when they come in. Brad giving me my start, hiring me, empowering me from day one as an assistant, giving me some of the opportunities that he has. But also the way he carries himself. I've always had a lot of respect for how he went about coaching, how he kept family balance number one. How he treated people number one. That was always more important than whether there was a success or a failure. I think he spearheads the leadership, the temperature of the building, just as everybody else does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"A whole lot of trust, just a whole lot of communication. In life, you could think someone has your back, but you're never really going to know unless it happens in game play. You get blown by, you see your teammate putting his body on the line for you, makes you just want to do that much more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard not to, right? Got to be able to adapt to every situation you're putting yourself in. Whenever you're shooting, doing layup lines and stuff like that, you turn around, there's 150 people with cameras, all you got to do is just smile away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard to treat it like every other game because there's a level of urgency. We're more focused on each and every individual fact that we can, no matter if that's defensive coverages, offensive game plan, what we need to do to come out and throw the first punch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's definitely been a journey, man. I feel like it hasn't even been a year, but it feels like three. I feel like I've matured, I've grown up, and I've grown a lot as a person and as an individual."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding I'm going to get them into their spots. Whenever they have three people on them, you just got to understand put yourself in the ability where they can see you, and they going to get the ball to you because they're always going to draw two or two and a half people."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's just finding little holes in the defense and slowly being able to not be as aggressive but try to get them open so they can get you open, and you're going to get your shots. It's not always going to be me, people in the corner open, people at the top of the three that's open. Just be able to move the ball and find the right shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,It makes you play with a certain level of aggressiveness and freedom. You put your life on the line out there. You put your body and your soul on the line in this 94 feet so you can win a basketball game. We're talking about basketball. Are you going to go out on the court and be scared of anybody because it's a basketball game? No.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like there's a lot of things in life, a lot of fears in life that I've had to meet over this past year, and it's caused me to be that much more confident in myself, being in such a tight-knit, intense moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like the Boston Celtics has always been a franchise that has a lot of respect, has had a lot of talent, has had a lot of people come in and left their mark here. It just makes it that much more of an experience for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"Their voice is law. If you're on bullsh-- they're going to call you out. At the same time, they have the same respect for you if they're on bullsh-- and you're supposed to call them out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like they both act younger than me off the court. They're both joking, joyous, trying to put a smile on everybody's face. But whenever it comes to on the court, there's a certain switch that they turn on. You can see it in their eyes. The kill mentality, just go out there and hoop, go out there and get the best shot, go out there and try to be the best basketball player possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"It's not game day yet, but it's obviously very special to be here. This is what you dream of, just making it here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"As a team, we have our ups and downs during the season, but we deserve to be here. We want to take advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Theres a little bit of a history, so I think it will be very energetic. But that's why we are mentally prepared. We just have to keep the composure, focus on ourselves, what we have to do. Play with the same energy that we had in the last games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"The days off obviously helped. I had a little bit more time to get treatment in and work on strength and everything else, also on conditioning. Overall feeling great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, it's the Playoffs, so there's limited time. You get back and get the amount, the reps, practice. But we did a great job I think of ramping it up before that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Also the minutes were kind of restricted, too. We tried to make the best out of it. It's not ideal, but it's what you got to live with. I think we did a great job overall of pushing with the right pace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think especially after winning the Western Conference Finals it's a thought that you have. Now its really game to game, you can't get too excited because it's a lot of ups and downs for each individual game, for the whole series. You just got to stay locked in and prepare the same way for every game, keep your composure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"No, it's just like to stabilize it a little bit, some comfort for the shoulder. Nothing to get adjusted to, or change. No big changes here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"I think every series that we play prepared us a little bit for that because we had other lineups against Minnesota where they had five guys that shot. I think we have a really strong defensive core now, with Gafford and Lively playing big. I think they're also doing a great job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Overall we have so many defensive possibilities, lineups that we can throw out there, without having big disadvantages."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"It will change a little bit because they play a little bit more five-out. Obviously, the rotations, defensive rotations, will be a little bit different. That's why we worked on it for a long time. Hopefully we can just adjust to it in the game tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"No, when you talk about it didn't work, did it work, I only had him for a short period of time. I thought it was going well in the sense of our defense, his ability to block shots, rebound."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Then offensively we looked to post him up a little bit more than Rick Carlisle had used him in the post, which was strictly on the perimeter shooting threes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Both worked. He has the skill set to do both. As you know, in the business of basketball, there's trades that take place. We're judged if it works or doesn't work. That's just part of the business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"For the short period I had him, I really enjoyed KP. Great, great on the floor, great off the floor. Did everything we asked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Again, his game, when you talk a big who can put the ball on the floor, who can score, I believe can play in the post. In today's game there's a lot of threes, not a lot of post-up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Well, you said that, Eddie. I did not smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"We believe he's super athletic. But when you talk about basketball IQ, everybody has different levels. When you look at Luka's level of understanding the game, time and score, who's on the floor, he is at the head of the class in that sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think you do have to experience it. I think that's the nicer way to accept losing, is that you have to go through it. It's a graceful way to accept losing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But you do have to, again, go through defeat to understand that bad taste, how do you feel, how does it make you feel, to work on your game, to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"There are times when you're just not good enough. As a player, unfortunately with the Nets, we played the Lakers, we weren't just good enough and we got swept. There are some cases that you run into Shaq and Kobe. You got to just take defeat and then move on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"We did bounce back to come back. But I think you do. Jayson and Brown have gone through defeat. We also lost to the Warriors, too, that year. The Warriors are really good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But they learned something. You could see they're playing at a high level right now, winning 64 games, the best team in the NBA. To be penciled in at the beginning of the season, that puts a little pressure or stress because you're supposed to be here. They fulfilled that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But that tandem, they're playing at an extremely high level and we got our work cut out. But they've been here. Some of us for the Mavs have been here, some of us haven't. We're going to embrace that and find a way to hopefully win a series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"It's simple talent. Sometimes you don't have enough talent. As I brought up the Lakers and Nets, we were happy to be there, but we just didn't have enough talent to beat Kobe and Shaq. It could be that simple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But nerves sometimes play a part, too. Just the human side of things. But at the end of the day, as much as we've talked about it, to embrace it, to stay steady, and to enjoy this time because you're not promised anything to come back the following year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"To do everything, this isn't a vacation. This is a road trip in the sense of a job. We have an opportunity here to find a way to win on the road. That's how we're approaching it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"This is the best of the best at the highest level. It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I did. Is that the first question smiling? Oh, God, I love it. Got to love this, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I have a great reaction. It's appreciated. There's a lot of gratitude there, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Definitely miss him. Playing out there, just making things easier, being able to run up and down the floor, just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air, as athletic as they come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other. Off the court, our families meshing well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I definitely think about those times. Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him, some of the great teachers that have come before me. I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Shout-out to LeBron for that. Knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to the future and getting this series started now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it is a fleeting feeling, to be real with you. There's so many peers of mine that have spent long years in the NBA trying to make it to the NBA Finals, Western Conference Finals, Eastern Conference Finals. Have gotten very close or almost struggled or strived every year to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I had a chance to do it in my fourth year, my fifth year, my sixth year. When I look back at those memories, never regretful of how I treated it, but a little disappointed on how I approached just that success. I wanted to be able to enjoy it and take a breather, really take in the moment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"You're in the middle of a 76-year history. I'm in the middle of a 76-year history now, but then we were in years of history. The NBA is very young still as a business. When you ascend to this level, put in a lot of hard work, you beat some of the best in the world, competing with some of the best in the world. I looked at it as, oh I'm going to be here every single year. At this age I've been through what I've been through, been able to come out on the other side. I look at it as an opportunity that I don't want to take for granted. I want it to last as long as possible emotionally just because of how much it took to get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship. So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that. I'm just very real, very honest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what's helped me grow as a leader, accepting what I can't control, and what I can't, letting it lay to the wayside. Letting that go, how it's going to go, that's life. Basketball has been a great teacher for me, but life has been an even better one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Using those same principles I've learned in life apply to basketball has allowed me to connect to my teammates better. There's no silent treatment that's coming randomly throughout the year because I don't know how to emotionalize or vocalize how I'm feeling. Some of the things I struggled with as a young player, I've now been able to accept this is what comes with being in this position. Taking on the pressure. Then also teaching my teammates how to get through it. Also look them to teach mere."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Just staying a student and enjoying the craft, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, shot out to God Shammgod. He's been imperative in just helping me grow, enjoying the game every single day, competing. I feel like he's just one of my uncles just from Harlem, New York, that's there to give me a little s--- when I need it but be honest all the time. Remind me this is bigger than basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Shout-out to God Shammgod. He's helped me a lot this year, been there every single day to help work me out. Also inspire the next generation. He does it in his own way. I'm just following his footsteps, just like other uncles of mine who have done great things in this world."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, I've experienced Boston twofold my first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, then being right down the street in Brooklyn, now being here in the Finals playing against them in a potential four-to-seven-game series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"You just got to breathe through it. To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Then the first question was? Oh, playing against my former brothers. Yeah, no, I'm excited. They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,This is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year of putting in the time to prepare for moments like this.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"Just really excited. Just excited to be in this position. At the beginning of camp, that's all we've been talking about, being in this position again. I'm just grateful. Right now, just trying to take this experience in of the Media Day, per se. It's just a fun time, a fun time for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"I'm enjoying it. This is a part of it. I feel like the first time we went through it, I feel like it was a bit overwhelming, just a lot going on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"This time around, I feel like we all understand it a little better. I'm very appreciative to be in this position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, just continuing to stay consistent in the things that I did, coming in, working out individually, doing our team stuff when we needed to. It was just for a longer, extended period of time. Staying really locked in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"I think the first day I took a day off right after Indiana, Game 4. After that, I just continued with my routine, continued to stay ready, taking advantage of the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"For me, this time off, I feel like it's been good to get me as prepared as best I can for tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"It's great. He's obviously a very big part of what we do. Just everything that he brings on the floor. He's a threat offensively. As we know, he shoots it, he can post, he protects the rim for us. It's just a really good thing for us to be able to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,I'm excited. I know I'm excited. I know our fans are even more excited. It's the Finals. They're going to be rowdy. They're going to get after it. 830 start. I'm just happy. I can't wait until tomorrow. I can't wait to see them bring that energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"I think it's a thing. I think so. I think being in this position, this situation, everything we have to manage, it can be overwhelming your first time dealing with all this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"The good thing about playing for the Boston Celtics is that the expectation is always there. When I came here eight years ago, this is what I came here for, for these kind of moments. What you say is pressure, nobody is going to put pressure on themselves more than we do, more than I do individually myself. I'm just really excited for this opportunity."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I mean, I feel like he's looked good. Kristaps, he's more of a gamer. I know when the game comes around, if he says he's playing, he's going to be ready to roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You do your best to stay away. Your mental health is probably the biggest thing, especially playing in the NBA Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But not only that, I mean, everybody gets scrutinized, right? When I was in Milwaukee, it was about Giannis not having enough help the first two games, whatever. The pressure that J.B. and J.T. have to take on is something different. I've told them this before, but it's really impressive how they handle themselves, how they stay professional, how they still come out every game and do what they do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think it's extremely impressive how they do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,Pray smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"No, I think it's just familiarity. Just I think knowing each other's game, doing your best to stay in front of him, trying to take away the things that will probably hurt you the most. Probably most of all having help. Him being able to see multiple guys on the court, making it look like it's crowded, making shots as tough as possible, even though he's a tough shot-maker, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think he's always been great, to be honest. I do think play-making, he's done a really good job, and that's something I never really saw from him before. He's never afraid to take the big shot. He's never been afraid of that big moment. I think making the right plays in moments is something I've noticed since I've been his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"One thing, the talent. I know sometimes talent doesn't always mesh together. This does. You saw it during the regular season. You've seen it throughout the playoffs, how any given night everybody is just unselfish. I feel like we sacrifice for each other. That's kind of what makes it go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Then I think it's just the will to win. I think this team really wants to win. I know they've been to the Eastern Conference Finals a million times. They've been to the Finals. They've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Now that we're here, we want to get the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"He never wants to sit out. He never wants to sit out. I've played with a lot of players. When you have your best player who wants to play every single game, takes the game that seriously, even if they're banged up with an ankle, knee, whatever it is, still goes out there and plays, I think it shows a lot. Not only him as a basketball player, but his character, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not for me. I would just like to add to it. I think to be a part of history would be cool, especially a history that the Celtics have and everything that comes with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Again, I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But to add to that is I feel like a part of the reason why I was brought here, the part of reason why I wanted to come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I saw something or somebody told me said they started from the bottom, literally at the bottom, now they're at the top. That's really cool to see, especially playing against both of 'em during the season with their previous teams, seeing their role, how it went for them, then watching them in the Playoffs, being intricate, huge parts of why their team is so successful."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,It's really cool to see. They definitely are energy guys. They're guys that mesh well with that team and really make them go. It's going to be a challenge for us to stop them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,THE MODERATOR,"Thanks, Jrue."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You do your best to stay away. Your mental health is probably the biggest thing, especially playing in the NBA Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But not only that, I mean, everybody gets scrutinized, right? When I was in Milwaukee, it was about Giannis not having enough help the first two games, whatever. The pressure that JB and JT have to take on is something different. I've told them this before, but it's really impressive how they handle themselves, how they stay professional, how they still come out every game and do what they do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think it's extremely impressive how they do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,Pray smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"No, I think it's just familiarity. Just I think knowing each other's game, doing your best to stay in front of him, trying to take away the things that will probably hurt you the most. Probably most of all having help. Him being able to see multiple guys on the court, making it look like it's crowded, making shots as tough as possible, even though he's a tough shot-maker, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think he's always been great, to be honest. I do think playmaking, he's done a really good job, and that's something I never really saw from him before. He's never afraid to take the big shot. He's never been afraid of that big moment. I think making the right plays in moments is something I've noticed since I've been his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"One thing, the talent. I know sometimes talent doesn't always mesh together. This does. You saw it during the regular season. You've seen it throughout the playoffs, how any given night everybody is just unselfish. I feel like we sacrifice for each other. That's kind of what makes it go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Then I think it's just the will to win. I think this team really wants to win. I know they've been to the Eastern Conference Finals a million times. They've been to the Finals. They've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Now that we're here, we want to get the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"He never wants to sit out. He never wants to sit out. I've played with a lot of players. When you have your best player who wants to play every single game, takes the game that seriously, even if they're banged up with an ankle, knee, whatever it is, still goes out there and plays, I think it shows a lot. Not only him as a basketball player, but his character."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not for me. I would just like to add to it. I think to be a part of history would be cool, especially a history that the Celtics have and everything that comes with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Again, I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But to add to that is I feel like a part of the reason why I was brought here, the part of reason why I wanted to come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I saw something or somebody told me said they started from the bottom, literally at the bottom, now they're at the top. That's really cool to see, especially playing against both of them during the season with their previous teams, seeing their role, how it went for them, then watching them in the Playoffs, being intricate, huge parts of why their team is so successful."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,It's really cool to see. They definitely are energy guys. They're guys that mesh well with that team and really make them go. It's going to be a challenge for us to stop them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's pretty special. Trying not to take it for granted. Not everyone gets this opportunity. So just trying to make the most of it, especially being on the path that I've been on. It's been like a wild ride almost. But it's been cool. Just trying to cherish every moment. You never know how long it's going to last."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Like I said before, I just try never to take it for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"There's nothing like tangible that I switch out in my workouts or anything. It's just trying to stay confident, maybe going back and looking at highlights where I'm on a heater or something like that. Just to know that, like, I'm still the same guy, it's just shots aren't going in sometimes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"It happens to everybody in this game. That's why you play the game of basketball. That's why it's a team sport, not just an individual sport. I try to impact the game other ways. Obviously shooting is the loud impact that I make. But I always know that water finds its level. It usually regresses to the mean. Shots are bound to start falling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Sometimes I just search up my name and watch the first couple videos that come up. Sometimes when you're in a hole or a slump like that, you just need something to bring you out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I think we're just excited to get going. I think, I don't know, it's been eight or nine days since we played our last game. Everybody is anxious to get back on the court, play in front of these fans. I know the Garden is going to be rocking tomorrow. We're excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, well, I think we all had a goal at the start of the year. We wanted to be at this point. I think each day we just treated it as its own entity, not look too far ahead."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"We knew we had the talent, but it's more of like we got to go show it and prove it. Now we're here. We definitely celebrated getting back here, but now we're laser focused for tomorrow. Hopefully going to come out on top this time as opposed to two years ago."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,This experience is amazing. I look at it as a blessing. A lot of people play their careers and never get a chance to play in the Finals.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,I would never take this for granted. I'm just super grateful to be here. Can't wait to get started.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Kyrie has helped all of us, those going through this the first time. He told us to just stay in the moment, lean on each other. We're all brothers. Just being there for each other. Stand together, stick together, trusting each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, that experience was super fun, to have the opportunity to go out there and play on the highest stage in the Playoffs, be able to perform. I was super grateful. I want to thank God for all of the blessings that He's blessed me with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"All that confidence comes from hours in the gym, late nights, just having confidence in my abilities. When I go out there, I feel like I'm confident in my ability to go out there and perform."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"I don't look it as an underdog. I feel like we have a bunch of guys that are hungry, I would say that. We have a bunch of guys that are hungry and ready for this moment. We're not going to take this for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"I feel like with the pace we play with, I feel like with our bigs, how athletic they are, I feel like we have good depth with our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, I think about it. I've been thinking about it every day, how these days just keep approaching. It's getting closer and closer. I'm just super excited to get out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, it's going to be a lot of energy in this building. It's probably going to be hostile. We already know what is expected. We going to come in hungry and ready to fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"This is awesome. I've dreamed of this opportunity as a kid, my whole life. It's something you work for. I think being here now, it's amazing. It's bright lights. I think the guys are ready to go. It's been our number one goal since the season started."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"I think the history says it for itself. Like I said, everyone is excited. It's one of my favorite places to play in the NBA. I'm looking forward to it. The rest of the guys are, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"I think we obviously respect them a lot as a team. They're a great team, coached amazing. I think everyone we faced in the Playoffs has been a great challenge for us. I think it adds to that. It's exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"It's weird, man. Looking back at it, it's crazy. There's so many times in my career, whether it's high school, college, it felt like everything was going the wrong way in life. Especially my first couple years in the NBA."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"To be able to reflect on this and see where we are as a team nowadays, it's super fun. It's exciting. It continues to motivate me. I still feel like I'm young in my career. But, yeah, it's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, I knew I'd be on it in like in 2K or something or playing My Career as a kid growing up, always dreaming of being in the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"But I think it's hard to say I knew I'd be here. Where I come from in Australia, Castle Hill, you dream of stuff like this. Pretty sure the little me would be very happy with myself. I would say I worked very hard to get where I'm at, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, the atmosphere is amazing here in the regular season, so I can only imagine what it's going to be like tomorrow night. It's going to get the adrenaline going. It's going to be exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"He means everything. Kyrie has been an amazing leader for not only me but everyone else on the team. He's competitive. Since day one, all sights have been on making it to the Finals. It's not only Kyrie. Kyrie is a great leader. Luka is a great leader. All the team has been so tight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Being confident and being pretty much prepared for anything, 'because nine times out of ten I'll be out on the perimeter a lot more defending. Just being comfortable in that situation. There's going to be times when I'm out on the perimeter, in the paint, protecting the basket. There's going to be a lot of stuff thrown at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Being comfortable in that situation, being confident I make sure I make those reads and being able to rotate defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmm. Just coming out, setting the tone. We got a lot of energy around this team. We got a great atmosphere around this team. If we come out with our heads on straight, I feel like it's going to be a pretty good situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"What's crazy, when I got traded, we were actually headed here to play Boston. I got to the practice facility. Wizards General Manager Will Dawkins called me and said there's a possibility you'll be going to Dallas. I said, okay, let me know. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes. He called me and said, You've been traded to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I would say when it comes to the emotions of getting traded, you could be mad, you could be happy. I would say I didn't really have a crazy reaction to it because I've been in the situation before. I just took this as a point, one door closed, another door opened for me. So this is another opportunity for me to kind of like progress throughout my career."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I just wanted to make sure I most definitely took the right approach to it. I didn't really want to think too much on it. Like I said, it's another opportunity for me. I just took this as this is another step down my path of success."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, man, the first game when we were there, Luka threw the first lob to me. The crowd went crazy. The Dallas crowd reminds me a lot Bud Walton Arena when I was in college, for sure. Just being in that atmosphere like that, love and energy throughout the arena. It's just something that I felt like I missed just throughout my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much the same. Go out and stay confident and comfortable when it comes to just like the position we're going to be in defensively. Offensively, not letting them speed us up. They got a lot out of veteran defenders -- Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, he's around the basket blocking shots. There's a lot of guys that are guards that can block shots, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Honestly, one of the best human beings to be around. When I got here to now, just seeing how he carries himself, how he talks. One of the best people to be around. He embraces everything he's been through, and he's found ways to just improve and progress from that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I've heard him talk about when he was here, transitioning to Brooklyn. He said he learned a lot. It takes a lot of just like humble and humility just to go through something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I would say he's one of the best people in the world to be around, because everybody has had some type of situation. You see me at my worst. You never pay attention to just like the progress of how I'm trying to better myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Because we are players. That's the main thing, in my opinion. Because we're players. We see him as a teammate, we see him as an opponent. At the end of the day, he is the same person on the court and off the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"There's a lot of great memories with KP. I always used to expect to come in and have a challenge day in and day out going against him in practice. He's one of the guys that used to always, like, motivate me when it came to the things that I did on the floor. I really appreciated him with certain areas that he helped me progress in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"He helped me a lot defensively, too, guarding a guy of his height, a guy that shoots over you. You crawl up into his airspace, he still shoots over you. Finding a way to make that not happen was something I always focused on every day going into practice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's a little different because it's the middle of the day. Obviously, I remember growing up, I wasn't able to watch it being at school. I mean, it's something that everyone watches. I know they have watch parties all over the country. It's a big event and everyone watches it down there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, you could have asked me two years ago if I was going to be here, I would have been shocked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"I think it's kind of the hard work and dedication that I've put into my game. Staying focused throughout it all, through the ups and downs, injuries. Making sure I always got back to just loving basketball, just wanting to be on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Obviously, when I got this opportunity in Dallas, jump on it. I knew we had a good team, but to even look at a year ago and say I'd be here, it's crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"I mean, yeah, you always dream about it. I think just being a kid from Australia, even getting to the NBA was a big thing. More and more guys are doing it now, so it's becoming a thing that a lot of kids growing up look at it like, I can do that, it's not so farfetched."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"It's definitely something you look at, yeah, I did not see this. It's just hard work and you continue to grind every year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, we've been here during the season, kind of the hostility they showed toward Kyrie. They're just passionate. I'm all for it. I love it. They just want their team to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,It's going to be the same when they go to Dallas. It's just going to be a fun series.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's peaks and valleys. The biggest thing I've done is try not to get too high on the highs and low on the lows. There were some very lows. I think I used everything as an opportunity to get better or as a challenge. Definitely going to Europe helped propel my game, build confidence, be a leader on a team of young guys. I think that helped me a lot, to get me to where I am today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know. I don't know why it didn't work out. We were still both young. We tried to make it work, but it just didn't work. So moved on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, his leadership is amazing. The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it. He's keeping us all together and motivated."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Some things he's done, I mean, especially in practice, it's insane. The things he even tries in the game, it's insane. I never seen nobody make those shots. I don't see nobody try those shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,Obviously we know the handles. Just some shots are crazy. It's amazing just to experience this live.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think we'll see how my knee is. But if it's a good, I'm going to go play, yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"More games. You forgot, what was it, World Cup before the season smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Amazing. First time here. Hopefully it's not the last game. But never take it for granted. You never know if you are going to come back, so just enjoy the experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,I think it's very loud crowd. Everybody knows that. They been known for that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,It's hard to play in this place. The crowd is amazing for their team. All I got to say is we got to stay together. It's us against them. We got to stay together.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,But it's going to be really hard to play in this crowd.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it speaks a lot. You seen more examples, too. But I think they fit perfectly with us. The trade made us a so much better team, especially on the defensive end. So, they're in the perfect roles that we need."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it was I remember it, it was quarterfinals of EuroLeague against Panathinaikos in Panathinaikos. The crowd went crazy. They started winning 20-0. Imagine that smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Well, I think it was, like, five questions smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it was great. Definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here. It's been great to see his journey, see where he's at, all the stuff he's going through, stuff like that, to be where he's at it's amazing, it's dope to see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, you learn and grow from your experiences, from being a 25-year-old to being a 27-year-old is a big difference. Yeah, I'm 27 smiling. You learn from those experiences."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"We got a different team. We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka now we have Joe Mazzulla. We had Marcus Smart, Rob Williams we have Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis. Different team, different coach two years later makes a pretty big difference."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think Brad has been great in his role as GM. He was a great coach. I think he just continued that by just being a great GM, being able to put the right pieces together and things like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just happy for him. His schedule has been able to settle down, probably putting a little bit less stress on him than we did when he was coaching us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, no, Brad has been great since he's been a part of the Boston organization. He's helped bring this organization back in terms of winning. He's now been able to move into that GM position and put the right pieces together to get us back to the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of. So I would say a few times at least I've watched the Finals, the whole thing, all the way through."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,Two different people. Two different guys. Joe's got his own style. Ime has his own style. Both were great coaches.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Joe has been able to emphasize what we wanted to be offensively. We're with Joe a little bit longer. Joe had an interim year. Now this is his second year in a sense. Ime only had one year. So it's hard to really compare, contrast, to be honest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, D-White has been great all season long. He's been aggressive. We've empowered him. He's primed for these moments. We want him to come out and recognize when it's his time to strike."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,We feel comfortable with him doing so because he's been doing it all season long.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,I think it's fair. I think it's a fair question. I think it's fair to say that it does affect you being embraced versus being scrutinized.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"One of my favorite quotes is, like, The child who isn't embraced by the village, something like that, you will, what is it? Y'all know this quote, right? You will feel like the warmth."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"The child that doesn't feel the warmth of the village will burn it down, something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, whatever. Neither here nor there smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, you know, referencing that, you get to a point where it's, like, you get scrutinized enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal. Then it just rolls off you. For me, at least, I can say. I don't know if Jayson feels the same way. It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,It just becomes another headline.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's a great question, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,I think this is a special group. I really do. The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"It means a lot. It's a real testament to my hard work, all the time I put in in the gym. I tell myself this is where I want to be, this is where I want to play at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"Being here is great. It's a blessing, especially getting here right now. Something I've been dreaming of my whole life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"I wouldn't say natural. I look at all the videos, but just a lot of trying to learn stuff. It's kind of turned into a hobby."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"I feel like now in the NBA you kind of have to expect stuff like that with the way that teams play, especially the way we play. We have guys, sometimes J.T. is at the five. Myself, as well. We can throw anything out there. Just be prepared, be ready for anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,I've been doing that for a while. I think college. I played it in college sometimes. In high school. Because I was always the tallest guy. I can guard one through five. Feel like switching up is easy for me always.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"No, that's always been in me. I love basketball. I love playing basketball. Before anything, I was a fan of basketball.

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"I love staying engaged. It helps me stay focused, stay locked in. It's just something that, for me, helps me. I also know it helps the guys out there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I have no idea where I was going to go. Every time it kept counting down, just didn't know where to go. Still, I was praying. I was really talking to God the whole entire time, for real. It is what it is. I was in Houston, training just in Houston. So it's time to go back."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, it's the same thing. I'm young, too, so just another piece to add to the table, add to the recipe they've got going on. Just happy to be a part of that program, that organization. Just a lot of rebuilding that has to be going on, but it doesn't really faze me. At the end of the day, I'm just ready to be a Rocket."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"Different feeling, but then again, it's the same feeling. I've been overlooked a lot of times in my life, so it didn't really faze me.

The best day of my life. Just really the start."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"It motivates me to like 150 percent to -- I don't even know. It's just something where I've got to rethink, go in the next day, new mind, free mind. Coming into that organization with a chip on my shoulder, have a lot of motivation on my mind."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"At the end of the day, it doesn't really faze me. I know I'm different than everybody else, but it's just another chapter in my life, another step in the journey. Time to get to work."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, I've been go-getting -- like it doesn't even matter, just in general. Just trying to get better every day, learning about myself on and off the floor. It's definitely something that's been on my mind, but just can't let it faze me. That's really it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, everybody is versatile. Literally just drafted Amen. He's a great player, great athlete. Somebody who I can definitely play alongside. I'm just definitely looking forward to it. So that versatility type of area, I can definitely just add to the table."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"No, I promise you there's not. I have no idea. I don't know what happened. But I feel fine. It's my body. If they think it's something different, they have their own opinions. But at the end of the day, it's my body."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, like I said, everybody can do everything on the floor. Defend, run the floor, rebound, block shots, they can shoot. That's just an advantage. Everybody is an athlete. So there's a lot of run and jump. Run up the floor, that's my play style. I think it will be a great fit with those guys, definitely."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"Well, I just left Houston. I've been there since about a month and a half, just training there with Leo and also training with Aaron Miller. It's time to go back, get right back to work. That's really it."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"They never talked to me really clearly about the NBA because they were such -- how I do say? It was so important, the seasons we were playing, that they didn't really talk to me about the NBA that much, but more about how to prepare for the NBA."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"As we have known I was going to the Spurs for so long, they never really told me about the Spurs, either."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah. Some players have tried to win the championship, win a ring for years and haven't made it. I don't want to be one of those. This is going to be -- my goal is going to be to get closer and closer every time to the ring and to learn how to make it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Probably Finals game, 2013, 2014, around that time. Yeah, this is my farthest memory."

I could not ask for a better welcome than this. I really love the fan base, man."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"You're right, the game shifted a little bit in the last couple years. I think it makes sense because you need a combination of skill but also of luck and genetics to be the best. The best lately have been bigs, and European bigs."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, the road is going to be very long for me to reach the top, but I'm ready to learn from anybody."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I don't know if, as you said, the kids, the seven-footer kids and stuff can learn a lot from me. But they can learn more from themselves. The most important is to know yourself."

I just wanted to send a message to everybody out there that thinks that they can't make it as far as they want to because of where they come from. I'm just living proof that it doesn't matter where you come from, just stay true to yourself and whatever you set your mind to, you can accomplish."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CASON WALLACE,"Definitely. It's a nice drive for my family, if they want to come. But it's just a great spot. It's right there, but it's not too close to home to where they're there every day. I've got a little distance but not too much."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"I would say a hard worker and a versatile defender and just a versatile all-around defender as well. There's a lot of things I can do on the basketball court.

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"Yeah, I've got no clue how they want to -- I mean, I have an idea, but I feel like that's just up to the coach, how he wants to use me, what spots he wants to put me in. He's a very smart coach. He'll be able to figure that out."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"I don't think he would believe it, honestly. I honestly didn't expect myself to get to this point.

But it means a lot to my family seeing all the hard work pay off. Us go back to back, be the first twins in the same draft to go top five, it means a lot."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,I definitely heard about them. My mom told me she used to listen to the Thompson Twins. I heard they're not even really twins. So we're the real ones.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,"Yeah, we're getting a lot of endorsement deals like a duo. It's been fun to shoot those with him, and just the whole process has been great."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,"I think I've become more of a vocal leader, but first I lead by example and I think I can bring that to Houston. I think Houston got a lot of players that have great potential, and I think they have a scary future."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER,"To answer your question, I would say they're going to get a guy that is going to work his tail off every day to get better and help the team get better. I'm going to be the hardest worker on the floor, a guy that you can count on to defend multiple positions and a guy on offense that you can count on to drive, knock down open shots, finish above the rim.

All that matters is to believe in yourself and go out there and be yourself. At the Combine, my workouts, I was just trying to be myself, in terms of being the hardest worker, loudest guy on the floor, making all the hustle plays, playing defense and controlling what I can control, and letting everything else be."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER,"That's how I was able to have a really good performance in the Combine and really good performances in my workouts, because I focused on the things I could control and I outworked everybody out there.

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI,"People question my defense. I get to play against Draymond Green, All-Defensive player, Gary Payton, All Defensive player.

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"The G League experience has prepared me so much because I really got that feel for the game. With the game that we play in the G League, it's the same thing as the NBA -- the pace, the competitiveness and everything that goes to it. Guys that are coming up and down from the league, guys trying to make their way into the league. I already have that feel. Going into it, I feel like my game right now is ready, and I'm better than ever."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"I feel like that will work to my advantage because with that in my bag and then all the other things I have to offer, it makes me tougher to guard. When you game-plan against me, there are so much things I could do out there. Having people on their toes and aware of me out there. It's good I can do those things, but I'm just continuing to get better and add more."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"His coaching style made me like him so much because he likes dogs and I feel like I'm a dog out there on the court. I bring it every night. He holds me accountable, and he's just always on me. I need a coach that is always on me and pushing me to get better because that's what I need. I need to be the best version of myself I can be."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"Coach Hart is a great person off the court, as well. He's very caring. He's a great dude. I'm glad that I was able to be coached by him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"I've had an interview with the Spurs, so I got a sense of who is in the office, the staff that the Spurs have as an organization. I'm familiar with Jeremy Sochan on the team. I talked to him. Also what they've done in the past with Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, that era. They were really successful, and they have a history of winning."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"Right now they're trying to get it back to what it was before. It can definitely be done because the organization is really good, and they have good people to get it back to what it needs to be."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,I'm bringing my mom. It's that simple.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"I definitely feel like I can make it happen. I feel like I can definitely see myself having a great time in Dallas and being a great fit. I was just on the phone with him less than two minutes ago. He was just saying, ""Congratulations and we're just excited to have you and we're excited to start,"" which is exactly the same exact feeling I'm feeling."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's definitely something that's going to be able to grow. It's something I've always had. Just because I wasn't able to excel at it or show it as much as I wanted to, that doesn't mean I never had it. I'm just excited to hit the ground running and show everybody what I can do."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"I've seen a lot of drafts over the years. Each year you kind of see, it seems that much closer. Whenever you finally hear your name on the screen, you hear it in the crowd, you hear it in the loud speakers, it's like a dream just getting started. My dream is not to get to the NBA but to stay in the NBA. It's kind of starting the ball rolling, and let's see where it goes."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, it's always been some form of competitive nature, not even on the East Coast, just in Philadelphia, having that grit, having that hustle and having that determination to do whatever it takes. No matter how hard the world will beat you down, you've got to get back up and fight twice as hard."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"Whenever I think about Westtown, I think about when I was a freshman watching, I was probably 6'10"", weighed 190. Even thinking about Team Final, I was probably 6'7"", 170."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just thinking about how far I've came and the people that came with me, I'm so grateful and I'm so thankful."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"Living at a high school -- I went to a boarding school, so I was always kind of living on my own and I was always able to do that. But being able to take basketball from a game that you enjoy and turning it into a business and your career, it takes not a step, it takes a leap. It just kind of takes the maturity you've got to have to be able to focus in on each practice, each film session, each game, and being able to try to get 1 percent better every day."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"Before that, I'm just kind of taken aback. I didn't really listen to -- I was looking at Kobe Bufkin. Just got picked, man. There's a lot of emotions going on. I might cry for him, not even me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"To answer your question, it's like a brotherhood within Michigan. I'm just excited to be around people I'm comfortable with and I'm familiar with. I can't wait to get on the team and help."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"Man, it's my brother. It's my brother, man. We've been through tough times this year. We weren't successful as we wanted to be, but just being in the trenches with him and seeing how well he carried himself and him showing me the ropes as a freshman, it means a lot to me just to see him over there smiling like that. That's for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"It's exciting. It feels like my work has paid off. Yeah, I honestly feel like I can't wait to go out to Summer League and just prove that I'm supposed to be in this spot."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"Honestly, I feel like I'll fit in like a glove with my ability to space the floor and make open shots. I've always been able to play with good other players throughout high school and college, so I think I'll fit in really well with them."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"I forgot about that, wow. Yeah, he just told me that. It means the world. These past few months, he's been pushing me to places I've never been conditioning-wise, and just to see my work pay off like that, it's a beautiful moment. All praise to God, honestly."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me. But to my teammates and the fans there, they're getting a big-time player and even better person. Just somebody who is going to bring it every day, push the people around me. Just someone that is going to work hard."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"It's honestly really crazy and kind of hard to say how I feel because growing up I was a big Kobe fan. I was always watching his videos, watching the Lakers. For me to get drafted by the Lakers is kind of surreal and kind of crazy."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Like I said, I'm thankful to the organization and I'm super excited."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Even going back a little bit, sitting in that chair, I'm not really a person who gets too high or too low. Today, my emotions were like a roller coaster So it was everywhere. To finally get that call and hear my name called, it was kind of like a relief."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"But yeah, like I said, I was super happy, super excited. It was just a great moment."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"I just got drafted to obviously a historic and great organization. The organization is only getting better and better. Obviously, they're competing for championships."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"For me to get drafted there, I'm going to bring it every day, like I said, try to impact as much as I can and learn from the guys that are there, especially for one of the all-time greats, LeBron James, and AD and the rest of the guys. It's going to be great."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"I think really just my approach. I'm a player who I'm going to bring it every day, work hard and I think I check a lot of boxes. Obviously, I'm a big guard, size, can score from all three levels, unselfish, get my teammates involved and then I can also really guard, guard multiple positions. Overall, I think I'm a really good player and an even better person."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"I feel like I'll bring a lot more length to the Jazz, and my shooting ability and my defensive versatility is something I can bring to the Jazz."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"Yes, I am definitely prepared. I'm not really around snow too much, so it's going to be different. I'm going to have a lot of snow fights."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"Hearing my name was, like, insane. Like, it still doesn't even feel real."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"I think the first person I could remember off the top of my head was watching Bam Adebayo go to the Miami Heat. I was watching his highlights from high school probably a couple hours before. I didn't even know the draft was going to come on, and then I turned on the TV, wait a few minutes and he gets drafted. I was like, what? I was just watching his highlights. That was probably the person I could think off the top of my head."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"I know the Utah Jazz, they like to play big. They like big lineups. They like moving Lauri to the 3. I feel like I could fit in that team really well because they have a lot of length, so I'm going to be right with them. My shooting ability could really help them out, as well."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"You never really know on draft night, but on my visit I had a great time with all the people I met with and the dinner. I mean, I love Orlando. I love the city. Love Utah, too. They want me, so I want them."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"I'm just happy. It's finally here. I'm blessed. My family was there with me. To go to Portland is kind of going full circle. My guy Pooh Jeter there, texted Dame not too long ago. So it's up. It's up when I get there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Yeah, I didn't really pay too much attention to that. I paid attention to what mattered and that was the work that went into being here to this day."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"If they do decide to trade or do whatever with the pick, man, I'm just going to continue to work, control what I can."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Man, for sure. I'm the most prepared player in the draft. That's what I say. The fact that I went there for two years just taught me so much. On the court, as well, but a lot of things off the court. I learned how to be a pro off the court. Just so much time off and just trying to find what to do. I found the hobbies that I like to do."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Ignite definitely showed me a lot of things that I wouldn't get anywhere else. I'm blessed that I did the two years that I did, and I grew so much from it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"No, not at all. I'm glad to see Brandon go there. I'm pretty sure it's a great fit for him. That's how I move. I move with love. I'm not mad that I didn't go 2 or I didn't go 1. I'm blessed to go 3, and to be here with my family with me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"We play against pros every night and guys that killed college, guys that killed overseas, guys that are going up and down in the league, coming down just to play against us, to show that they can dominate draft picks or whatever the case may be. That's why I always say prepared."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"We learned a lot of things at the beginning of the season that has nothing to do with skill set, things that go on behind closed doors of basketball, the business of it. Just learned how to be a pro, like I said, on the court and off the court."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,So it was special. It was a special two years.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Yeah, I'm hoping to get to play with Dame, for sure. Special talent, special guard. One of my favorites to watch, especially film-wise. Just to pick out how he moves off the court, as well. Yeah, it would be cool to play with him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"I'm just one of the few in the league right now, so I'm blessed to be a part of that group. I'm blessed to be a part of people from Marietta striving. It's amazing to represent. It's amazing to represent my family and especially the city, my gym, all that. It's great."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"I'm proud of the growth I've had and how much I've grown as a person off the court. I wasn't really talkative and I didn't really speak much, but the second year I grew into a loud person and a leader that needed to come out."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Playing the guard position, going into next year, I know I will have to be vocal, especially at the point guard. Just growing that much at that rate, it was great to me. I always look back to that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"You're going to get the best shooter in the draft, championship player, a guy that can space the floor out for Zion and BI."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,She's in Baton Rouge. She was really happy for me. She was giving me congratulations. So it's pretty cool we're going to be in the same state.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"Yeah, I did work out with them. It was one of my better workouts. I had no clue really where I was going to go. A couple of the teams passed up on me that I worked out for, but they took the chance on me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"A whole bunch of emotions. I told somebody I wasn't going to cry, but I wimped out. It was a really cool experience."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"He's meant everything to me. Just said he loved me. I love that guy to death. Without him, none of this is possible. He helped me so much through my career, the two years I was with him. I'm really grateful for him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,They're going to have to see my face every single day. That's going to be lovely.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"I was there for one of my workouts. I was only there for two days, but it's an amazing city. I heard the food is really, really good."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"I didn't get the chance to. I was kind of sick when I was up there, too. I didn't leave my hotel room. I'm probably going to gain a couple of pounds because of the food. So that will be a good thing."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Yeah, the Jazz is going to get a guy that is going to come in, work hard, coachable, willing to learn each and every day. Of course my scoring ability I feel like is one of the best. My creativity with the basketball."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,I know they're going to get an all-around player. Continue to compete each and every day. Just going to play winning basketball.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Right, man. I'm just blessed that they have that belief in me. But to answer your question, he's a legend when it comes to this basketball stuff, so he knows what he's talking about."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"It's going to be fun to be able to pick his brain, continue to learn each and every day from him. He's going to really be that mentor or be that source that I'm able to ask questions and get a full understanding of things that I want to know."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"I just went in there with no expectations. Whatever happens, happens. I felt like I put myself in the best position possible to have a team trust my talent and trust my abilities and trust that I would make an impact on the team."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Now getting my name called, shed a few tears with your family. It's a big relief off your shoulders because this is what you put work in for."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"But now understand, enjoy this night. But now it's time to get to work whenever I get down there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Yeah, man, it's an all-time blessing being in the NBA, for one. Two, like you said, they're in a situation. I'm just going there, and whatever the coach needs me to do, whatever my role is, when I have the opportunity to sit down with him and understand what is needed of me, then that's when I'll be able to take that next jump throughout the season, continuing to learn, like I said before."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,I'm just excited. I'm just excited to get down there.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Just a player that is really going out there, giving all he's got. The competitiveness, it's the answer a lot of people say, but it's really true for me personally that I want to go out and win. I want nothing more than that. But personally just a versatile type player that takes pride in his shooting. That's just going out there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Off the court, I like to have fun. So it's going to be a great time in Toronto."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"It's Dorothy from Wizard of Oz. I'm from Kansas, she's from Kansas. I've got her little slippers in my coat. Just the colors, I guess."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"No, I didn't. That was one of my last workouts. I had a great time there. I was hoping, and it kind of worked out good with the colors. I'm beyond blessed. I'm happy."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Get ready because it's going to be a fun time, a fun, fun time. Paired with Scottie Barnes, you already know that's going to be -- I'm looking forward to it. Got to get out there, see Drake. I haven't seen him a bunch, but I'm looking forward to that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,Of course. That's the goal. I need him to wear my jersey. That's how I know -- that's my priority.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Not too much. The main focus through this pre-draft process was everything on the court. That's what it's always going to be for me, just keeping the main thing the main thing. But obviously there's stuff to talk about off the court. So later on the road, obviously. But as of now, I'm excited to get out there tomorrow. I can't really put into words how I'm really feeling about it all."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Me and Coach, he was there for one of my last workouts a couple weeks ago. Got to meet him for the first time. Just a stand-up, sharp dude. I just got off FaceTime with him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"It's hard to explain. I'm still kind of on this adrenaline rush. But a coach that I look forward to playing with so, so, so much. Being in that system, and then another teammate I talked about earlier was Scottie Barnes. Talked to him on FaceTime and got to know him a little through our agency last year when he went through this process."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,Everything just seems meant to be. So I'm excited.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Like I said, it's hard to put this all into words. But just the raw emotion, that everything comes out when I'm looking around the table seeing how my family is reacting, stuff like that. Tonight I'm going to take it for myself and my family to celebrate, celebrate this success."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"But tomorrow just know that I'm going back out there, and this wasn't the end goal by any means. This is kind of the start to my real-life goals, and that's to be in the NBA and compete."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"I think the biggest one I'm just trying to focus on, it's more a broader one, but really just going out there and trying to make an instant impact. Go there and be a sponge and try to get all the information as a rookie and know that I have a ton to learn and a great coach to learn from and a great team to play with and learn from, also."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Oh, man. A competitor. Two-way player that can play defense. A good playmaker. Can score, too."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Yeah, I hope so, but that's just a great process, too, so I love it. Just waiting for the call and everything, yeah, I love it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Yeah, Wemby is more than a teammate. That's like my brother. I just expect nothing from him, but he's like that. He's just a great guy. So yeah, that's just unbelievable. Yeah, he's good."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"For your first, no, I didn't have any idea. But I was like, Pacers? I didn't talk to them or nothing. So I was like, that's a surprise. But love it. Now that I know the trade and everything, I'm just like, oh, now I understand. So that's it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"And for French basketball, I'm so happy for it. We're getting more and more in this league. So yeah, just happy for that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Yeah, we talked a lot about that. We just wish the best for French basketball, French national team. We'll see this summer what's going on. I don't know if I'm going to the French national team or not. We'll see, and just hope the best for that team."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Offensively I think I can bring a lot spacing the floor, decision-making, a bunch of different things offensively."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Defensively is where I hang my hat. Guard multiple positions. We protect the rim. We do it all. From a mental standpoint, I do whatever I'm asked. I'm a good teammate, things like that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"I'd like to think we play a very modern style at Bama, probably the most translatable to the league. Then obviously he always told me, not everybody is going to be a star, some people are going to be role players. You've got to find your role and be the best at your role, and those are the players that play the longest."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,I think finding my role on my new team and perfecting it will be key to my success early.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Truthfully I haven't considered much about most teams because I didn't know where I was going to go until tonight. It's probably something I'll look into more now that I know where I'm going. But again, development is the biggest piece to all this if you ask me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Most of my time was spent in Times Square. I actually came here for a workout I want to say Tuesday. Had a workout, medical, all that good stuff. It was good experience. They had good energy in the workout. Everything went great. To be in the building when I get drafted to them, it was surreal."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"I had a few teams in my head that I knew might want me. I knew after my workout that I was pretty solidified that if I made it there to that pick, that they were going to get me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"We talk more, truthfully, about workouts, things that we've been doing. To be honest, most of our conversations have been just conversations. It hasn't been about this. We knew it was coming. We knew possibilities, what could happen."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Yeah, I'm happy for him. It was good to see my brother succeeding with me. Yeah, proud of him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Truthfully, no. Bits and pieces of players I like. I like how some players shoot the ball. I like how some players defend. I like Jaren Jackson he guards multiple positions. Obviously a little bit bigger than me, so I wouldn't compare myself to him necessarily. But I like to pick bits and pieces from different players' games to try to build myself."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"So the players I know, that I've watched the most are Nic Claxton because he's from my area back home, very nearby, and then I like Mikal Bridges because of the role he played with the Suns and then to come here and step up. Kind of waited his turn."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"As a teammate, I'm encouraging but I don't like to let people slide with less than what they're capable of. I hold people accountable, and I hope others hold me accountable."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Off the court, I'm fun. On the court, I'm like, we've got to win this. We've got to get better every day."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"I'm excited, man. The way I always explained it is whoever picked me, that's who really wanted me, and I always want to be somewhere I'm wanted. To be picked here in New York, and this is my first time ever being in New York, so it's exciting. It's very exciting."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Two to three years from now, that's hard. I never really think about me individually. Obviously, I want to get better and perfect my game in every part possible. I want to be as versatile as I can be, as far as dribbling, shooting, everything. I want to be able to pass the ball well because when you're a good decision-maker, that makes the game a whole lot easier offensively."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"And defensively, I want to be a force. I want to be in conversations for Defensive Player of the Year awards. That's something I always strive to do. But truthfully, I want playoff runs. I want to win."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Bringing a high level of focus, competitive nature, a defensive presence and, when we get to flow, playmaking and offensive threat."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"It means everything to us. That Michigan team was very tight, and me and Jett specifically were really tight, me and Juwan were really tight. It was like family. When he went to Orlando, there was a level of joy that you're unable to control it. You're happy to see your guys be successful, for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"I mean, Trae Young is an on-ball threat. So I'm comfortable playing on ball if he needs a break, off ball if he doesn't need a break. I feel like I've proven myself to be able to be a threat on or off the ball."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"I'm just looking forward to getting to Atlanta and being able to compete. It's something I've dreamed of, and I'm finally here. Take the most out of it, for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Very excited. This is what we work for. I'm just happy to be successful in this way. There's many different ways this could have ended up, but it took me here, so I'm glad to be here."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Yeah, it's the first time for everybody that is right there, so it's definitely nerves, where am I going to go. All these things are going through your head, but at the end of the day, eventually your name is going to be called. That's kind of like a pillow you can -- it's something that is going to hold you up because you know you're going to go."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Just being here is a dream, and I'm just happy. ATL is the place."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"My first phone call, I haven't had it yet. My first phone call will probably be to my grandma, my grandma Lou. There's a lot of media going on. Definitely calling my granny after this."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Yes, she is in Grand Rapids."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,"I'm super excited. There's a lot of talent on the floor, a lot of young dudes. It'll be a fun team, for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,"Yeah, it's a good feeling. It's always good playing with dudes who compete on both ends and want to win. I see a lot of that playing with this group, so it's going to be fun."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,I think my playmaking is definitely my best ability. I think playing with two good players like that will make it a little easier on me and them because I can help them get buckets and they can take some of it off me at the same time.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,It's always fun playing with good players whenever you're a playmaking guard.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,"Just shooting a lot of shots every day, continuing to gain confidence in my jumper, continuing to get stronger in the weight room and attack that every day. That's been the main focus in pre-draft."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,For sure. I take a lot of pride in defense. I think that's a lot of the reason I'm here is my defense. I think that's something I can bring from day one. I think that's just something I can bring to the team from day one is probably defense.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"It's just really -- it's a lot of excitement. I think before it was a little more nervousness, now it's just pure excitement to get ready and get to Dallas."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, I think once I moved freshman year into college here in the U.S. and California it was a goal of mine, but then once I think I took that next step to Iowa State, I think the coaches kind of helped me see that view of being able to make it to the league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, it's exciting. You watch them play and now you get to get meet them and be alongside them and watch them practice, and I think it's just a big learning curve that we'll get to have and develop as a player, but yeah, it's pure excitement for sure."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, I think just the people that I've been around just at Iowa State have been so supportive. Even when I got injured, there was tears, and for every athlete it's hard getting injured but they were like, let's take the next step. What do we have to do next? So, they were always encouraging, supportive, getting me to start working out. We were in the gym pretty much all day, but yeah, it's just been all the people at Iowa State have been so great."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, the rehab is going really well. Iowa State, they have great resources that we have been using throughout these few couple months, and our trainers Meaghan Clark and Mercedes, they've been coming alongside me and helping me through every single part of the process, which is a long process, but it's been really great of them."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, it was a very interesting feeling. It's just like pure excitement of going to Washington but now getting to go to Dallas. I mean, yeah, it's going to be a great, great next step to the journey."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, they've been pretty crazy. We've still got school. So, it's just been working out, as well, getting all the workouts we need because we want to get better to 100 percent, so working out, school, and now getting ready for the draft. It's been a crazy last couple weeks, but I've been enjoying every moment of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, just with my length and just being able to help defensively and offensively, spreading out the defense and the offense, playing inside and outside, just versatility, and yeah, all of that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Oh, no, they for sure inspire me a lot. I started playing for the Brazil team five years ago. So I've been able to get to know Clarissa, Erika de Souza, Damiris Dantas. They've kind of helped me through my pathway too. I love them so much, and yeah, they've for sure been a part of my journey."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, for sure surprised. Someone just tapped me, like you got traded. I was like, what? That happened so fast. Yeah, I think I'm just ready to get to Dallas now and start getting to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I mean, it's a dream come true. I can't even put into words right now. You've got a million things going through your mind. But I've been surrounded by good people, good teammates, and I wouldn't be here without any of them."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yep, they went to Marist together. Fortunately, I was in Dallas last week for the Final Four, so got to check it out a little bit. I loved it when I was there. I know they're a young team, really up and coming. So, I'm so happy to be a part of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Oh, gosh, probably USA this summer, 3-on-3. But before then, probably sophomore year."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, I'm super excited. I know the Wings have a lot of great players. Just to be surrounded by great players, I'm just excited."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, for sure. I love Villanova. That'll be home forever. But unfortunately nothing lasts forever, and I feel like God had opened a door, and it was time for me to walk through."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I think I have a really high motor, so just constantly moving without the ball, moving on both sides of the ball, defense and offense. Just going after offensive rebounds and just trying to do all the hustle plays."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Oh, my gosh, I've learned so much. Just believe in yourself, surround yourself with good people and you can achieve anything."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Definitely the people. My coaches, my teammates, the administration, all the people at Villanova. It's such a family, such a community. Just knowing I'm going to have that with me for the rest of my life makes it a little bit easier."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, I think the NIL really allowed college athletes to start to build their brand and I'm fortunate that I caught the beginning of that in the last two years. So just continuing to use the resources around me, using my platform to spread my message and promote my brand."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I was holding onto his hand for dear life, just waiting to hear your name called. But to spend it with them, my family is the most important thing in the world to me, and I would not be here without them. The rest of my extended family is at a restaurant down the street, so I can't wait to go celebrate with them after."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I think the unknown. I haven't been there yet, so I don't really know what to expect. So yeah, I guess the unknown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, I mean, I'll play whatever position they need me to play. We're fortunate at Villanova we play a five-out, so I played 1 through 5, so I'll do whatever they need."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Probably like halfway through my college career is when I realized like maybe you could play in the WNBA. It probably wasn't until this year where I was like, oh, you might get picked pretty high. I don't know, I just never looked that far ahead until recently."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,I'm super excited. God is good. I got the opportunity to play professional. I appreciate the Connecticut Sun offering me and giving me the opportunity. I'm going to take full advantage of it. I'm super thankful and grateful.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,Remarkable.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Absolutely. I also have history, so I understand why teams may have been skeptical to pick me at first, but like I said earlier, I'm super grateful for the opportunity. I'm going to take full advantage. You've seen me do it with Coach Mulkey and I came out a national champion and I plan to do that in the WNBA. My will to win is incredible, and my competitive nature is unmatched. Can't be matched. I'm just grateful, man."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Yeah, he was a super villain of Superman. He was the archenemy, so yeah."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I'm not saying that. The picture has been painted that way, so I kind of just like to have fun with it and embrace it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"There's only one champ, right? There's only one champ in the room. I've been overwhelmed, but it's with positive energy, love and support. Everybody wants me to know how proud they are of me. I'm just so happy. Now I can just breathe. I can take everything all in and start preparing for what's to come."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Just showing my ability to score at this height and to be a three-level threat, not just by shooting the mid-range but knocking down threes, getting to the paint, facilitating, leading my team, and I also think by winning it helped my draft stock a lot, too. I'd just say scoring. I'm considered to be undersized, so there's more expected out of me being a smaller guard. I played up to some expectations."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I'm just going to start with Coach Mulkey. I'm just going to drag along her principles, her discipline, her structure that she supplied for the team, like being on time, being early, being the last one in the gym, tuck my jersey. The little things, I'm going to carry those small things over into the league. Because that's what's been keeping me successful this far. So if it's not broke, I don't want to -- there's nothing to fix. I'll just carry the little things over to my new organization, the Connecticut Sun."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Well, hopefully some of those followers just follow me along, and that's not to be cocky or anything, but I am a national champion, so hopefully that can bring some more attention and viewership to the league. My ultimate goal is to grow this game, and whether I'm a part of it or not, I want to make an impact on the league for the younger generations, for the women coming up under us. It's bigger than me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Okay, as far as the SEC and playing in that conference, the SEC is one of the toughest conferences I've ever played in. I've been in the Big 12, the Big Ten, and it's the physicality, the pace of the game, and just the competitiveness. The league is just special. The SEC is different."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"As a competitor and in order to keep myself motivated, you have to find little things like that. I like to find little things that keep me fueled and keep a chip on my shoulder because I feel like that's when I perform at my best."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Like I said, as far as being underrated, I really just don't care about the opinions. I know the time that I put in towards my craft."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Some people will never give me credit just for my height. She's 5-6, she's little, she's tiny. They'll never give me credit for that. They can't see past the height thing. So it's like, I don't really get into the ratings. I'm going to congratulate all of those young ladies who went before me and after me. We just made a huge accomplishment. We're living our dreams right now. But when it comes down to spots, we're all competing for one."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Oh, yeah, big day, congratulations. Go Tigers. That was one of my fellow seniors, and I'm super happy and I'm super proud for Day. She's mild, she's quiet, she's laid back, and a lot of people didn't really get to say Day perform because she was in the shadow of Angel, but I think y'all seen later on down the stretch that she was a key piece to our puzzle, and I'm so happy that she got this opportunity, of course. Thank you, Day."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,Leadership. Like learning how important leadership is in order to win at the highest levels.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I've been playing the point guard position my whole life, but I wasn't under Coach Mulkey my entire college career, and she pushes and she pulls certain things out of us that we don't even know we have in us sometimes, and I appreciate Coach for that because I value the small things. Yeah."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,I didn't speak to them before the draft but they did FaceTime me and congratulate me and I thanked them for picking me and giving me an opportunity to live my dream. I plan on calling them after I'm done with all the media and stuff just to get to know them. This is fitting to be my new home.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Go hard every day, be coachable, listen to my vets. Just go in there and compete and leave it all out there and let the pieces fall where they fall. I believe in God. I don't think He'll ever set me up to fail. He didn't bring me this far to just leave me hanging. I know He didn't do that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,I'm going to leave it all out there in training camp and let the pieces fall where they fall.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I mean, you've always got to give credit to the legends and the people who came before you because they paved the way for me so I wouldn't have been able to see this day if they weren't my leaders and my role models. So I give a lot of credit to them. It means a lot to me. Like now I'm in that position, so now I have people looking up to me and I just am going to take what I learned from them and apply it in my own way and be a leader."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Coach Mulkey got a lot. Her pro list is about to extend. She has them coming in. Easy, yeah. She got them come in. She's going to get them."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Because I'm hungry. I think I said this in Dallas. Like I'm just super hungry, and everything I lost, like I'm going to get it. I'm going to take it. With all respect, I lost so much from my freshman year. I know it's still out there for me to gain. That's just how I approach everything."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"But always respectful, though. Always respectful, yeah, and with love."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"Yeah, Maryland was a progression. Starting freshman year, thinking I was going to be a star -- yeah, no. It definitely took a progression."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"But I think all the growing pains made me who I am today, and I'm super grateful for it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,Just a lot of hard work and determination and having a coach that is constantly attacking you to get better is something that helps you and motivates you to be who you can be.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I think just being an all-around player. I can do multiple things. I feel like I'm a three-level scorer and I also can play on both sides of the court. Yeah, I think that can help."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"Sometimes in life you don't want to stay in one place for too long. I felt like that's what I was doing if I stayed at Maryland. It would just be like because I'm scared to take the next step. I'm not scared. Transitions are always scary, don't get me wrong, but I think I'm excited and ready for a new journey in life, as well."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I think I'm just never satisfied. Even now, I know I have so much more to develop. The player you see right now or the last game I played, I'm not going to be in another two years. I'm just constantly trying to develop and be a sponge to the game and constantly find new things."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I just remember watching Maya Moore. That's some big shoes to fill, and I'm not filling her shoes by any means. I'm going to be Diamond Miller as soon as I step on the new city."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"But yeah, Cheryl, she seems tough already, so I'm really excited. We had great talks, and yeah, she's really passionate, and luckily for me, I kind of had a similar coach in college. So I think the transition of coaching styles might be the same. Super excited."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,I just want to say he's from UMD and his story of where he is right now is the reason why people keep going.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"You're one of my reasons why I keep going, just because of your situation, and I feel like we just continue to work. You can't be sad in one place for too long, and somehow you just get back up even when you're not happy with the situation."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"It's so funny that you said that because I was just thinking in my head, like what is going on right now? I'm still kind of in disbelief. But I think once everything starts settling in and I realize, okay, this is where I'm at right now, I'll be okay, but right now I still feel like a college student. I'm still in college classes. Until I think that ends, I'm going to be like, all right, I'm a pro."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,My expectations is just to be Diamond Miller every time I step on the court and to continue to be passionate and love the game the way I always did when I was a little kid. That is what I want to do.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I just think it just shows that when you work hard, success is going to come. Obviously the journey isn't smooth sailing as you would like it to be, but when you make it, even with those hard times and the times you feel like things are hard and you make it past those moments, it makes this moment right here a little bit more special because you know how much you went through to be in this moment."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"Oh, absolutely, and I think throughout my life I've always had those changes. I did USA Basketball. I went from high school to college. Transfers and stuff like that. There's always change going to come. What has to stay solid is your confidence in who you are as a person and what you bring to the table."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Just blessed more than anything, just blessed to be here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Yeah, that's something that I've always liked to pride myself on, my shooting ability and scoring ability. But I'm just excited to get to Indiana and do that, just be me basically. But yeah, I think being a little less athletic, my shooting ability has been something that's helped offset my lack of athleticism at times, but I'm also just excited to get to Indiana and be a sponge and find ways that I can get better."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"It's an incredible list of people you just named. There's also people on the list they didn't even name, Kelsey Mitchell and other people that are incredibly talented, have been veterans of the league. I'm excited to get there and pick their brains in ways that I can help add to the team and be a good addition and be a vocal leader wherever they need me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Very excited to play with her and just to get to pick her brain a little bit about the league and just her journey through the W. I got to talk to her a little bit earlier today, and she gave me some advice and told me just to enjoy the moment and just keep being me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,I've not seen that but I am very excited to see that. My hometown and home has meant a lot to me. Just being close to home with Ohio State has meant so much to have my family in my backyard. So I'm excited to be that close to home and have my family ties.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Yeah, Grace is incredibly talented and we've had a lot of battles when she was at Indiana and I was at Ohio State. Even when I was at Maryland we had some battles. She's an incredible competitor, and I'm excited to be on the other end of that this time."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I want to say I'm grateful to be here. This is unbelievable for me to be doing this right now, so just very blessed."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"It feels surreal. Really didn't think I would be here one day. I've come a long way, gone through a lot of challenges, but also opportunities, and all of my steps that I've been through have led me to here. Just feels very blessed."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"A lot of people have helped me to get here. It's just a very exciting moment. My stepdad, my parents helped me every day to get here, to get to college. So I'm very grateful for them and just all the people, all the coaches, all the teammates that have trusted me along the way to get here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I think it started when I went from Fairfield to UConn, when I decided to go in the transfer portal. I heard it from other people, and I think I started believing more in myself that by competing at a high level like UConn, that could help me for my professional career. It started, yeah, I would say a year ago."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,I think that I'm just very excited to learn and to play at another level. I hope I can fit in the team that I'm going to and just learning from other experienced players and try to have an impact at some point.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"Well, first, merci. But yes, I think this year my exposure being at a bigger school helped me, I think. Having that impact that I've had all year long, it's something that is kind of crazy to realize. I'm just very happy to be able to maybe have an opportunity with the French national team, and just to be here right now is amazing."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I want to win. I've always loved to win. Whether I was in France, in Ireland, in Fairfield or UConn. My goal always is to win and always have the best experiences with my teammates. I'm a very competitive person, so I just want to win."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"It feels great. I hope to inspire a lot of other players from mid-major schools, that nothing is impossible. As cliche as it sounds, it's very true if you put the work in and if you believe. People are always going to give you opportunities, like UConn did for one year. Even if you're at a mid-major school, you can always reach higher."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I think I do. I think this year at UConn it was a way for me to play again a faster pace, a lot of transition, a lot of motion type of offense. I think that is something that they did a lot in Europe, and I'm just very excited to transition it to the professional level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It means everything to me. I think just being able to experience this, being both of us internationals, fifth years coming from UConn, I think it's super special. I'm super happy for her. Whenever her name was called, I was super excited for her. But it's very special."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I think we had definitely a challenging season that brought us together. We were able to build that connection, that friendship that I think is going to last forever. So I couldn't be happier to have her by my side."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I'm looking forward to just going there. Obviously knowing that Napheesa Collier is there is definitely a huge excitement for me. Just learning a lot from her whenever I came to UConn, watching a lot of film on her, how can I be successful in a UConn jersey, because she was so successful already at UConn. Kind of learning a lot of things from her just watching her play. But now kind of being there and learning from her, having that leader, I'm very excited. But even just the whole organization."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I'm definitely a very competitive person. I know they are. I know they want to win a WNBA championship. I'm just excited to go there, learn from them and start to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,I believe it's not really one specific thing but more just my versatility of being able to impact the game offensively and defensively a lot of different ways.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I was able to come to UConn and have totally two different seasons. First season obviously coming off the bench, just kind of learning the ways I can impact the game, who knows in how many minutes. Some games I got a lot of minutes, some games not so much. So I had to definitely take advantage of that and learning a different role, and now this season more of a leadership role, playing heavy minutes. I was counted on more offensively, defensively."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Even just the past two years I think just prepared me for the next level and just kind of showing that versatility. And I think just going to Minnesota, I've seen a lot of similarities of how they play, how UConn plays. Seeing Napheesa playing there being so successful is definitely very exciting to me. I'm just excited to see how my game can translate into that and what I can bring to the table."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,But it's definitely just exciting to work and excited to get there and meet everybody and go to work.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I think one of the things that definitely all of them said is just enjoy the moment. I think they told me to not stress, whether I get picked up in the first round, second round. It's definitely where you fit."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Just enjoying and embracing this moment, I think that was the biggest lesson. I feel like I truly embraced it. I was very excited just to see my name pop up. It didn't matter if it was first round, second round. I'm just excited to be here. I know they're going to be always around me. I'm always going to be part of the Huskies family. I can always go talk to coaches, call them whenever, even the alums. It's just a big family. So it's nice to have them as my support group that I can always go to and ask questions about the WNBA."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"So before I got ready it was a mix of things. The makeup artist did not believe it was my own playlist. I did my favorite karaoke song ever to ""'Cause I Love You"" by Lenny Williams, best song ever. We had some ""Sweet Thing"" by Mary J. Blige and some Anthony Hamilton. We had it all. It was a good pre-draft ready mix. Yeah, good vibes."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, the camcorder was The Players' Tribune idea to kind of accompany the podcast. So it was really fun to have it all day. When I first pulled it out, I saw Aliyah first. Her room was two doors down. She was like, girl, what are we doing today? It took me like an hour to figure it out last night. I was looking at the blue screen. Took me a minute, but it was really cool. The girls all had fun with it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"And I think for me today I tried not to let the nerves get the best of me. It was really just trying -- I can't control what's going to happen and I'm trying not to control the uncontrollables. It was being able to enjoy the moment, have my family out there, the people who mean the most to me. Just kind of sink into the moments and have a good time."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"A lot excites me. I think especially just it's a young group, and with good veteran pieces, as well, but I'm excited just to get to work. They have the new ownership group that's been in place the past few years, new coaches. So I think they're building a really great team right now. They had a great season last year with that young group."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"So I'm excited to join it. I think I can impact the team in different ways. So just getting to Atlanta, getting to it, it's a homecoming in a way. All of my mom's family is from Georgia. So, I know my phone is blowing up right now. Probably lots of missed calls. So I'm excited to get out there and just get to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, I'm used to being in charge with the questions, so not being ready for what you guys are going to say is a little nerve-racking, but I now see how my guests feel. But it's fun to be on the other side of things is what I started off doing."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"It's amazing. Every day at practice in high school I saw D-Rob up on the wall. So now that I get join her on a team with a Mitty legend, it's hard to describe really. It's something that I looked up to. She was the first Mitty legend in the women's basketball program. So now to get to play alongside her is kind of amazing. I don't really have any other words to describe it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I think I'm just looking to come in -- the way that I've grown a lot from my freshman year until now is I've become I think more outspoken. I like to advocate for things, just kind of be myself, be genuine, authentic. As I move into the league, I look to do the same things on the court, being open and honest with my teammates, being a sponge, ready to learn. Then off the court speaking up for what I believe in. If changes need to be made, I'm not afraid to say what I think, have the tough conversations, be in those rooms and push the league to the next level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,And I think everybody ahead of me has done an amazing job of blazing the trail now that now I get to be a part of. Just continuing to keep the torch flowing and push it on to the next generation behind me.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I'm jealous it's still bright there on the West Coast. But I think at Stanford I went through a lot of different things. I had an injury my freshman year and then it was COVID season and we won. I've won three Pac-12 championships, two Final Fours. It's a lot of winning."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Just kind of having that be the standard, I think I'm going to be able to just bring that energy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"But I've learned a lot. I've learned how to work with different types of people, how to create relationships off the court, team chemistry, how to have tough conversations, get the best out of your teammates. I think I can bring a lot of different things, but I'm really excited to get to Atlanta, meet my new teammates and just get busy, I guess."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Just excitement really. I'm excited to join the league. I think that there's so much talent across the league already, and all the draftees. So just to get my name called sixth pick is amazing. It's just full of excitement. There weren't really any predictions on where I was going to go. I wasn't going to guess I was going to go someplace and be disappointed. I was just excited for whatever team called my name, and I'm going to take that and get to work there and give that organization all that I have."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"A lot of people did talk about what I can't do, downsides of my game, whatever it may be. I think that I just kind of took that and there are so many other things that I bring to the game, but it's also something that I don't feel like I have a lack of. I think it just wasn't really my role and where I was. But if that's something that's going to be asked of me, I'm going to do what I've always done and make the best of my role and impact the game in every way that I can, which I think is in all facets, whether I'm rebounding and running, I'm playing off the block, playing off the wing, setting the screen, coming off the screen, whatever it may be. So I think if that's going to be asked of me, I've been working, I'm prepared to get there to the league and shake things up."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I think people are going to pick and choose what to focus on, but I know what I bring to the table, and I'm excited to get to Atlanta and show them why they picked me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, I'm really excited. I feel like it's something that I've worked for all my life. I'm really excited to carry the torch that my cousin DeLisha had, next one in the family to get to the league, and I'm going to try to make my impact in whichever I can."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I'm really excited to get there and learn. There's so many amazing veteran players. The Dream staff is very experienced and they have a lot of wisdom that they are going to pass down to me. I'm excited for training camp. I'm sure I'm going to be tested. I'm sure there's going to be a reality check there, but I'm just going to take it in stride and pick up any ounce that I can to just get better."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, Laeticia said it best. We both come from winning programs and a standard of excellence, and I think that the Dream is putting that into place right now. So for us to bring our collegiate experience of winning to the next level, it's going to be great. We have a lot to learn, as well, but I think we can bring some pieces of knowledge and just kind of bring the same work ethic that we had in college and just boost that to be even greater, it's really exciting."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"You mentioned Laeticia, we've been rivals for like four years now. So we ran into each other in the photo room. So we're excited to finally get to play together, throw on the same jersey, and I think we'll be quite the duo to throw up with people like Naz Hillmon, Danielle Robinson, Rhyne Howard. The list goes on and on. I'm excited to get there and play with everyone."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I mean, I don't really pay very much attention to the projections and things. I was just kind of excited to get to the league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"But to your point about three-point shooting and things of this sort, I'm just excited to get to the next level and show what I've been working on. I think at Stanford it wasn't really my role to three-point shoot, it was to play-make, rebound and run, facilitate, run the offense, play out of the high post. And I think when that was my given role, I played it to the highest extent that I could. We did a lot of great things doing that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Now I was a great three-point shooter in high school, and I think now it's just kind of bringing that back to the arsenal. I don't think it ever really left, it's just bringing it back to the forefront. It's been on standby for a while."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I'm excited to get to the A, bring it there, and you know, just kind of prove people wrong in a way, I guess."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,But that's not really me focus. My focus is on getting to Atlanta and winning basketball games.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, when I heard ATL and they said ""Haley Jones,"" I was like, let's get it, that was kind of my attitude about it. I was like, let's get to it. Give my family the hugs, I'm excited to get there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"But with the young core, I think they bring a lot of different things, but I think what I can bring on the court, people always talk about my versatility, so I think that's going to be big at the next level. Being a 6-1 point guard is huge. The vision that you have, the mismatches that you can exploit in a variety of ways, I think being able to rebound the ball and push it and not look for an outlet gives a different look to the game."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I think off the court I try to just be myself and people usually describe that as compassionate, a lot of times goofy, maybe clumsy, but I think I'm going to bring an authenticity about myself. I'm never going to apologize for who I am. The way that I am, I'm proud of who I've become. I'm just going to bring a confident energy, one that's going to look to have fun, make the game fun because that's what it should be. That's why we all play. I'm excited to bring that big ol' personality that I have to Atlanta."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Oh, my God. Hopefully she's listening or going to see this interview. I'm so sorry. I literally got called. Didn't even think to grab my phone. I hugged my mom and dad, my brother. So when I get to my phone I will call her back immediately. That is like the worst first impression to have is missing a call from your new boss."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"The second I get to my phone, no matter how many missed calls I have, missed texts, calling her immediately. But I hope she knows how excited I am to get to the A, make an impact, get to training camp, just get ready to work. I will tell her profusely all of that as soon as we get on the phone."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"I think definitely just my hard work, my work ethic, going in I'm a competitor. No one likes to lose, but just going in, I want to get rebounds, I'm aggressive on the boards, just being versatile, being able to score on all three levels. That's kind of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, it's really exciting getting drafted to the Dallas Wings but to know that Steph Stephanie Soares is also going to be there. I got to play with her a little bit this year. So getting the opportunity to play with her again is really exciting because obviously with her injury this year, I didn't get to play with her the full year, but she has a lot of potential and is a great player, a great person. So I'm excited to get to play with her again."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, it's a great question. I think the biggest thing is just learning to compete through challenges. Obviously, we faced a lot of adversity this year with Steph going out, Coach Fennelly had lost his mom. We had a lot of changes within the program, and so just learning to fight through adversity. Continuing to battle and kind of adapt to the changes, but also just learning how to handle the ball a little better, again, scoring on all three levels. I think all of those things helped translate and are able to help me as I move forward here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, definitely you get a little anxious waiting and you want to know where you're going, but really exciting when you hear your name called and you get to go up on stage, take your picture and get to know where you're going now, and obviously with Steph going there, it's really exciting I get to play with her again."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, I'm super excited to get there. Training camp is going to be tough, but nothing is ever easy. Nothing is ever handed to you. You have to work for it. You have to earn it. Just coming in being aggressive and competitive, competing and just soaking it all up, learning from the veteran players and going from there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, it's really exciting when you hear your name called. You're happy. It's just all the emotions kind of rush to you at once, and you're just excited to get the opportunity to be here, get drafted. Obviously, it's a hard league, and to even be drafted is hard, but making a roster is the next stop."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"So really excited to be drafted, excited to get to Dallas and get into training camp."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, I've never been the biggest or the strongest person on the court, but you have to have the heart and the will to go after the ball. Just kind of knowing when a shooter shoots it, where the ball is going to come off the rim, kind of reading it that way, and going after the ball and just being competitive and battling inside, even if you're not the biggest. I think that's what helps me rebound a lot."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Man, surreal. It's a surreal feeling. Just thankful to God. I give all glory to Him. I wouldn't be here without Him. All the hard work that I've put in allowed me to be in this position. Like I said, I'm just grateful for this opportunity."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I can be a lockdown defender. Like you said, I'm pretty versatile. Can't really put me in a box. I'm going to do whatever it takes. Whatever the team needs I'm going to do it. I work hard. I'm a big guard so I can guard fours, bigger guards, smaller guards. Like I said, I'm really focusing in on bringing that defensive impact."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I was literally just talking to Tamika Catchings. The first time she texted me I was star struck. I was like, this is Tamika Catchings, she has my number, she knows my name, what the heck."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"But no, she's been there. She's been giving me advice and encouraging me. I'm so thankful for her."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"She just told me to be me. She said she knew that I would make it. Just continue to do the things that I've been doing, and she's rooting for me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, I mean, either way it went, I feel like it was going to be a good situation. It was two really good situations. That's why it made it even harder for me to decide. But to go back on everything that I've worked for is for this moment."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I've always had aspirations and dreams of playing in the W. I've watched it growing up. I feel like this is my time. God was giving me this opportunity, and I feel like I had to jump on it. I'm honestly so happy that I made this decision. I'm a strong believer in everything happens for a reason, and this was meant to happen."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Ooh, I'm excited to play with all my teammates at Seattle. We've got another Tennessee Lady Vol over there Mercedes Russell, so I'm excited about that. And then just stepping out on the court and playing against everybody. Like I said, I'm a big fan of the W. I watched it growing up all my life. So I look up to a lot of people in the W. Every team that I play against, I'm just honored to be out there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Things really set in after my name was called. I was walking out and my nerves were high. I walked out and they pulled me over and they showed my this video of my aunt or my cousin Sylvia. She coached for North Carolina and also played in the W. She showed me this video of her speaking and it kind of made me tear up. Just realizing this is what I've worked for. She's always told me that I had what it takes to be in the W, and it's just crazy that it's finally here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I'm so excited to pick her brain. I'm so excited for her to take me in and to be a part of this. They have a great fan base. I'm just excited to get out there. Like I said, I'm always ready to learn, and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help this team."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Well, actually Seattle was probably one of the only places that I didn't have a conversation with. I've talked with a lot of coaches on Zoom, and they was actually one of the ones that I didn't. I'm so thankful that they saw potential in me. But like I said, they come from rich history. Sue Bird, she held it down there. Jewell Loyd, she's a dog. I'm just really excited."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I'm just going to do whatever I need to do. I'm going to continue to be me, be a great teammate, be a sponge, be ready to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"None. I had no idea where I was going. The city was beautiful. It was amazing. The only thing that I've known about Seattle prior to going for the NCAA Tournament was Grey's Anatomy. I only knew it was a pretty beautiful city. But no, I did not have any clue on where I was going to end up."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,I'm excited to embark on that new journey.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yes, actually I did. Yeah, I did talk to all the coaches. We got on the phone. They were excited, I was excited. Just made me want to go there right now."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Honestly, the whole draft I could see Coach. She was in the corner. I'm over here, hands, palms sweating. Every time I would look at Coach, it calmed me down. I would just look over at Coach, she would be just looking around and I was like, all right, I'm good, I'm good. But that goes to show you she brings me peace. I can be myself with her, and I love her so much. She's done so much for me, and whatever I can do to give back to her, I'm going to jump and do it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Definitely playing at Tennessee has prepared me for the next level. You look at Tennessee, you see Candace Parker, you see legends that come out of Tennessee. I feel like just having those people that came before us, they came back and helped us out. I feel like that's been a good thing. I feel like also with the coaching staff, they were amazing on and off the court. I feel like they're the best in the country."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"As far as Mercedes, I haven't spoken to her, but I'm going to get on that real soon. I remember coming on a visit, I don't remember how old I was, but she was there and I was looking up to her. So I'm excited to play with her."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Man, it's crazy. I still can't even believe it. Like I said, I have to give all glory to God because without Him I wouldn't be here. My family, the people who supported me, like I said, it's still a blur. I probably won't even realize this until long, long, long down the line. So I'm just trying to take everything in, but I'm just so grateful."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Okay, so we actually we actually made that handshake maybe a week before the draft. We were like, we're going to be one of those cool people, like we're going to do a handshake. We showed everybody in the office, so we probably did it about 12 times."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,But it was cool. I think we looked pretty cool. We pulled it off.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"And then Rennia texted me today just telling me she was proud of me and she was rooting for me. But that just goes to show that the sisterhood is real. We stay in touch. Like I said, I look up to them. They brought me in and they showed the ropes to me, and hopefully I was able to do that with somebody else. But like I said, it's a sisterhood, and it means more here at Tennessee."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Do you think so? I mean, it's nothing too crazy. Actually, it was just thrown together last minute. I got it yesterday. I didn't want anything too crazy, but I needed something that had to make a statement. I feel like this was the right fit for me. I think I pulled it off."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's great to be here. This is, I think, one of the most exciting nights on the WNBA calendar. We're going to watch a group of extremely talented athletes really get ready to start the next phase of their basketball journey. I've had such fun with them today and also had fun calling them all."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Thank you. So there's no one that wants the full season and full playoffs more than I do. But again, as I said and the question is the right one, talk about how do you build a sustainable model to fund it. Because remember, travel is an operating expense. It's an operating expense on your budgets and your company's budgets and an operating expense on our budget. It's not something typically you can go out and get funded through either equity investment, debt investment. It has to come from the revenues of the company. Every place I've ever worked, every client I ever served in my prior life, that's how you fund operating expenses. So it has to come from revenue and revenue growth, if you're going to expand it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I feel comfortable we've been growing revenue at the league, which is why I feel comfortable with this particular program this year, and yes, in the longer term, as we look at a next media rights deal, as we get more corporate partners and more significant amounts as we drive the valuation of our franchises up. You saw the news when Seattle did their capital raise this year, they had a post-money evaluation of 150 million. That's being driven by their revenue, which is being driven by the lift that we're all seeing and the momentum in women's sports. This is how you fund things like this is, build a revenue model, take a look at expenses, too, but have enough dropped to the bottom line that you feel comfortable funding something for a decade or more."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That's how we're looking at all of our expenses, not just charter travel but all travel experiences, because there's other things the players would want, too, as they travel that we'll take a look at over time."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, we intend to do more, as I said, the release said. But we do need some patience and time to build it so that we feel comfortable funding something more substantial as we get into our ensuing years."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now, next year will be a challenge because it's an Olympic year. So that's always a challenge because we have to take a month off or approximately a month off from the league as we support our national team players, not just in the USA women's national team but also -- I think last year we had 23 players from 13 different foreign countries. This year, obviously rosters aren't set yet, and when we get that number we'll provide it. But we're globalizing our player population, as well, and when you think about what that means going forward."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to continuing the conversation, but it'll always be on the list for me until we get the full program."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, thanks. So there's a lot being obviously talked about and written, and what a great day to be talking all the time about the momentum and players staying, players coming. I think we have a fabulous draft class this year. Everyone we were kind of looking at to come into the league, and I think our general managers were looking at, is in this draft class this year. Obviously, there were a few that decided to stay."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Look, I was a Division I both college basketball player and lacrosse player. If I could've played for one more year -- by the way, if I could go back and play today at the age of 58, I would go back and play today. I totally understand it. I understand the opportunities to stay in college."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But I think, again, we're going to have such depth in our next few draft classes, so I'm not worried about the extra COVID year. I think next year technically is the last year of the extra COVID year, and so if players decide to stay, I think some players were looking at where they might fall in the draft class and things like that. I think it's great that we have these options and the depth in this league and the quality of play in this league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Just on your question of coming off the outstanding March Madness tournament, I was in Dallas. It was amazing. It was everything you thought it was going to be but more. And then the viewership being on ABC on Sunday -- we do so great when we're on ABC, as well, at the WNBA. But we do need to do, as I've stood up here and said before, a great job of taking kind of these really star players who have huge followership, whether through their NIL deals or just through their social media following."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Remember, the NIL deals have been actually a positive for players coming into our league if they have national brands like Gatorade and Nike. They're our partners, too. They can come in with those NIL deals and then they can get activated even more broadly because those are our deals."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now when they are local deals for just the local area, maybe that is not as relevant. But certainly these national NIL deals -- I was wrong about that. I thought it's just another area for women to be undervalued in sports, but I was wrong about that because the NCAA women's basketball players have been highly successful in signing these NIL deals. I think it's a huge positive for us."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So we'll welcome them in and especially them building their personal brands. They come in with a huge following, social media following, and look at some of these generational players that are going to come in the next two years."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think the attention on the women's basketball game, I went from the Final Four in Dallas to the Masters. Everybody at the Masters was talking about women's basketball. It was pretty incredible."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now we have to make sure we take these great players and as they come into our league we continue to market them, put the marketing dollars behind them. I know Phil Cook, our CMO, is working very hard on making sure that integration from NCAA into the WNBA is something that we can take advantage of that momentum, rather than what we might have done in prior years, which is okay, now they're in our league and they're on a team where you don't have the loyalty of that college town following them. Now we've got to bring those fans along with us."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think the attention this year on the March Madness tournament for the women's national champion -- think about LSU and 102 points. How many points were scored by the winning team in the men's final? 76. Think about that, nearly 30 more points in the same amount of time scored by LSU, and just what a great testament to the quality of the game and these players coming into our league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Great. As soon as I give a timetable, I assure you it won't be right. So I'm not going to give a timetable. We might have been talking about it, but as you know I have a philosophy that we needed to have more transformation of the league economics because the last thing we want to do is bring new owners in who are going to fail. I had a philosophy, and I think it was the right one because I think the valuations are going up for all of our teams and all of our assets. Because it's not just about a valuation of the franchise. It's the patch on the uniform, it's a placement on the courts, it's an ad buy, it's a media right fee -- all the things that new owners coming into the league from these cities that we think will be great cities for the WNBA will benefit from."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I am so glad we didn't rush it. Yes, now it's time to really get into the due diligence phase with some of these cities, some of these ownership groups. Start deciding on what an expansion draft might look like. We've got great drafts coming up in the next few years."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As I said, yes, I'd love to bring in at least two teams over the next few years and maybe longer term four. So that's where we are today, and that's what we're working on."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so I'm glad you just used that word ""unique,"" because I think her situation is unique. I was able to spend about two and a half hours with Brittney about a month or so ago, talking with her about her return to the league, talking about physical, mental, all the things. Obviously, her story is going to be incredible when she chooses to share it. She is just inspiring. That's all I'll say."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, we've been working substantially with our security experts, with the Phoenix Mercury, with Brittney's team about -- given her unique conditions -- some things that we'll do this year. By nature of the fact that it's a security plan, it'll be confidential. We're not going to share the details of that security plan. Obviously, people will know where she's playing and when. But we'll keep those -- rest assured, we're working on it because it is a unique situation. I think we all want to protect all of our players. So we're looking at additional security for all of our players, not just Brittney, but Brittney definitely being a unique case this year."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,We've worked on that plan and we're putting some finishing touches as we get into training camp and then into the regular season. Thank you.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's a great question. We're often asked about that roster size question. We think today our rosters are the right size. We've talked obviously with the Players Association about that. We've talked about the 22-year age. We've talked about a lot of different things, as we're thinking about the league quite differently than we thought about it in the past."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think for now the roster sizes are set for this season into next. But that'll be for sure a discussion in the next round of collective bargaining, as will a variety of other issues. And I think with expansion on the horizon, my personal view is to give 12 to 24 and hopefully more roster spots will be something obviously that expansion will afford us. So to do something shorter term with roster size for the 12 teams versus bringing in 24 new players or opportunities for 24 players, I think is the right answer. It helps, again, extend us into two new cities where you expand fandom. And that just all is part of transforming and growing the league versus adding a spot here or there, which actually doesn't do any of that, quite frankly."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It does give a few opportunities to a few more players, but I think in this case we're looking to expand the opportunities for players broadly. One of the ways to do that is expansion. So that's what we'll be looking at in the future."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So obviously one thing I learned in my prior life, where I had to conduct a lot of investigations, is that these things do take time. The investigation is ongoing. We'll definitely share an update when it's ready. I am letting the lawyers do their work. So no update at this time, but the investigation is ongoing. No timeline, either, because again, depending on the outcome of the investigation, but we will share the findings when we've completed the investigation."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so the overall draft class, I think the quality of the draft class is outstanding. The personalities of this draft class, as I've learned today by spending the day off and on with them, is great. I think you're going to see obviously there's -- you all have your mock drafts and I know you know these players and what they're capable of on the court. I think you're going to see them integrate and assimilate into the league very quickly. I think you're going to see a lot of them fighting for starting positions."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think it's going to be a tough choice on Rookie of the Year already this year. I'm going to tell each of them when I come up and read their names that their goal is to get into training camp, work hard and make a roster and ultimately get a starting position, and I think you'll see that in this class this year. They're really, really a talented class."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, all the discussion on roster sizes and expansion, but you want to make sure you're doing it not in just adding, adding, adding, just because you don't want to degrade the quality of the game. That's one that's important to protect. I don't think the quality has ever been better in this game right now, the women's game, both at the collegiate and at the professional level. That's why I think this draft class is going to be great and the next few years is going to be great."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But we've got some veterans out there vying for same roster spots, who are playing at the highest level of their game, as well. It's going to be an interesting season to see what's happening with the teams and the free agency and now these rookies coming in fighting for those spots. I think it's going to be great."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, again, I do think we'd love to have a resolution prior to the season tip. Again, I'm letting the lawyers do their work. That's what a commissioner should do. These things do take time. But I agree -- I don't disagree that it would be important to get a resolution by the season tip. We're working hard on that. These are complicated investigations typically that require a lot of time and interviews of a lot of different people."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, and just to the competitive balance thing, I think everybody is talking about the two super teams out there. But I see some teams -- we're going to have a ton of competitive balance in this league this year and a ton of parity, just like the college game had this year with No. 1 seeds losing. That didn't happen in the women's game five, ten years ago. Just really proud of the product that's on the court right now, both at the collegiate level and as a feeder system into the WNBA."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, the number one thing to capitalize on the momentum is to continue the plan around marketing the players into household names and building rivalries."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We have an enormous opportunity this year to build fandom around rivalries in this league, so no matter which team a fan might be following, we've got to build compelling content so that that rivalry or those players that you follow are part of what you want to do every other night or every third night as these players get on the court and we get the viewership and we get the fans in the seats."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That's the number one thing, especially in advance of thinking about all the disruption in the broadcast and media world around linear, around streaming. Streamers are being disrupted because they were disrupting linear. Households using TVs, people using TVs are going down, but what does that mean? More people are using the devices that they have to stream games, and we've got to be in that game, as well. Those are all the things that we need to capitalize on the momentum."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"There's no doubt like what just happened with the NCAA and the number of viewers for both that Friday night, the Sunday night and just the enormous capitalization on people waking up to say, this game is great, and people now who have watched it, they'll come back."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's an excellent question and one where clearly Becky is setting the stage as a role model, especially given her number of years in the NBA as an assistant coach and then coming to the WNBA as a head coach and winning the championship, the WNBA Finals her first year."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really an important question as you think about, but I think a rising tide lifts all boats in this area, especially when you look at the compensation of coaches and assistant coaches."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're so proud of the diversity we're achieving in our coach and assistant coach -- nine out of 12 of our head coaches are now women, and 77 percent of our assistant coaches are women. Of that, 70 percent are women of color or people of color. Really just an amazing transformation of that part of the league, the diversity and that pipeline to feed into becoming the next head coaches, whether it's in the WNBA, which I hope, or even in the college game, where they struggle a little more with women coaches more broadly, given our numbers."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really proud of what our owners -- this is something, the owners actually appoint and pay the coaches, that our owners have stepped up to do. I think it's something we have our eye on, we had our eye on as soon as I came into the league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With Bethany Donaphin's leadership about diversity and coaching, we've really made enormous strides in a short period of time that I didn't think were possible. Those numbers I threw out were proof that you can build a pipeline of diverse coaches who are going to really be the future of this game from a coaching perspective and then pay them. That's how I think our owners are thinking of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,Right. I remember the first time I did it was in my living room with my two children as my stagehands. Literally we were steaming in my dryer the jerseys right before because they came all wrinkled in a box. It's really good to be here in New York City at Spring Studios. It's really going to be fun.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But personally for me, calling those players, as I said in my lead-in, calling them, having the excitement in their voices that you are going to make their dreams come true. I met their parents and their families today, as well, in a session, and they're so excited. Just to see that you can have that impact and that then they're a role model for future girls and boys to look up to. Favorite part of the job without a doubt. Handing out the WNBA Finals trophy is great, and the rings. But this night is unique because it's a new chapter in all of the lives of these 36 players who will be drafted tonight."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Definitely excited, as you can tell in my voice."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"It's a beautiful feeling. I wasn't able to watch the whole draft, but I know my teammates got drafted. So huge testament to Coach for being able to bring all these great girls together and make history and now we're all living our dream. I'm excited and I can't wait to see what the future holds for all of us."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"To find the beauty in your struggle and embrace your journey. I think once I was able to do that, things started to open up for me in the best way possible. I was able to maintain. I was able to stay consistent. I was just happy me. Definitely finding beauty in my journey and just embracing it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"Yes, Toledo, Ohio, huge ""thank you"" to you guys for supporting me. My city is behind me. They are behind me. I'm going to be so far away, but I know in my heart they're going to be so close. So thank you to Toledo, Ohio. Thank you to Toledo Rogers for leading the way for me and just sticking behind me. It's not over with, Toledo. We're still in it. So let's continue to do what we do."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"This is definitely a dream come true. This is something that I've prepared myself for since I was six years old. I would tell my younger self, I would actually congratulate her. I would tell her how proud I am of her for listening to her parents, number one, for not being a follower, being a leader and being very hardworking. I never quit on myself. I'm definitely very proud of myself."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"I definitely know that they're rebuilding a little bit. I got a chance to talk to the staff, and I fell in love with their staff at first sight. Head coach is amazing. Coaching staff is amazing. So I can't wait to get a chance to go out there. They got some good vets there that I know are going to put me under their wing. I'm ready to learn. I'm ready to win and just do whatever I can do to help the team succeed and do what we can do."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"Yeah, that's going to be crazy. My teammates are a lot bigger than me, so they spared me a lot. But I know when they're playing against me, they won't spare me. In practice I got spared, but I think playing against them, they're definitely going to show me that they're there. I probably won't be guarding them. So I'm going to make sure my teammates lock them up, because it won't probably be me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,But I'm excited for all of us. Everything we've been able to accomplish. I know the sky's the limit for all of us.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"I know that hard work won't be a problem for me. What it'll be for me is just make sure I'm asking questions and taking pride in it. I'm going to be a rookie, but I definitely want to use the vets in the best way possible by learning from them, asking them to watch film with me, asking them to work out with me and just taking it all in for those two weeks."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"Of course I want to make the team, but I definitely want to get as much knowledge as I can. Hopefully when it's all over, I'll be on the team for sure."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"I won't even have to keep her in my head because I know she's a call away. So if I'm feeling anything, I know I can call her and cry. I know I can call her and express how I'm feeling. I know she's going to always be here for me. I'm definitely excited to know that I was coached by somebody that will be here for the rest of my life, and I love her for that for sure."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"I mean, it's just really special. I'm thankful, first, to God just for putting me in this position but also thankful to everybody in Indiana, just because they saw something in me and I'm just ready to get there and get to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, we talked quite a few times. She was super excited to get to know me. She was very welcoming, and I got to talk to the entire staff, and it just almost made me feel at home even before this was a real reality. So, I'm just really thankful to everybody there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, I mean, first off, everybody that has a COVID year definitely has a tough choice because you could either be somewhere where you've known the system, you've been there for four years or however many years it may be versus coming into this new system, grown-ups and it's almost like you're starting over."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"It took a lot of thought because if I could go back to South Carolina again, I absolutely would because it was so much fun. But I just knew I had to do what was best for me, and I definitely think just coming to the league, and I say that just because I've always wanted to do this. I've always wanted to be a professional basketball player and I just felt like this moment was right."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Usually if I feel any doubt, if I feel any second-guessing, I can say I'm just not going to do it. But I was just very confident in myself, so I didn't want to make a different decision because I'm going to trust my gut."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"She was like, we're reunited and we're teammates again, and I was like, and it feels so good. You know the song? That's really what it was."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,Honestly super excited to be with Henni again. It was really great playing with her in South Carolina. To already have that type of connection I think it really is just going to help us.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, just being able to learn from everyone that's there already, that includes the rookies from last year, because they already have that pro life experience, so just being able to learn from them. But also to kind of be who I am and just continue to compete. I think everybody on the Fever now they're going to compete, and we're going to work hard. I'm just really excited to get that started with everyone."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"You know, she's helped a lot. I think she's just helped me be the player that I am right now. Over the past four years she has been able to help guide my steps into what it is to be a pro, guide my habits, and for her to be in the crowd with the rest of our South Carolina crew is just amazing."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Just being confident and also being confident in your leadership skills. I think that's going to be the biggest thing, making sure I'm able to use my voice, talk about what I'm seeing on the court just so I can be able to help my teammates. But also just the physicality that I bring, trying to just be a dominant post player."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"It feels good. I'm excited to get in that Fever jersey, get with my teammates and really get to work. I think it's going to be an exciting season."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, just the way that we compete and the way that we work. I think we have all just put in a lot of work. God has really blessed us, bringing us all together at South Carolina, and for us all to be at this draft is just something that's really special, and it's honestly a dream come true because everyone that's here, not just on South Carolina, has put in so much work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"So, Coach Staley and the entire staff has helped us. They developed us into the players that we are, so it's exciting for it all to be coming together."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"I mean, maybe in a sense, but I think it's almost like coming from high school into college because you're new and everybody already has experience, whether it's a new coach or not. I think it's going to be a little bit different that I'm going to have to adjust to, but I definitely think the coaches are going to be able to help me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, it feels really great to be in the league playing against the best women's basketball players ever, and I really just hope to continue to grow the Fever basketball. I think we're going to do really great things this year, and I'm just super excited for it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"I'm pretty confident just because of just simply spacing. I think it's going to allow me to be able to work a little bit better. Just being able to watch the pros prior to joining the league you can just see how they can just get to work, whether they make the shot or not. But just to be able to have that, it's going to be pretty nice, I think."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Honestly, every single person. One, because I don't want anybody specific coming for me, but two, just because this has been a dream of mine. So, to be able to compete against people that have a lot of experience, they can only help me grow. So, I'm really excited for that because I've always dreamt of this. So, to be able to be here, be in this moment and almost be on the court with them is pretty crazy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, I'm going to be excited just to do that, but at the same time, we're on the court, so I definitely want to compete and make it really hard for her, but it's pretty cool to play against people that you look up to, and Candace is somebody that I look up to all the time. So, I'm really excited for that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"It's really special. I think it's just cool to see everybody not just cheering me on but the entire team, everybody that's here getting drafted, cheering us on. It just feels nice to have a good group of people behind you that want to see you succeed."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"That's a great question. Just knowing me, I would say winning every single game, and I still think that can happen. I think we're going to have a great team that's going to compete. We're going to continue to play for each other."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"So just getting a lot of wins. I think that's the most important part, but also growing as players."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"So I'll answer the Walnut question. Walnut is my dog. He's getting boarded right now. So he's not very happy that he wasn't invited to New York with me, so I'll have to buy him some Fever gear to make up for it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I mean, in terms of what I can bring to Indiana, I just feel like I don't know what skills necessarily are going to translate anything like that, but I do know that my passion for the game, my competitiveness, my grittiness and my willingness to do whatever the team needs on any given night will be there and that will translate. I'm excited to get there and see what my coaches want from me and do that to the best of my ability."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, first off, as a team we were -- the first No. 1 seed ever for our team. We won the most games and everything like that. So we were just, I think, set the program up for a lot of really good success in the future, which means a lot to me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I think as an individual, I was just able to kind of become more mature in my skill set. I played a lot at the point guard this year, which I hadn't in previous years. So I think I was able to just fine tune some of those skills, the leadership aspects, the handling the offense, really having the ball in your hands a lot."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,I think it was the right decision for me.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I didn't really know what it would feel like. I knew it would be amazing, but I think I was just more -- just really grateful and full of emotion when I heard my name called, especially being there with my dad, who had been taking me to Indiana Fever games since I was six, seven, eight years old. It was just two hours up the road from Louisville, Kentucky, where I'm from. We got to go to those games and watch Tamika Catchings, watch Katie Douglas, watch them win that championship."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"To get called was surreal but to get called by a team you've been going to with your dad since you were really little, I think just made it that much more special."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I think it would mean a lot to me. I think I was able to win a good amount in college, so I can bring some of those characteristics over, but I really think looking at that roster, some of the young talent on it, that's super exciting. You obviously have Aliyah Boston, who we all know is amazing and going to have a great impact on the team. And then NaLyssa Smith, Queen Egbo, Destanni Henderson. The list goes on and on. To be able to play with that much talent, that much young talent and come in with them and learn from them and grow with them, I think it's something that I'm really excited about."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, I think I knew the Fever were interested, but you never know until draft night obviously happens. I wasn't getting my hopes up or anything like that. Was just keeping an open mind."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I knew the Fever were a team that obviously just playing in Indiana for the past five years, the community is so special for me. The community is so excited about women's basketball. I was really sad to leave Indiana, but now obviously I'm staying here, so I'm super grateful for that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Like I said earlier, my dad would take me to probably four or five games every summer of the Fever. So I think just to be able to see those strong women, like I mentioned, Tamika Catchings, Katie Douglas, Briann January, see how hard they competed, how tough they were, how much passion they had for the game, I think I modeled myself off of them and it was huge and very instrumental in the development of my own game."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I mean, it was unbelievable to have her here. She means the world to me. She means so much to me, and I can't even begin to state how much of an impact she's had on obviously the player I am but the person I am, the woman I am to where I feel really prepared entering this next phase of my life because I've had five years under the best coach, the best leader, the best strong woman that I could possibly look up to."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"To be able to share a night with her, it was just really special."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, this was the first year that I was the main point guard on the floor. I had the ball in my hands the most. I was running the offense, getting my teammates where they needed to be. Then obviously just the leadership aspect on both ends of the floor that comes with that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"So I think just fine tuning those point guard skills, using my voice, getting my teammates where they need to be and really being that extended coach on the floor were the main things."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I think one of the things that was the most special to me in my five years at Indiana was just to see the excitement in the community of women's basketball grow, to where I'm at now, and it just seems like obviously people are crazy about basketball in Indiana, but they're crazy about women's basketball in Indiana."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"We were able to kind of build that fan base at Indiana that was so special to me, and then obviously at the professional level I think that excitement just takes a next step up."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Hopefully we have a lot of Indiana Hoosier women's basketball fans there now during the summertime, huge Indiana Fever fans."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, first of all, as a point guard, who wouldn't want to have Aliyah Boston to pass to in the post? That's about as much of an automatic bucket as you can get. I've played with her before at USA Basketball, and I think obviously we all know what she can bring on the court, but just the person that she is off the court, how much she loves the game, how genuine of a person she is, how kind of a person she is. I just couldn't ask for a better person to go on this journey with."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,To say I'm excited to be her teammate is definitely an understatement.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, obviously the mid-range is my favorite shot. Anybody that watches me knows that. But I think a part of my game that I've always known I could be good at is finishing at the rim. I worked countless hours with Coach Box, our assistant coach at Indiana, on different finishes, getting to a spot and finishing over bigger, stronger, quicker defenders. Obviously you can't be a one-dimensional player at the next level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,So me getting all the way to the rim in addition to my mid-range and my three is just going to hopefully serve me well in terms of making a roster and contributing.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"Just my ability to learn. I think that's the biggest compliment when it comes to me, being able to take in things and listen and just being able to adapt, do things that coaches need from me, teammates need from me. So being able to be in all different aspects."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"It definitely shows the hard work that I've put in. Especially coming into college. you're expecting to score, you're expecting to be the leading scorer of a team because that's what you're used to. Just being able to establish another role and be great at that and build all-around character, it shows my growth, my discipline and my patience. Just to see that the Minnesota Lynx was able to see that, it's a blessing to be there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"Just to begin with, she's somebody we trusted. She's been through it all, many years of basketball. Her knowledge is through the roof, so we trust everything she says. For her to have four of us here, it shows that we trust her, we believed in her and she believed in us throughout the whole entire way."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"Mainly being able to balance both. You get so caught up in getting stops and whatever the case may be and only taking one or two shots per quarter because you're just so caught up in getting those stops. Just being levelheaded when there are games where I'm scoring and making plays, and on the other end I'm being passive on defense. So just being able to balance out."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"It's an amazing experience really because this group of girls have been through life together. These four years haven't been only about basketball, but it's about growing as women together. Being able to be with them on one of our biggest nights has just been an amazing experience."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Yeah, so I've been in a background where winning has been my culture. I've been winning for most of my life. Obviously very successful at South Carolina. I want to bring that winning culture to Atlanta. I know that that is their plan. That is what they're trying to do. They're on the rise right now, and that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to bring a winning culture into the program."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Yeah, Atlanta is a great city. I love Atlanta. It's only about three and a half hours from South Carolina. So I know the Gamecocks are going to show up loud and proud."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Rhyne is a phenomenal player. Obviously she was in the SEC and I had multiple opportunities playing against her, and I also played against her in high school. Just a phenomenal player, and I'm excited to finally be with her instead of playing against her. So it'll be exciting."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Coach Staley is a phenomenal coach. I mean that wholeheartedly, not just for her coaching style, but as a person she cares so deeply for us. When I came here I had a vision, but she also had a vision for me. She said, L.A., don't worry. That's what she would always say, because obviously I'm not getting as many minutes as I would at a different program. She said, L.A., don't worry, I got you. She stood with that promise, and I'm here now because of her and because of the coaching staff that believed in me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,I'm so thankful for who she is and what she has done for my journey.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Wow, I did not know that. That is amazing to hear."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Playing on the national team, playing for Canada has been something that I take pride in. Obviously I'm wearing my Olympic necklace because it just means so much for me. But what means the most to me is those little girls that are looking. I have a nonprofit, and building up the women that are underserved and those women that are not getting those exposures, like the powerhouses in the United States and the bigger countries that have that, is my biggest goal."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"All those Canadians and all those people that are not only Canadian but in West Africa in countries that are underserved and overlooked, you can make it. I promise you can because I was that kid, and I'm on the biggest stage now. I'm trying to pave a way for all those young women. So yeah, just keep going, because trust me, basketball is on the rise for women."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Oh, it's going to be all business, for sure. It's going to be a lot of trash talking. We are so competitive even in practice, so I can only imagine playing against them. But it's going to be such a surreal moment to be able to play against your teammates on the highest level because not a lot of people can say that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Defense is my passion. That's something that I prided myself on. I'm lengthy, I disrupt and I'm going to go after it. That's something that I can promise to Atlanta Whether it's a night that I get a couple minutes or a lot of minutes, I'm going to go out there and give it my all because it's something that I've always prided myself on is defense and trying to get possessions for my team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Eyes wide with surprise. Pulls phone out of pocket.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, he has done everything he needed to do. We appreciate all the work that he has put in. It's been a long, whatever, six, seven weeks of this. He is putting himself out there, available."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's all hands on deck. We are going with our initial start, normal rotation, and we'll see how the game plays out. We have no idea how this game is going to play out, but it's great to have everybody available. Even Vic Oladipo is here with us. He is not going to play, but he is here just to pour everything into this team and this game tonight to make sure we get this thing back to Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know at this point. There's no guarantees about it. Obviously, these are unusual circumstances. I'm just going to read the game. He is going to be available. I'm not going to disrupt everything initially. It's not realistic for him to step into the role that he was doing before. But it sure is great just to have everybody here, all of those guys available, and having Vic now here. We just feel whole. We're focused on getting this game tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, our guys will be able to take that quality the rest of their careers that grit, the perseverance, the toughness, the ability to compete and put yourself out there for everybody to judge and to be able to handle different things, adversity, all that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'll speak for everybody in our locker room and the organization. You know, congratulations to the Denver Nuggets organization. They are a class act and they are one hell of a basketball team. One hell of a basketball team that we couldn't really find obviously enough solutions to be able to get us over the top."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know, those last three or four minutes felt like a scene out of a movie. Two teams in the center of the ring throwing haymaker after haymaker, and it's not necessarily shot making. It's the efforts. Guys were staggering around because both teams were playing and competing so hard. That's what this league should be about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"There's no regrets on our end. There's just sometimes where you get beat, you know, and Denver was the better basketball team in this series. That's about as hard -- I don't know how long it would take me to go through the autopsy of this Final game, but I would say that it will probably rank as our hardest, competitive, most active defensive game of the season, and it still fell short."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And probably our second-highest rated game would have been Game 4, and we fell short by double-digits. That gives you a good indication of how good this Denver Nuggets team was in this series but also throughout the course of the season and all of the playoffs. They were the superior team in every series. They deserve this championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we would have liked to be able to climb the mountaintop and be able to get that final win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But I think this is a team that a lot of people can relate to. If you ever felt that you were dismissed or felt that you were made to feel less than. We had a lot of people in our locker room that probably have had that, and there's probably a lot of people out there, you know, that have felt that at some time or another."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But also the way this team handled setbacks and adversity, you know, to develop a collective grit and perseverance. I mentioned this before that hopefully these are lessons that will transcend this beautiful game that hopefully these are lessons that we can pass along to our children that even though it is sport, that you can learn lessons of life from this game that you can persevere that you can handle what people may view as mini-failures along the way and become stronger from it and to be able to overcome things and find beautiful things on the other side of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Now, obviously, we didn't get the final win, but sometimes that's true in sport and also in life that you don't always get what you want. But there's no regret from our side. Everybody, staff, player alike in the locker room put themselves out there and put themselves into the team, whatever was best for the team. And the tough pill to swallow is it just wasn't good enough. We ran up against a team that was just better than us in this series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"You have to tip your hat to them. I said it, but they are one hell of a basketball team. They play the right way, they compete, they are well-coached and they have a strong culture. So for this season, they deserve this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"A little bit of that. Sometimes it's just not your time. You know, some of the message that I gave the team is an intimate message just for the group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But what I can tell you, we're all hard-wired to compete for the ultimate prize. But you also want to develop lifelong memories and a brotherhood and a bond that you'll be able to carry on from years from now that we've been able to go through something that's memorable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I told each one of the guys, I love them. I love this team, and I'm just super grateful that we are able to go through all of the experiences, even the tough times during the year, to be able to have a season like this. This is one for the journal books, right. I don't know about all the guys journalling, but this is certainly one that I'll journal and remember this team forever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Years from now, I'll bump into some of these guys and we'll have this bond, even though we didn't get that final prize."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It's just a really tough call and I'll probably have to wrestle with that all summer. I've never been in an experience like this. I just know that the way this game was played is totally different than -- you can't even compare it. It's another sport in the regular season.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But first round, this is totally different, the way this game was played. Second round, totally different. Even the Conference Finals, the physicality and the way that they play, and I think they should have. This is what it should be about, is let the players decide."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But that's the hardest-played, most physical competition you can have, and that would be a tough thing for a guy that's been out for two months that hasn't had any kind of ramp up. But that won't save me from thinking about that for the next few weeks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,All right? Appreciate all of you sticking around and we'll see you down the road.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, my jumper was broke all series. I didn't play well offensively. To my capabilities."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But they know what I'm capable of. They see me every day in practice. The confidence they were giving me every day was what good teammates do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I just stayed with it. Even tonight, it wasn't my best shooting night, but I just kept playing hard. That's all you can control is your effort. I could have scored zero points. I don't care, we won a championship. Can't nobody tell me nothing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I don't really think you can put it into context. Nikola, he does so many things for our team. He's so good of a basketball player. I don't really think people understand how good of a basketball player he is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But to do this where we're happy for him and we're happy for everybody on the team, but Nikola, he led us all Playoffs with his passing some games, scoring other games. This was a historic run. I don't know how you can say he's not the best big man ever really. He's one of the all-time best basketball players. I don't care what anyone says. I think he's one of the all-time best players to ever play this game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"To be on this team, he makes it easy for the rest of us. But we've got so many good players on this team, man, we're happy we got to do it with this group of guys because we don't know if we'll be together how much longer, but to do it with this group of guys, it feels amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, to me, that's not really that good of a game. I didn't think I played that good all series. I don't know what was going on with my shot. I really don't care. I'll fix it in the offseason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, it was good to be able to get a couple shots to go this clincher. I'm not even supposed to be here, to be honest with you. After everything I've been through, I'm not really supposed to be a World Champion."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But to do it with this group of dudes after everything that -- I can't describe it. I look back on everything, how hard I worked, and it just feels surreal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I'm glad Coach took me out and put him in. He got that put-back bucket and then two big free throws. That's what this team is about. We're really selfless. As long as we win the games, no one really cares. That stems from how we are as an organization, but also Nikola, our best player, how he is. He doesn't care if he scores, assists, rebounds as long as we win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, Bruce has been huge for us all Playoffs. We're excited for him because he's going to get paid. He's going to get paid. He was amazing for us all Playoffs, off the bench. We just kept telling him be aggressive, even though his first half didn't go amazing making shots-wise. He hit that big bucket down the stretch, made those two free throws. He was amazing for us all Playoffs. It wasn't just tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, we made some adjustments, but that's a closeout game. I feel like that game was just intense and it was physical. People were missing shots. Like it wasn't a pretty basketball game. But that's what winning a championship is about. You've got to be able to win it in many different ways."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We didn't shoot the ball good all game. I didn't shoot the ball good. As a team we didn't shoot the ball good. But to win a championship that's what it takes. That's what's different about the Playoffs and the regular season. Forget about the stats, forget about the shooting percentage. It's just about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I forget. I think he was just trying to tell us what he saw in the game. But Joker, he gets animated sometimes. For the most part he's very calm, cool and collected, but if he sees something he knows will work, he's going to make sure all of us on the floor hear what he's saying and follow through with that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Like I said in the interview a couple days ago, his IQ is off the charts. So if he sees something, he's going to let us know that's what we need to do, so I think that's probably what it was."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was really hard to put into words. Still is. Yeah, I couldn't even hold it in. I don't know. I couldn't really hold it in. It was just a surreal moment. Everything was hitting. Everything was hitting at once, from the journey, to the celebration with the guys, to enjoying the moment, to looking back on the rehab, to looking back at myself as a kid, as the other viewer, looking from the crowd in or from the camera lens in, and now looking back at them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was a lot. I couldn't hold it in. It was just something I've been working for my whole life. I think Mike said it, Porter. Every real hooper wants to be on this stage and play in the game and be in this moment. To see it full circle, going from my rehab, not being able to walk, go up the stairs, not just for a month or two. It was for a long time. A lot of different things going through my head. A lot of tears. A lot of blood, sweat and tears, and real ones."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, just to see it full circle and have total belief in myself, have the team have total belief in me, people back home have total belief in me, that's all I could ever ask for, and just to see it like this is amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, I really didn't try to think about it. I just wanted to stay focused. I think that's why I missed so many shots early. There was just so much adrenaline. You want to end it on your home court with all the fans there, your family there. You want to end it on the home court so bad. I just felt my shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,I was overshooting so much that it was short. Every shot was short. Forget -- whatever. That's just a me problem.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"But like I said, that adrenaline kicks in, and you want to do something so bad. That's why I was ready to go at halftime, calm down and reset myself and do whatever the team needs me to do to get the win. What was the question? All right, next question."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,Shoutout to Kyle.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Oh, man, you could hear it in the crowd, just the excitement. We have the best home court for a reason. I just felt like all season long, even the past couple seasons we were hurt. They were just there for us. When we didn't have the energy, they brought us energy. They gave me energy. They gave me energy to come out and do an arrow or make a couple shots or show a little bit more emotion than normal. They would really help me going. That's why everybody loves to play at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I can't shout out these fans enough. I'm so happy for the city of Denver, Kroenkes. We really, really earned this one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,It's surreal to see it through. It's tough to answer these questions right now.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I knew I was going to suck for the first few games. I had to live with that. I knew I wasn't going to put up 40, 50 points in the first few games. I always say, if you go back to the first game in Utah, I picked up the ball in the paint like five times. I could count. I was so lost. I had never felt being that lost on the court before. I just didn't want to go in the paint or jump or land or feel contact. Just how far I've come from that moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I still have different moments where I'm tentative, best word for me to put it, to do certain actions, rebounding among everybody or -- but I've just gotten so much better at that and just putting that behind, not just me, Mike too. I think -- shout-out to Mike. He's gone through so many different injuries and to see him constantly locked in, be a team player, grow his game in different aspects, have an all-around game even if he's not shooting well. It's just really great to see the growth of this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, that first game in Utah, I was -- I don't want to say scared because I wasn't. I was confident but I was so tentative in everything I was doing, and just to see from that game to this game to the Finals game where I've come, it's just -- I'm just happy for myself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I seen a picture of Jok and Embiid running for MVP, and Jok keeps running. I think that just speaks so much to what his mindset is. I got mad at him today in the game because he kept passing the ball. I hit him in the pocket, he has a floater and he'd pass it. Out of bound, turnover. I'm like, bro, just shoot it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"But that's just part of him. That's just his game. That's what makes us so good is, even if he's open and guys are late, you still have to guard him and guard everybody else. We're just an all-around team. You've got to guard every single person on the court, whether they can shoot or not, finish or not. Everybody is a threat. We play so unselfish giving each other spacing, giving each other different looks, knowing that the ball has energy and it will find you when the time is right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I keep bringing up Mike, I thought he was amazing today. I didn't shoot well early, Jok didn't score early, a couple calls didn't go our way, and Mike, we just told him, this is your night. No matter what happens, this is your night. We tried to make an effort to get him going, and he took advantage of it. He kept us in the game for a minute, or whatever. He was just aggressive all night, and that just speaks to our team, wanting to see each other succeed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Aaron Gordon, guarding the best player every night. Knowing he wants to shoot some step-back threes here and there. No, get your ass in the dunker, dunk the ball, and play defense. We're going to win a championship. And he's just so unselfish, he's just -- everybody played a pivotal part."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Jok is the Finals MVP and rightfully so and deserving, and he makes everybody connect and everybody want to win being so unselfish, and I thought down the line everybody was so unselfish for us to get this done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I think for the biggest thing for us, I came off the bench backing up Gary Harris. I just think he had continual trust in my game and what I'm trying to do out there. When I'm bringing the energy, making shots or not, he trusts me to make the right play out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I got on him sometime during the season like hey, we're not your little kids anymore. We're grown men, and if we make a mistake just come talk to us. Just come talk to us. When we weren't that good, he had to have that kind of authority and defensive mindset and just get on us and pull it out of us. Now it's like we know what we need to do to win. We know what to expect from each other, and we can get on each other to push each other to be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just thought he's -- not just this year, but each year that we've been together, he's just grown in how to handle us. I think that's so important, the way you handle people in the locker room on and off the court, and he's done an amazing job of just keeping us positive, coming to timeouts, keeping us positive, moving on to the next play when we make a mistake. Shout-out to Ryan Saunders, shout-out to DA, David Adelman."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's the worst coach ever. No one should take him. Laughter. He's horrible. He's disrespectful. He sucks. Yeah, so he's not going anywhere."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, the best word for me to say is unselfish and having trust in each other. The biggest thing is when we give each other space to work, we allow the defense to make mistakes or our reads to happen. AG just staying patient, knowing that he's going to benefit when the action is done. Mike staying patient, knowing that when Jok rolls, they have to tag and he is one of the best corner wing shooters in the league. He's going to benefit. If they double me, I don't need to force it. I just hit Jok in the pocket and let the play happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"KCP playing defense, knowing we are going to give him a touch here and there and find him in transition. CB doing everything he needs to do to stay on the court. Jeff just being a vet, honestly. DJ knowing he's not going to get in the game too much, but talking to me not just on the court but off the court, keeping me locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,I guess just down the line everybody had a role to play in our success. I'm just so happy for our guys. We really did this s--- together.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I have to say that I had my doubts, as well. It's just natural. Somebody asked me about butterflies. That's what makes you alive. That's what makes you care. When you doubt yourself, that's what makes you try to find a way to turn it around. In whatever sport, in whatever injury, in whatever career you're in, when you go through adversity, it's how you envision and visualize yourself at the end of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Zach LaVine was a big help. We talked throughout the rehab and we were still rehabbing at the time. So I'm asking, are you still doing this, are you still doing this, what should I feel, what should I expect. Gallo, Oladipo, Klay, all those guys have shown that you can do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just wanted to be another guy to be an inspiration for those little kids that even at those young ages have gone through some adversity, knowing that when you put your mind to it, that will take care of itself. It's just the mindset you have to have. I've been such a big mindset guy growing up. It's just crazy to see it through, off ACL. This is fresh. This is a year out of playing, not having a summer to really work on my game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"There's more to come from me. I know if I can do this fresh off an ACL, still having sore days and everything like that, we can do this again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, we're going to find out. It's easy to talk about, but it will be evident early in the game to see if we are playing with that desperation and that urgency that we need to if we are going to close it out tonight here at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But our guys have shown just great focus and discipline throughout the entirety of these playoffs. I think it's 19 playoff games we've played, and from the lead-in week to the first round against Minnesota and throughout, and today, in our shootaround, our guys have been really locked in, focused, and I think they all fully understand what we have and the opportunity that we have in front of us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's not going to be easy, you know, as I told our team, right when we beat the Lakers. This is going to be the hardest thing that we have ever done. KCP is the only guy in that room that's won a championship, and tonight is going to be another example of us trying to achieve something that none of us have achieved, and I think all the guys are excited for the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, that's probably a question best served for Stan Kroenke and Josh Kroenke. I am the beneficiary of that patience, and I'm very, very thankful for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Tim Connelly hired me and brought me to the table here, and my countless conversations in my seven years with Tim, we would always talk about how we had the luxury of working for a group with Stan and Josh and the Kroenke family that is not going to be just a quick trigger. We have to make a move. We have to make a move. They were willing to take a step back and see this thing through."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I'm not really sure where it's from. They own so many different sports teams around the world, but I think it's just in their nature, to be honest. I have gotten a chance to know Stan, know Josh. They are very calm, cool, collected. They don't react. And I'm really thankful for that, and I think our players are, too, because we wouldn't be in this moment if that had not been the course that they chose."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"To be honest, doesn't change anything. If they throw him out there, they throw him out there. But our approach is the same, our game plan is the same, and our energy, discipline and communication have to be the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I feel really fortunate that my father was a CYO coach, a high school coach, a college coach and a pro coach, and seeing him on a day-to-day basis. And then being around coaches like Pete Gillen, who I worked for in college Greg Kampe at Oakland University, Bobby Gonzalez."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"And then Jeff Van Gundy brought me in the league. It wasn't a long time with Jeff, but I learned so much in that brief time with Coach Van Gundy. And then I worked with Mike Brown in Cleveland, and obviously I took a lot from Mike and Mike was so impactful to my career. I wouldn't be a head coach if it wasn't for Mike Brown and the opportunities that he gave me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I worked for Monty Williams, Mark Jackson. So I think when you are a young coach, you want to be everything, and as you get older and you mature, it kind of funnels down and funnels down and then you kind of create your obvious identity of what you want to be and what you believe in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I've had the luxury of being around great coaches my whole life, and you couple that with just staying true to my own self, and then here you go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,I haven't really seen or been able to mingle. I'm not a big mingler. I do my job I go home.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I know for me what is special is when we're on this journey, I am thankful for Doug Moe and the guys that -- players and coaches that were here in the past that have never gotten this far but I know are so proud of what we've achieved to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So guys like Doug Moe, Dan Issel, Alex English, David Thompson, you can go on and on about naming all the guys that have worn this jersey or coached this team and done a hell of a job in doing so. But not much mingling to this point. We'll see what happens."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think for me, you always have to challenge yourself to look in the mirror and get better, and that's something I think myself and the coaching staff throughout eight years have done every season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whenever that previous season is over, we take some time away, and then we get back together in the summer and we take a really honest, in-depth look and figure out, what are our weaknesses, what are our blind spots, how do we improve."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,It's hypothetical to tell all your players to come back better players but you not being willing to come back as a better coach.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I remember a few years ago sitting down with Wes Unseld Jr. and looking a lot at our defense and coming to the realization that we had to simplify things. I think if you simplify things and just are aggressive, the players can go out and do that. You want them going out there and playing and being active instead of thinking."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I think definitely, we continue to, even after this run, whenever it ends, we'll find a way to look at ourselves and try to be even better next season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I slept like a baby. I got up every two hours and cried, you know what I mean. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's funny, I go back to Game 1 in this series and my daughter said to me, my youngest daughter said, ""Are you nervous?"""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I was like, really, at that point, I was not nervous. I was excited about the opportunity. I think the reason that myself, our coaches, our players, are not nervous is because we worked so hard to get here, and we are prepared."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's the most important thing. Our guys are locked in, and we know tonight is going to be a hell of a challenge. We know it's going to be an amazing atmosphere in front of the best fans in the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But all you can do is the work, and then you've got to trust that process to carry it through, and we have great players that I feel really confident are willing and able to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Pat Riley said something many years ago. I used to have it up on my board when I was a head coach in Sacramento, and it talked about the evolution in this game and how you go from a nobody to an upstart, and you go from an upstart to a winner and a winner to a contender and a contender to a champion, and the last step is after a champion is to be a dynasty."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So we're not satisfied. We accomplished something this franchise has never done before, but we have a lot of young talented players in that locker room, and I think we just showed through 16 playoff wins what we're capable of on the biggest stage in the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"The best part about it is the people I just did that with. I love those guys. I love my coaches. Stan and Josh Kroenke are incredible owners. Their support, their continued belief. Calvin Booth, first year as a GM."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"And I just have to say on a personal note a huge thank you to my mother and father. I just spoke to them, let them know how much they're a part of this. Their love and support all along has meant the world to me. My beautiful wife Jocelyn, two daughters Caitlin and Bridget. I'm a really blessed person and I'm really enjoying this moment so don't screw it up by asking a stupid question. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, to your point, the first question, foul trouble, Aaron, Nikola, Jeff, I thought DeAndre played a few minutes but he went out there and did his job. So you couple the foul trouble with, we couldn't make a free throw or a three-point shot and we're down seven at halftime. That was my message at the break, was that we haven't played well, we've had foul trouble, we can't make a shot, and we're only down by seven points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it's a maturation, a continued maturation. We all know that Michael didn't shoot the ball as well as we know he can. That's going to happen at times. This is a great experience for him because I think he realized, as I continue to tell our team, there are no specialists allowed on this squad. If your jump shot is not falling, do something else to help teammates. Not yourself, help your teammates -- defending, rebounding, hustling, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think it's really important, let's not judge Michael Porter just on his shooting in the Finals. Look at his performance in the Western Conference Finals against Phoenix, against Minnesota and more importantly throughout the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Michael is only going to get better, and to have he and Jamal back healthy, this is what I really envisioned a few years ago when we got Aaron Gordon."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Sometimes a dream is deferred, and our dream was deferred for a few years, but we stuck with it, and we added the right pieces. Huge shoutout to Calvin Booth and the job he's done. This is just an unbelievable feeling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I was just joking with Josh, as the champagne is being sprayed all over the place. I said, Josh, I'm a rookie at this. I really don't know what I'm doing but you're used to this. You've won Stanley Cups, Super Bowls."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But our ownership group has been phenomenal throughout this entire process. Eight years is a long time, and very thankful, as I've said many times, in allowing this to get to this point and win a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,Stan and Josh are great owners. They allow us to do our job. I'm just thankful that we were able to add to that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I've never felt any pressure. There was never any pressure. It was just -- I know they love all their teams, but I will tell you this Stan Kroenke grew up a basketball fan. He loves his Rams, he loves every other team he has, but he's a basketball fan. He grew up a basketball fan. Josh played Division I basketball. I think this one is really special for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I have to really make sure I shout out our fans. That atmosphere tonight was incredible. I remember year one eight years ago, and how far we've come and what we've built and the fans are a huge part of that. What really touched me was somebody showed me the video of Game 4 when we were in Miami and to see 18,000, 19,000 people in this building going crazy, they're a part of this. Our fans are a part of this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Huge shout out to Nuggets nation for showing up, representing, and a lot of love for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's been amazing, because you can look at it one of two ways. You can look at it from the basketball perspective, two MVPs, Finals MVP, world championship and everything he's done on the court, and then more important for me you can look at off the court, the relationship, the love that I have for Nikola, his mother and father back in Sombor, Serbia, his brothers Nemanja and Strahinja, his wife Natalija and their daughter Ognjena. They're a wonderful family I've gotten very close to. And I've said this many times before, but Nikola even tonight, he's kind of acting like this was just another game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's never changed with all the success, and he never will. It's just not in his nature."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I love Nikola. Eight years, love Jamal, seven years. Been through a lot. Just for all of us to stay the course, to challenge ourselves, to all get better collectively, individually. Yeah, it's great to be a part of such a historically great player who's an even better person, and I mean that sincerely. This is not coach-talk. Nikola is just a great, great man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It hasn't hit me, and I don't think it's going to hit me tonight because I'm going to drink too much. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"These moments are surreal. I got in the league 22, 23 years ago, and I dreamed of becoming a head coach. Not knowing if I'd ever be given that opportunity. It doesn't come easy, and my father was a head coach once, and he's the best coach I know."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"To get to this point, to win a championship is just, as you reflect upon all the people who helped you get here. My high school coach Bobby Farrell at Seton Hall Prep, my prep school Tom Blackburn who passed away last year, the coaches I worked for in college, Pete Gillen, everybody like Greg Kampe, that gave me an opportunity to grow and improve to get to this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is like a many, many years-long process, and you don't do it by yourself, and from my family, from my wife, from my daughters, from my mother and father, from my three sisters and two brothers and everybody else along the way, I want to say thank you for believing in me and supporting me and just giving me that unconditional love all the time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, it's just a stick-to-itiveness, staying with it, not feeling sorry for yourself. It's one of my favorite moments D.H. Lawrence ""Self-pity."" I hate people that feel sorry for themselves and Michael didn't. I'm not making shots, so what? What else can I do to help this team win a championship. That play where he went between the legs and finished was an amazing play, and that three that he hit you could feel the whole arena, like wow, there is not a lid on the rim. We can actually make shots tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's important for everybody to understand that Michael is a young player. He missed his rookie season. He played nine games last year. I did my radio show a week ago and one of the hosts said, A lot of people in Denver are wondering if you're going to make a change to your starting lineup. After a win, mind you. I said, no, of course not. Michael Porter is our starting small forward, and he's a big part of our future."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know next time he's on this stage, he's only going to be better off for going through this experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"First and foremost, congratulations to the Denver Nuggets. Great franchise. Great team. They deserved it, and they beat us fair and square."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we go, and it's a special bond with this group. We were led by one of the best basketball players on this earth, and he instilled confidence in us. It's kind of one of those things where we don't know how we are going to feel and what we are going to think right this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"But you know, we'll look back at some point and say, hey, it was a great year, great run. But right now, just can't even think about that right this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"Probably how grateful I am to be able to compete with these guys. You never know what the team is going to look like next year, the year after that. I'm just grateful. I learned so much. They taught me so much. I wish I could have got it done for these guys because they definitely deserve it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,But the one thing I'm going to take from it is how grateful I am to be able to compete with them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's been great. I've had some helluva teammates come through and compete with me and give us the opportunity to win a championship, which I still believe, with everything in me, that we will do as a team here, as an organization, as a city in Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"The four years have been great. It's always great to be wanted and loved and appreciated. I don't think that's going to change. But for the time being, like I just said to Nick, I'm grateful, man, that we made it here. Came up short, but I'm blessed. I'm fortunate."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,That I turned the ball over. That's what stood out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,Zero. My ankle is fine. We just didn't win. There's no excuse. They beat us. That's all I got.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,Take it away.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we still got good looks. I think our pace was great. I think they made shots, and we didn't get out in transition as much as we wanted to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,We shot 34 percent or something like that. We got some good looks and just missed them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. We just missed shots. That's what this league is about. We make two or three more shots, that's what it's been for us all year long."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think we did enough to win. You guard well. We're still in position to win. You don't have to score a hundred points to win a basketball game. I think we'll be okay. That's Coach Pat and Coach Spo's job to put together another team, which I'm confident that they will do, and we'll take it from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's the norm. He's been doing that the entire series, since he's been here and been my teammate. We follow his lead. We follow Bam's lead. We follow everybody. We play basketball our way. You attack. It looks good. But we've seen it time and time again. It doesn't motivate me any more or any less. I know he is a champion and he wants to win. Whatever he's out there doing, it's to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"All of them. I think it's all of them. I'm happy for DJ. I'm happy for Jeff. I'm happy for Ish. Literally for everybody. Mikey, he had three surgeries and still came here and helped us win a championship. Jamal, who had surgery and didn't play well at the beginning of the season, like I told you guys, but we all know what he's capable of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"KCP, he brought us the championship, Bruce, Christian Braun. Literally every single player. Every player on this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's good. It's good. We did a job. I think we played the best basketball I'm not going to say in the postseason, but I think we were there playing the best basketball. Today we didn't make shots, but still, we defend."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it's a great journey. Like you said, 41st pick, but that doesn't matter. When you're here, you're a player. They have a couple guys that weren't even drafted and they're still playing and contributing to them to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't know that. That's great. But to be honest, I don't think about the next year. I'm going to ask the coach to give me a couple weeks more off so I can be ready for the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That's supposed to be a joke, and you didn't laugh. Good job, guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, but we have -- it's not the starting unit. It's the whole team. Since day one in San Diego, it was something different about this team. I felt it. I felt some different energy and every day since then I had the same feeling. I'm not really optimistic guy, but that gave me hope that we can do something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, we have an impact on things, but of course Americans are the majority of the league, and they're supposed to be because they are -- USA won I don't know how many gold medals in a row and then Spain won it last year. But I think there are some European players and there will be some European players contributing to win and giving that edge to the good teams to win championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,No. I need to go home. Laughter.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we succeed in our jobs, and we won the whole thing. It's an amazing feeling. But like I said before, it's not everything in the world. I think. Okay, I won it. Okay, not I, we won it. But I think it's not the most important thing in the world still. There is a bunch of things that I like, that I like to do. Probably that's a normal thing. Nobody likes his job, or maybe they do. They're lying. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But it's a good feeling when you know that you did something that nobody believes, and it's just us, it's just the organization, Denver Nuggets believing in us, every player believing in each other, and I think that's the most important thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, not just daughter, my wife who was with me since day one, even in Belgrade, my brother that I live with my brother. Actually, we all lived together in one moment, so it was a circus. But they are somebodies that are in my life. It means a lot, and without them I'm not going to be here 100 percent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't slam the chair, but I like how you make it bigger. Yes, I yell at them because we were just shooting threes, and I think it was like 4-on-3, we could just get an easy layup or score the ball. In that situation, it means a lot -- like to score a ball. Especially it's a low-scoring game, we didn't make shots, they didn't make shots. It was 90-something, 80-something game. I think easy points are something that kills it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"In that situation, emotions, yes, I yell at them, but I think they're used to it. Sometimes I yell at them, sometimes I cheer them but that's part of the family, part of the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't remember, but -- yes, I think Sparky got me. But it's a great emotions. Everything is in a good positive way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Got to be. Congratulations. I'm going to see if he texted me, no? I don't know. Oh, my phone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,A lot. A lot. I'm not going to -- I'm going to turn off the phone.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sport is something that always in Serbia was something that put in front of us everybody, even like 10, 20 years ago, whatever, but now when we have Djokovic who won, probably the best ever. For us he's the best ever of course, and now we have our NBA championship, and I think it's a really good moment to be a Serbian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's amazing. It's been so long for the Nuggets organization to be in this position, and we knew we wanted to just come out and be the first team to ever do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I'm excited to even just be a part of the history that we made tonight.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,What's next? Me and Bruce is going to shoot 100 jumpers in the summertime and we're going to play golf the whole summer. That's what's next for me and Bruce.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, everybody wants to run it back after you win. But that's up to the organization is to bring back the players or whatever it is. But this team is special. I knew it from training camp, and just been telling them all the way through training camp and the whole season, we can do this. Just believe in ourselves, in each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"We feel amazing, obviously. Since day one in training camp in San Diego, we knew we could do this. We worked for this. Was it 17 of us, 15 of us? Worked extremely hard. Every practice, every game, we stayed locked in. We stayed together. So I'm just extremely happy for the group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"To always be ready. He's a guy that sees the floor no matter where he's at, so you can be open at any time. Just be ready to score and be ready to shoot at any time because he'll pass you the ball. Essentially, he's a point center, which is ridiculous. We haven't seen that before. We've seen a point power forward. Never seen a point center before. So he's the first."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"I'll take a little time off. I'm going to probably be with Doug, learn how to ride a horse, drink a lot of Jameson and Gingers, play a lot of golf and then be with my dog. Other than that, be with my boys back at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,He's going to get paid is what he's going to do. He's going to get paid to start playing. My man fitting to get a bag.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"I told myself if and when we win, I'm going to do exactly what we and I did to get to this point. I'm going to celebrate, but I'm going to continue to work smarter, harder and more efficient."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,That's a professional answer right there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,That was tough with a lot of champagne.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"He's been amazing for me. Just confidence. As you've seen, we've got Nikola, Jamal, MPJ and Aaron on the floor, and last game he's putting the ball in my hands and letting me make a play. So that says a lot. He has the confidence in his players. If he needs to get on you, he'll get on you. But he means well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, he's just a competitor. He's so damn competitive. He wants it just as much as we want it, if not more. It doesn't matter if we're up 20 or down 20, he's on us. He just stays competitive, and you've got to respect that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"We saw it. We saw it. When I first got traded, we saw it. We felt like we had all the pieces in order, put together. Then, yeah, of course injuries. But then we got Brucey B and we got KCP, and with the addition of them, it was wraps."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"No, it didn't sink in. I got the bucket because AG, he had two on him and they forgot about me. So kudos to AG. This is why me and KCP came here this offseason. This is what we wanted to do. This is what we envisioned. This is just a great ending."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Man, it's straight like joy, emotion, validation, just excitement. I heard Brucey B was talking earlier about how he was putting in -- he was waking up at like 600 a.m. or 400 a.m. and doing two-a-days and grinding. That's what we have on this team we have grinders."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Just for two-a-days, three-a-days, four-a-days, and for it to all pay off and all come down and be with the team and be with guys we love, it was emotional, honestly. It's crazy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,For sure smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Well, we're going to enjoy tonight, of course. This is a night to be celebrated --"
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,A few weeks. Not just tonight. We're going to enjoy this for a few weeks.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"A few weeks to be celebrated. But I believe that it can be replicated. The guys on this team are very humble. The humility is there, the IQ is there and these guys are workers. Championship or not, we don't let it change our character."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, it was a whirlwind because going into this season, we expected -- obviously we didn't get off to a great start in the beginning of the season, and then go through adversity, guys being out, playing with eight guys, still trying to find a way, missing shots, everybody counting us out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"You lose the first Play-In game, then win the second one and you go on an unbelievable run to the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"The only thing I can say is, man, they need to put more respect on undrafted players. They are still basketball players at the end of the day, and obviously you've seen, they can take you there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So for me, it was a joy to get this far and have these type of guys, undrafted, fighting to make a name for themselves. And they fought to the Finals. Came up short, but I don't care what anybody says. You can never count these guys out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"No, he just makes the right play every possession. I feel like that's the biggest thing about the player that he is. He's going to try to make the right play every possession, no matter if he's scoring the ball or passing it, getting a high-key assist. It doesn't matter. I feel like that's what makes him dynamic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"It definitely wasn't the last two minutes. That's what everybody usually tries to take away from the game, the last two minutes, what we did wrong or what happened. I think through the duration of the game, they got a lot of relief points, offensive rebounds, run-outs in transition. You know, us on missed communications and so forth. So I wouldn't say it was just the last two minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MAX STRUS,"Hard to put into words right now. Still trying to get over this. We didn't want to be done. I think the biggest part about that was the fun we had together, this group, after we picked up Kevin Love and Cody Zeller. It was just unique how we all came together and enjoyed this run together and just had fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MAX STRUS,"I didn't want it to end tonight. Wanted to keep going. Through all the adversity we had all season, it's hard to put into words how grateful we are for the year and grateful to be in the position we had."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MAX STRUS,"But we came up short. It's going to be a lesson that we've all learned, and we'll be better for our careers going forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"You take the experience of this season and if you can just bottle that up, and everybody just have their own portion or rewritten story of it. The No. 1 thing I think would be will."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So looking forward, I think this is one of my favorite teams I've ever been a part of because we willed our way through ups and downs. We willed our way through the things that people said we couldn't do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So for me, the future, I just take these lessons and I apply them to the next season. Whenever we go through adversity, I'm always going to look back and be like, we've been through adversity before. You know, having the 8 seed in the Finals isn't normal. It isn't easy. People think it depends on what seeding you are is how good you're going to be. To me, that's bull----, and obviously this season showed different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So just looking forward, I'm always going to believe that we've got a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"The mood has been the same. We know what we're capable of. We're optimistic, and we're looking forward to Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, just about at this point we've almost seen everything under the sun. We're just looking forward to it. We've been keeping things pretty in house, and we're a pretty confident group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"I think they play a different brand of basketball than most of the league. I think the way they cut, the way Joker is able to facilitate and still be aggressive to score, and obviously the challenge of Jamal Murray."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"They have a lot of different weapons. They play a little different style, and it's been effective for them throughout."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,Just continue to believe in what we are capable of and what we've been doing all year. Come into Game 5 with the right mentality and sense of urgency.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"One play at a time. That's how. That's high praise from a legendary coach, so I'm grateful to hear that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"It's just one game. Whether it's a good game or a career high or career low, it's still just one game, and everything resets when that final buzzer rings."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,I'm sure. I'm sure that's a weight off his shoulders to have a healthy baby born and to have a healthy mom there taking care of the baby.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,We're happy for him and we're happy to welcome a new member to his family.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"I think every team we've played this playoff run we've been called undersized, so I don't think we're going to use that as an excuse now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Omer is the man. Unfortunately he was hurt all year, which was unfortunate for him and for us. He could have helped all year. Just a big man, big presence, super skilled. We would have loved to have him. Just unfortunate timing for him this season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Same as every game. Try to maintain the same process of getting ready, figure out adjustments, figure out ways we can be better and just get ready for the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Just play good defense. It is what it is at this point. We've got another elimination game, which we're used to by this point, and we're looking forward to it. Looking forward to getting started tomorrow night, and can't wait."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"No, we're the same. We've still got a chance to play. There's 28 teams that are sitting on their couch watching us. We're all competitors. We want to be here. We want to play. We want to be here and compete in these moments and compete at the highest level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Sure. There's a lot of things that we could do better, multiple things offensively and defensively that we need to do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Kevin's voice is always heard in our locker room, a champion, vet. He's been through it. Kyle has been in the 3-1 game, too. They've both had stories that they've shared with us and ways to motivate and help us and understand the situation. We're always listening to guys like that. He's huge for our locker room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"For sure. For sure. This whole season has been dedicated to him. To get here for the Finals and to try to win a championship for him is always on our minds. We still have that opportunity, and we're going to try to take advantage of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'm not that irascible, am I? Laughter. Ramona and I are in a great place. I was not talking about Ramona. Sometimes people read me wrong."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So we're talking about Herro. No new update. He's doing another contact workout today. I probably won't have anything for you tomorrow morning -- oh, we don't have a shootaround."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, somebody else draw that next straw."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we were actually just reading that. He was talking about the Mamba Mentality. What a spectacular win and career. He's talked about that mental side of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have a very mentally tough team. We do believe in that. We have a big goal and, from our standpoint, nothing has changed. It is extremely challenging to accomplish that ultimate title. We have a very stubborn and defiant group, and I think it's good to have a little bit of defiance from time to time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we need to do a better job, just overall, with our offense, some of the details and how we can shift their defense. They definitely made an adjustment to try to stay at home on three-point shooters. It's not the first time we have faced that. I think that's a great compliment to them and how important they are to our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We just have to do it better. There's certain things that I thought we did great in Game 3, and then there's different things we did great in Game 4. We just need to put it all together. It might not be perfect, but put more things together that are in our strength zones, even against what they are trying to get accomplished."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,That's what the deal is. They are trying to take away certain things. We are trying to get to certain things. How can you get to it and how can you get it on your terms.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Look at me. I look ridiculous. I'm not out there playing. He's not playing against me laughter. That's absurd. No.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's the Miami Heat toughness that we're talking about laughter. He should have been allowed to take the first swing. Yeah. We won't reveal who that is, but yeah, he can take a punch and get back up. He's not going to miss any time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have just -- I've used this term before, savage competitors. They love the ultimate challenges and the ultimate competition. Some of the fiercest battles were back in training camp when we were competing and splitting up teams. We could barely get through those full-contract practices without everybody screaming at each other, yelling at the coaches that are officiating, arguing about the scores. It's that level of intensity when they are playing and competing for a score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Love playing in these kind of environments where the crowd is going to be great tomorrow. Everybody is counting us out. We're used to that. But ultimately it has to be decided between those four lines. The crowd is not going to decide it. The narratives are not going to decide it. Whatever the analytics are about 3-1, that ain't going to decide it. It's going to be decided between those four lines, whose game can get to whose game and ultimately win at the end. That's what our guys love."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,So we're looking forward to it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"By the time we got on the flight, everybody was great. We get to compete in this kind of game tomorrow night. Everybody is looking forward to that. If you're a real competitor, you want this. You want the feeling that you have today, tomorrow, leading up to the game, how you feel in your heart and your stomach when that ball gets tipped up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we've had setbacks. That's part of the playoffs. Tough losses. Our group has shown a resilience to bounce back and show that defiance time and time again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, it seems like they've prioritized that, just maybe helping a little bit less on drives and staying home a little bit more. So it's an adjustment. It's something that we're used to and we feel like we can still generate good three-point looks. It's just going to be a matter of running good, crisp offense with pace, full court and half court, and then just playing to our strengths."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Definitely give them some credit in terms of just staying home just a little bit more. But like I said, we feel like we can still generate good looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I mean, it wasn't cool that he was killing us and we were losing. That wasn't cool. But I have a lot of respect for Bruce and his journey and the path that he's taken."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Like he probably mentioned, we go back, same area, playing with, against each other, high school, and then just following his career all the way through."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It's been really cool to see him really kind of reinvent himself and constantly find ways. He's just a good basketball player. He can do it in different ways. Comes in as a point guard and is a really good point guard for Detroit and then finds a new role in Brooklyn and bounces around, and now he's obviously a big part of the Western Conference champions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think we have really solid leadership in place, whether it be coaching staff, whether it be guys that are battle tested in that sense. I think we have a collective trust and belief in each other that regardless of the circumstances, we have enough to get it done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think we also just don't get too far ahead of ourselves. We take it step by step. Like today, it's just all about maximizing this prep and this practice. Tomorrow in the morning, it'll be the same. Then when the ball gets rolled out tomorrow night, it's just about finding a way to get one game, and we'll go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,Just kind of having that resolve and experience I think makes a big difference.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think this team is different than the other teams we've faced. They're relentless. They're going to come in full force. We ended up actually blowing Phoenix out in Phoenix, but we know tomorrow is not going to be like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But one thing about this team is we just have a game-by-game mentality, so we're viewing it as we're down 3-1, we're not up 3-1 right now. We've got to win tomorrow. That's our mindset, and that's pretty much how we've done all Playoffs and these elimination games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Well, we rely on our team. We rely on our brothers. We understand what the task is at hand and what we're trying to accomplish and the opportunity that we have in front of us, and to accomplish that you need a level of focus."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"While the rest of the city is frenetic and ecstatic and buzzing, we've got to stay calm and we've got to stay level headed and focused to achieve what we've set out to achieve since training camp."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I mean, this is an amazing experience, an amazing opportunity for P-Wat. Would he like to be playing? I'm sure he would. But he's behind some really, really, really great players, and he's getting to observe and getting to study and all the energy that he's not using on the court he gets to store up and use it for when he does get on the court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,P-Wat has a great feel for the game and a chance to be a really great player for this team and to help this team along the way. I'm excited for P-Wat and the experience that he has gathered thus far.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"That's a Point God right there, 12 assists, no turnovers, not forcing, hitting big shots, timely shots, and really just being a floor general out there, being steady, rock solid, even when they're trapping, giving him different looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"He's making the right play, and that's what we need from him night in and night out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We've only got hopefully one game left, so hopefully I can catch a rhythm this game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But I did what I could last game. I think I played with good effort. I think I tried to get downhill, get to the rim, be active cutting. My teammates found me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Getting to the line is big for me, so when my shot is not falling, even though that's my bread and butter, is my jumper, but there's other ways impact the game. So, I just got to keep looking to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I'm going to let a few fly tomorrow. Hopefully they go in, but if not, I'm going to stay active defensively, on the boards, cutting to the rim, all those things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I mean, we've been doing a good job on the glass. I think defensively it helps, as well. Then we're able to post on the block, just using our size and using our advantages physically."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"But yeah, we've got to go through Joker, continue to go through Joker, give him the spacing that he needs, and then eat off him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I mean, it's quarter by quarter for sure. I think there's a sweet spot in the emotion because we know we're coming into tomorrow excited, we want to win in front of our home crowd, finish it here, but we can't come in too high because we know they're coming in desperate."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We've just got to stay even keel, which I think our team does a good job of doing. Even if the first few minutes don't go our way, we tend to steady out over the course of a game and find our groove."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"It's going to be ups and downs tomorrow. We know it's going to be a crazy game. They're going to come out firing on all cylinders, but if we just stay together and keep our head down, there's going to be stretches during the game where we're just flowing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"That's how it's been all series. We go on big runs, we have been up big, even the game we lost. They didn't all start good. We just got to stay steady out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I mean, it's really important. We need to play a sound, solid defensive game tomorrow to come out of here with a win. It needs to be disciplined, not break down, and not let some of the other guys get going. It's important. It's crucial."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think one thing that I really respect about Coach Malone is just that he's consistent in how he is. Like he hasn't coached us any different, tried to motivate us any different than he has all season. Coach Malone is very competitive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Even game 82, I think we played against Utah, I'm pretty sure, but he was just as -- I think we lost that game. He was just as upset about losing that game as he would a game right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So he's very consistent in his approach and the way he coaches us individually and as a team. Like I can respect that, and I think that's one thing that I see from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I think Mike said it best. He's competitive. He's a straight competitor. It doesn't matter if we're up 20 or down 20. He's going to be on us either way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I know they want it bad, but we want it bad, too. I don't think anybody wants it badder than we want it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think DA personally, I think he's an offensive wizard in my opinion just because he's shown us on film -- like showing us what's going to happen next game, and when we go and execute what he's showing us, it works out for us every time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We struggled with the Miami Heat's zone a couple games and he was showing us what to get into, what to do. Then Christian had that big game, all off cuts and just following what DA was saying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So I think offensively there's not much better that I've seen as far as offense, and that's why I think we have one of the best offenses historically. I think that's a big reason why."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We love him over here, and if he didn't leave to go get a head coaching job, that's good for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, they had MPJ, Mal, Jok, Paul Millsap. We had dogs on this team already. It was kind of just like I felt like the missing piece a little bit. When I got traded here, I feel like we were on our way to a championship that year, and then a couple injuries happened and we don't get it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"But now I feel like we're here, and the team is put together, the pieces all fit, and now you can see the puzzle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think as a young basketball player, this is what you -- this is like the pinnacle of what you want to get to. I think any championship, whether it's high school, college, they all mean a lot, but to win a championship against the best players in the world, we've already played against some of the best players in the world in this playoff run on our way to be here, so to get this trophy, it's like a big thing you check off the list."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,Like this is probably the biggest thing you could check off the list as a basketball player. I think we all kind of feel that way.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Well, just not breaking down on defense. I think in the one game where they shot a lot of threes and made a lot of threes, we had far too many breakdowns. I think if we execute the defensive game plan, we'll be fine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"For me, appreciate Gallo. For me, the first person that reached out was Klay, in the X-ray room. That meant a lot to me. That helped me a lot. Understand that from the get-go, it's going to be a long journey. Just seeing his face in that moment, and you could tell he was still recovering from his injury and he was still hurt mentally. It just helped me a lot get through, knowing I'm going to be in a dark time. It's not going to be a cakewalk."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"Basically, a lot of guys did. It's hard for me to single out a few. But Gallo was one, all my old teammates."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'm just happy to be in this position, knowing that everything I did to rehab was solid."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it's the realization, I think is one of the biggest things. Everybody talks about, don't want to miss an opportunity, or when you miss an opportunity, you're like, damn, that was a good opportunity for me to have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just think, thinking about all the things I've done growing up, all the things I wanted to do growing up, being here is one of them. So I don't want to miss the opportunity. So like I said, knowing is not enough. It's good to know it and realize it, but you have to go out there and motivate yourself to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"For me, just keeping that mindset. All martial arts, not just basketball, all martial arts stuff helped me with life and navigate that way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's long before we made it here that I thought this was going to happen. I had a belief of being in the playoffs before, having the experience, seeing the team and the chemistry grow, having the same core my whole career, that's when I saw it. That's when I believed it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"To be here just kind of rounds it out and shows that when we are given the right circumstances and everybody healthy, God willing, we can do it. I think when we're playing our best basketball, we are a very hard team to stop. I just see us playing like that for the majority of the time. Sticking together, even when we go through rough stretches, we're still in a good place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,I've personally had that belief for a very long time. No new confidence for me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, their shooters are moving on every drive. Duncan is flying off both ways off Bam. Strus is not shooting well, but he's getting some good looks. So we can't keep giving these shooters good looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"We know they are going to make shots, but as long as we keep our discipline and don't give them the open stuff, I think we are in a good spot. We gave them a couple easy layups, easy dunks last game. We take those away, we take away a lot of life they have and kind of just shut down their offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,We're staying home with shooters and allowing AG to play one-on-one with Jimmy a lot. The same thing with Jok. It feels like we are planning to take away the three and they are still get something good looks.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"So I think we are just keeping our awareness up on drives and those hesitation situations, offensive rebounds, finding the shooters, getting back in transition. Just taking the easy ones away and knowing that if they are going to hit shots, it's going to be over a contested hand."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. Maybe one day in practice laughter, but no."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's very smart with his tactics. The way they front him or deny him. We don't really fight the pressure we both get. Just seeing him make quick decisions, if the pass is open, there's no hesitation. Even if he turns it over sometimes, he takes what the defense is giving him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"Jokic is holding the ball for half a second longer and figuring it ou. He's been doing that for so long at all levels. He won his first MVP and his numbers were better than the second MVP, and his numbers are better during now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, yeah, I think there's more to come, actually, from Jok. I think we haven't seen a side of Jok that we are going to see where he can be just pure dominance all the way, the whole game, even more than he has been."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. I'd just say patience is key. Nothing happens overnight. I think we have done a great job, not just as a team but as an organization, sticking together, keeping each other up, motivating each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"We have got Stan and Josh in the locker rooms, win or loss, which means a lot. Just seeing everybody's faces. I still get messages from Tim. I get messages from Monte. Everybody is part of the journey and understands what we are about. It's just nice to see us be a big family and understand what it takes to win. But yeah, it's been a journey, a lot of fun. We have got more work to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"You know, they do a great job of just sticking to the system, whatever it is they do, whether it's defensively, offensively. You can definitely tell and have the feel of how much chemistry they have playing with each other, how well-coached they are, and no matter how things are going throughout the game, they just stick to what they do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"That's a credit to them, just how well they continue to do it and how well mentally they are prepared no matter how the game is going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, it's definitely a different scout for sure. You get a different feel. For me personally I get a different feel out there, kind of being a little bit more of a priority, closing out, knowing where you're at, knowing when it's time to cut and those type of things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Like I said, that's part of them sticking to the system. They've done a great job of having a game plan and sticking to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"But that's what it's all about getting to this point of the season. They're going to make things difficult, and it's going to be our job to do the same on the other end. We've got to continue to find ways to find cracks whenever we can, and I think we do a great job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,We'll have a great prep today and find better ways to be more effective on both ends.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, you've got to find that balance between being aggressive but not forcing anything, as well. Like we were just talking about, I've kind of been in that role where you kind of take what is given, and they've done a great job of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"The opportunities I've had have been a lot lower because of how they defend and what their system looks like. It might be a series in a game where I have to be more assertive and be more creative and find ways to get my attempts up because I think, like you said, last series my attempts were pretty high, probably the highest they've ever been in my career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"I think whenever I get -- have my attempts that high, I typically can be a pretty effective and efficient."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,I've definitely got to be more assertive but also within the offense. I'm a role guy. I've got to take what's given. But for sure I definitely need to find ways to be more assertive in that aspect for sure.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I think that, like you said, naturally everybody looks to the stars to get us past that game and get us to the next one, but we're a group of guys who depend and lean on each other, and that's what makes our team so great and our stars so great, that they're so unselfish."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"The trust factor they have in the other guys like us on the team, it pumps confidence into us, and they understand how important and key of a piece that we can be to get us to the next game, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"I think it's a collective thing to where we all understand we all need to elevate our games, and while also, like you said, the stars being the stars, and the role players gotta be stars in their roles."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I definitely get fuel while being disrespected. I felt like if someone doesn't believe I can do something, I typically find the best way possible to do it. That definitely gets my juices flying, like you said, especially airballing like 3 feet from the basket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"I'm not Steph or nothing like that, but I don't think I'm airballing three feet from the rim. Yeah, we've got to find ways to continue to be aggressive and have those internal battles all the time to keep things going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, we're definitely getting great looks. They're doing a great job of taking some things away from us. But I think we'll have adjustments to find ways to get our guys going. That's their job, is to take away certain things, big muscle things for us. That's been in their favor. We've got to take advantage of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CALEB MARTIN,"We're a great enough offensive team to where if you take something away, something has gotta give. We'll definitely find ways to be more impactful on that end for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, first off, it's real. That's been part of his upbringing through his father, Roger. Martial arts, the meditation, the visualization. That's allowed Jamal to get to this stage and perform at the level he's performing at. It's allowed him to recover from an injury that had him miss the last two postseasons."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The most important aspect of all of that for me is it's genuine, it's real. Jamal believes in it and he practices it. That allows him to go out and use it to help his game, help his body and help his mind. Whatever is going to put him in the right frame of mind, I'm all for because we all see what he's doing out there on the biggest stage of the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've long said that Jamal is not just a scorer. That's been my challenge to him. That should be an affront to him, that people just look at him as a scorer, because ever since he became a starting point guard, he is charged with the responsibility of running this team, making every one of his teammates better, on top of being an aggressive scorer looking for his shot, on top of being a rebounder at his size and physicality, as well as being an engaged defender."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The challenge is always for you to be an All-Star and All-NBA player, and for you to be the guy that is, along with Nikola, putting this team on your back, it requires commitment and effort all across the board."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know that he's capable of making his teammates better. He's shown that in the past. I think it's just constantly striving to become the best version of yourself. Jamal is really committed to trying to be the best version. That's allowing him to be a historical player and allowing him to have that in his first four Finals games, whatever it is, is just incredible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,Took off when I left. Thanks for reminding me laughter.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I have not spoken to Steve about those similarities. Obviously, when I was there, I worked for Mark Jackson and worked for, obviously, Bob Myers, was with Larry Riley at that time. But I think that's one of the real cool things about how we have gotten here. Everybody, every individual, more importantly, every team collectively has to pick a path and stay true to it. I feel really fortunate that our journey has been one of patience, one of drafting really well and developing those players, and then adding the right pieces around them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, you add an Aaron Gordon, a KCP, a Bruce Brown, whatever it may be. Everybody does it differently. Some teams want to mortgage their future and go get the surefire player, the All-Star. For us, there's never been a rushed mentality. That starts with the ownership. The Kroenke family has been phenomenal since day one allowing this thing to play itself out and not overreacting to other bumps in the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think there are other teams in this league that are looking at how we have done it, smaller-market teams, how we've done it. I think more teams will try to kind of make this a blueprint."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, it's not for everybody. This was the best course for us, and it's allowed us to get here. But once again, we still have a lot of things that we need to accomplish in order for us to become world champions. We know tomorrow night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I do. But the one word that I think isn't in your Finnish identity maybe that we really, really put a huge level of importance on is communication. If you just look at our series, we lost Game 2 at home and we gave up 17 threes that night. I felt our level of communication was not anywhere where it needed to be. You think about Game 1, they made 13. I think Game 3 they made 11 and Game 4 they made eight threes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yes, you have to trust. That's a big part of our culture. Being courageous is always something that's going to put yourself in a position to be aggressive. You have to have an aggressive mindset to be an effective defensive team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"But if you don't have communication and discipline to go along with that, I think you're going to be missing some really key components. That's allowed us -- I mean, I think in the three wins that we've had against Miami, they are averaging 94 points, and their field goal percentage and three-point percentage are really, really low."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,It's going to have to be even better tomorrow evening.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I would say regarding the team response, I thought it was outstanding. We went down to Miami. Won two games on the road. We did it by playing this great defense. So our guys really bought in and committed to not only playing harder for longer, but also just being a lot more connected and talking our defense and being disciplined. It was two great examples in Game 3 and 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"My biggest concern going into any close-out game is human nature and fighting against that. You're up 3-1. Most teams, when you're up 3-1, they come up for air. They relax and they just kind of take it for granted that, oh, we're going to win this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The neat thing for us is that going back to the bubble, we've been down 3-1. We've come back and won. We know anything is possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's why my message to our team before we came down to the media and open practice was our approach has to be we are down 3-1. They are desperate we have to be more desperate. They are hungry we have to be hungrier. There is no celebrating after Game 4. We have another game that we have to win, and the close-out game is always the hardest game ever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,So I'm looking forward to seeing our approach. We had it in Game 6 against Phoenix and Game 5 against Minnesota and Game 4 against the Lakers. My hope is tomorrow night in front of this incredible crowd and incredible environment that the players understand the opportunity in front of them and take full advantage of them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Stay in the moment and once that jump ball goes up tomorrow night, our players, every possession, every moment of that game can't be, ""We have to win this game."" We have to stay true to ourselves, trust what's gotten us to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"The message after Game 4 in Miami was, everybody is yelling, ""Just one more win."" Hey, let's just win the first quarter tomorrow night. Take it in small bites. Take it in small bites. And if you do that possession by possession, quarter by quarter, hopefully when 48 minutes are over, you've done what you needed to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"But this team has been through a lot. The last two years, no Jamal Murray last season, no Michael Porter. To get back healthy and add some key pieces, this is a team that has been tested before and I think is really built for this moment. Our guys are excited for that opportunity tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think eight years with Nikola, and that was -- in our culture of being a work team, a selfless team and a trust team, that was day one when I got here. And then slowly but surely, culture is not a thing that you achieve and you cross it off your list. Culture is a thing that you have to work on each and every day, or if not, that culture is going to go away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"It just so happens that the two-time MVP and a great player in Nikola kind of embodies everything. To your point, when you have a guy that has had the success that Nikola has had, being your hardest worker and being as selfless as he is and trusting as much as he does, well, that allows everybody else to kind of fall in line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,So it's a real luxury as a head coach to have a player that kind of embodies everything that we are trying to do on a daily basis.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"There was no stress level. In that series against Phoenix, we won two games at home. They won two games at home. We realized that we were playing against a team that most people had picked to come out of the Western Conference. Understandably so, with the talent level that they had. So I can't say that they were stressed coming home to Game 5. We knew we had a terrific home-court advantage and our fans would show up and we'd play a lot better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think now when you go back to Phoenix and Game 6 and a chance to close it out, I didn't expect to be up 30 at halftime. But it just kind of speaks to our guys understanding that in the close-out game, we did not rely upon having Game 7 in our pocket to go home and play in front of our fans. We don't rely upon having three games to close out Miami. When you start relying upon things like that, you get yourself into trouble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that's why I say, tomorrow's game, we're down 3-1. This is a must-win for us, and hopefully, if that's the mentality our guys can go out there and play with, we'll put ourselves in a great position."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, honestly, even if we didn't have that team come back from down 3-0, I think we still believe. The one thing about it I'm sure you see the spirit around our guys, we believe in ourselves. We believe in what we can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, we know we're down. Unfortunately, we're down 3-1. But all we've got to do is take it one possession at a time, one minute at a time, one second at a time, and just continue to do what we do, believe in that game plan, understand what the game plan is, and just be positive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"At the end of the day, we've got a chance to go out there and play basketball. You've still got to go out there and put the ball in the hole and go out there and have fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think as a group, I think we've found ways that we've gotten great looks. I think we've found a little bit of a rhythm offensively. We haven't made all the shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think the turnovers hurt us last game a lot. I think getting shots on goal is always big for us as a group, and that's been throughout the whole year for our team is getting shots on goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we've just got to stay confident, and I think we are very confident in what we do and how we've gotten here and are each other's -- you know, all our teammates."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I think we know what we can do offensively. We just haven't done it. We feel like we know we can do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Kind of the same thing, right? You've got to always adapt, always adjust. It's always about understanding what's going on in the world. But at the same time, staying true to yourself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"We always say you stay true to yourself, how you write your articles, how you write your papers or whatever you write, how I play, how I work on my game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I know it's a funny thing to say I'm 37 years old and 17 years and the guys joke with me and they be like, oh, you listen to Gladys Knight, and stuff like that. They don't know who Gladys Knight is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"But they keep me young. I know that my mind, I can pass along the knowledge to them as much as I can. Udonis is up there with me, Kevin is up there with me. These guys keep me young, and the staying power is just believing in what you do and continuing to work, never being satisfied with, oh, yeah, I had a great career, da, da, da, but I still feel like I can do more, I can give more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I'm playing in my second NBA Finals, a chance to win another ring. That just motivates me more. That motivates me more, and it continues to keep me young and it continues to have me -- like, yo, I need to do something to get better. I need to do this, I need to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Also, yeah, I want to continue to help our league. Our league is important. We create generational wealth for our families, all the guys that come through this league. We have an opportunity to make a lot of money and provide for our families and do a game that we love, give back to our communities."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"For me, I just like to continue to pass along the information, but I'm still motivated to compete at the highest level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I'm not going to give Denver no type of tips, but I think from that 2019 thing, I think my team was just completely focused on the task at hand. I mean, it's different. We were on the road, so we knew what it was. We understood the situation. We understood the type of firepower those guys had. We knew exactly, hey, this could be a seven-game series, but we've got to stay focused on the task at hand."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"For us, going into tomorrow, we know the task at hand and we know what we can do and we know what we're capable of, so we've got to stay focused on that and being with each other no matter what."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, we would love to have that. We would love to have one of those games where they both do 50 points and we climb on their back. We understand it's all about them. We got to support them. At the end of the day, we got to give them as much help as we possibly can. Get them good looks. Get them the ball in situations that they can be successful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"The one thing about those two guys, they're going to be ready to play tomorrow. They're going to be ready to go tomorrow. For us, we've got to find a way to make sure we help them be successful. That's what it's about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"We can help them, they can get 50 and all that stuff, but we've still got to help them get 50 and be in the right spots and get them the ball in a successful place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"It's enjoyable, period. Honestly, yeah, like after games you're a little bit more sore or this or that, but the grind is so enjoyable. Like I said, I've got a great locker room. We've got a great locker room, great group of guys, great coaching staff, a group of guys that like being around each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"That's part of it. You build a bond of brotherhood for each other. You build a bond that is kind of unbreakable. You go back and say, oh, man, in 2000 whatever, we got this, and you've got a group of guys that have earned the opportunity to be here and have fought and clawed to have the opportunity to be here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"That's why the grind is so enjoyable for me is because I didn't have the best year health-wise and numbers-wise, but we're here with the opportunity to play basketball and I'm here with the opportunity to see these guys be successful and make shots and be on the biggest stage and help them want to get here again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"The grind is very much enjoyable. It's a little bit different some days, but it's always love."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Naturally when your back is up against the wall you start to look for answers, solutions. But we're a team that as you know has been super resilient. We understand that it's every possession, it's one game. I know that's something that is cliche and everybody says but again, we feel like if we come out, have a good start tomorrow, play extremely hard and give ourselves a chance and take it back to Miami, that is right where we want to be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"But again, tomorrow is one of those things where a close-out game is the hardest game of the series, always. Game 5 is always, always a tough game in the series if you can push it there. We just have to come out to our game, stick to our schemes both offensively and defensively. There are some things that have been glaring for us. We'll go out there and get the job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Since I've been here, been very vocal with the team, UD as well, having that championship pedigree and having been there before. But certainly Kyle having been up 3-1 and us being down 3-1 with the Cavs in 2016, we definitely have different viewpoints and things to give vocally to the team. So weve just been consistently in the guys ears to not let up and stay in the saddle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"She might have. She might have. Just, definitely need to get some rest now and get some sleep. Everybody is happy and healthy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Was able to make it in for our film session. Got a little bit of sleep, so today will be good to get up and down, get acclimated here and get some treatments, get some rest and be ready to roll."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"It's certainly been special. We don't feel like we have ever been a normal eight seed, getting in the second Play-In game and beating Chicago and just letting the chips fall. We've been a very resilient team, a team that is consistently giving effort, consistently giving endless support to each other. Our locker room has been amazing. Coaching staff has been amazing. Organization has been incredibly supportive. So any time you have that, you give yourself a chance to do some special things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KEVIN LOVE,"Denver uses a great word about, I think they use it in terms of their offense but we certainly have applied it to who we are as a group and that's just be fluid, I love that word and not only how we play on offense but away from the court or going through this, we are very intentional and we are getting down to business, and we know the job at hand and the task at hand but at the same time we are fluid, we are loose, and you know, that is going to help us play in a moment like this when the lights are the brightest, to just play free and play that fluid style of basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I always say, he came to visit me a couple times back home in Serbia and he came to visit me even when I play with the national team in Lithuania -- was it Lithuania? Yeah, so he came around a couple times. My whole family just getting to know him. We got together. We did a couple fun things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"For the relationship, for the whole eight years, we have grown so much, not just on the court. He's a good guy. He always likes to visit me and we always appreciate him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,I really don't know. Probably it's good. I think it's good when you have a good relationship with your coach laughter. So I think it was good.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it means a lot, especially in the Playoffs. You can see the plays before. You can talk to it and know what's coming. Even in the first game, from the first game, you can see how we are as a team better in communication and maybe reading the plays and knowing when to help and when not to help."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we are growing even now in the Finals. Every game, we are better and better. I think that's probably the first and most important thing in defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"We are going to approach it as a must-win game. I know it's a big opportunity, and I think everybody knows. By reflection of the practice today, how everybody was locked in, I think we are going to be ready for tomorrow. Vets are there to do their job and keep us not relaxed, keep us tight. They are doing a really good job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think vets in this league are really important for our team, for whatever team. You need to have good vets."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I played with Monte a long time. Then when Jamal got hurt, we had really good connection on the court, I was always good with him on the court. Even my family, he was always around. He's a guy who I really like as a friend. Really funny guy. You can talk to him about anything. I like Monte."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Wilson Chandler texted me. I saw Mike Miller in Miami. Jameer Nelson texted me a couple -- I think when we get in the Finals. A bunch of guys, but those are the guys I can remember. All my Serbian comrades -- I'm going to say like that -- they all reach out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I love it. He's a great guy and I really appreciate him. He's here for a long, long time. I'm going to say ten years from a G League coach to a head coach in the NBA. It's a lot of respect for him and for his work. I think he deserves it. He's been seeing a lot. He's been through a lot. I think he deserves everything. I think he's going to do a great, great job there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, he is the second Serbian coach, being as NBA head coach. Igor Kokoskov first, he is second. The NBA is growing and people in the front office, I'm trying to see, maybe some other guys are willing to step up, and they are going to do a good job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, there is always Felipe who has been with me since day one. Jason Miller, a trainer, who was literally with me through everything, every injury, every pain. Sparky, who is working with me, came to Serbia a bunch of times. Sparky is always in the background."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,I'm just happy that I have the same guys around me the whole time. I'm going to do my best to keep them as much as possible around me because I like to stick with my people who have been with me from the beginning.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,NIKOLA JOKIC,I think it's not going to be emotional. It's going to be a job that we need to do to be done. I think we are ready. I think we are going to be locked in and ready to go. It's just going to be a game that we need to win.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, my role just overall is just always to be ready, and just when my number is called throughout this series, so I'm just going to continue to stay ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Obviously minutes have decreased, which it is what it is. I'm just trying to do what's best for the team and hopefully we can win, so I'm just ready when my number is called."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, they're big vets in this league. They've been through it all, won championships, so they know what it takes to get there and they know what it takes to come back from down 3-1."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"We're definitely going to look to them for a lot of advice because they've been in this situation before. It's big having them in the locker room. Them two OGs have won championships, Spo has won championships, so we have a lot of good leadership in the room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Just take it one game at a time. Just the main focus right now is getting back to the 305 and just go from there. It's not easy to be in the situation the Nuggets are in, up 3-1, because they're playing back at home for Game 5, so we're just going to take it one game at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"That's a great question. That this series is over. It's the first to four, not three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"He's definitely up there. His personality is humble, thoughtful. He's overall a great human being, very down to earth. So he's definitely up there in that top tier of favorite teammates for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"Oh, as a player, he's still up there in that top tier of teammates. I've played with a lot of legends in my time, and he's definitely up there skill-wise, IQ, ability with what he's able to do on the floor. He cracks the top 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, I already knew he could play defense. I think the media kind of just ran with this theory that he's not a good defensive player based on probably I guess he's not blocking shots I guess. I'm not even sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"But he has elite hands. You seen that last game, the way he's able to impact as far as his hands. His IQ of knowing where to be. Being in the right spaces. Obviously his rebounding is top tier. He's somebody who can rebound at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I think defensively he is definitely one of the best defenders out there. I credit that to his IQ but also his activeness with his hands.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"We've always been like that. We're out here just shooting. We go through what we need to go through upstairs. That's the mental preparation where we're locked in, we're focused."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"But up here we're just getting shots in, getting ready to do media. I think we understand what we have to do tomorrow in order to close this thing out, and I think everybody is focused."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"No. We understand it's one more win. Before anything else happens, we understand that 48 minutes is what it's going to take for us to win a championship. We're focused on that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"That just shows the type of person he is. I think just the big stage, people are starting to realize how he is. Now the media are coming from everywhere. Everybody is getting an up close and personal look at who he truly is and his personality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"I've always seen it. Now it's you guys' turn. Just the local media, I don't think anybody paid attention to it. Now, bigger scale, biggest stage, everybody is focusing on more than just the basketball aspect of what Nikola brings. I've always seen that side of him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,It's like four or five.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"Grace of God, man. I've just been coming in, doing my work, coming in every day, preparing myself to go to battle for my teammates. I've been blessed enough to have this opportunity to play 16 years, 15 years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I can't take no credit for that. I'm just out here doing my job on this side and trying to prepare myself each night to be there for my team.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"It's all about just being positive, I think. I think it's having that positive mindset every day, of the everyday grind of repetition and routine, having fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"I think that's what it's all about. I've had great teammates this year, alongside Ish, DJ. We have fun with the whole process of getting to this point, and I think it makes it joyful to wake up every day and do this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"It can get repetitive. It can get stressful because there are some bad days if you don't play well, you might not feel well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,"But if you don't have a positive outlook on the bigger picture, the everyday grind, like I said, I think that is what makes it worthwhile coming in here every day and just having fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. Like I've always been saying, just because of the crowd, we get to come into the arena, get to feel that energy from the crowd."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"My family will be here. My kids will be able to experience it, as well. I'm looking forward to just that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,Also just taking our time and trying to get this win.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I am. Still don't know the gender yet, but we'll find out, I guess, after tomorrow's game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah. We could be too excited or it could not go the way we want it. Tomorrow for us, it's just to be relaxed, composed, but take in the moment, enjoy it. Also just come out and play basketball how we've been playing this whole playoff and this series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Our mindset from the beginning of the Playoffs was to win a championship, and we know we're one game away. I'm always telling my teammates, don't get on the one-yard line and fumble the ball. We're here. Like I keep saying, just enjoy the moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We're going to come out and play as hard as we can, like we're down 3-1. That's the mindset we have. Continue to play great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It would be great. We could do something special for this organization and for this town and this city by winning their first championship. I'm excited for the game tomorrow, and I know my teammates are excited. We've just got to continue to get better and play as hard as we know we can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Second effort. We'll have to scramble sometimes throughout the game. But that second effort that we give to run them off that three-point line or get a contest or get a miss goes good in our favor, and that's what works for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,We're locked in. Our mindset is still we've got one game left. Job is not done. We're going to come in with a mindset to win tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But also got to have fun and enjoy this moment. This is the time where we can enjoy each other while we're on the basketball court, talk about anything besides basketball, but also being focused. We're out here just having fun with each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Just be aware, put body on body, load and just pay attention, honestly. But that's not the only time that there are cuts or offensive rebounds. We have to know where everybody is on the floor and do a better job of stopping individuals from getting cuts. It sounds really easy, but it's actually not because they have been doing it all year long. But gotta pay attention, be aware."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think so. I have to do a better job of getting guys open, whether it be off the screen or off my attacks, to make sure our shooters get the shots they normally get."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"All the film that we watch, we've got to find ways to do it. It's not easy. It's definitely not easy when you're in the Finals. They are paying attention to us as much as we are paying attention to them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"But we've got to be able to do it if we want to win. We do want to win, so we'll figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's at an all-time high because it always has been all year, it always will be, the belief that we have in one another. It stems from the amount of time that we spend with one another and how we actually enjoy being around one another. And we know what each other is capable of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"We didn't come this far to stop playing now, no matter what the odds are, the analytics. When we get out there, we've just got to compete. We've got to win one, and then we've got to win another one and then we've got to win another one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Same thing everybody has been saying Ain't nobody got to four yet. So keep playing. Stay in the fight. Knowing that if we get this one, we're on our way to do something special. So we've got to win three before they win one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Not long. There's nothing that you can do about it once you lose a game. You can get better and learn. You go into the next one and make sure you win, which is what we must do. The next three are legit must-wins, or we came this far for no reason. Let go of Game 4, 3, 2 and 1 and focus on the one that is next."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Absolutely nothing. I think I was a different player then. The team looked a lot different then. I don't even think about it. I think the group of guys that we have now, if that's what the game says you need to do, then maybe that's what happens."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I honestly don't think about 2020, 2021, none of that. We're in this time right now. So I have to be the best version of myself now, along with everybody else on this roster."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"Not at all. At the beginning of this year, we talked about winning a championship, competing to get to this point. So that's always the goal. It's always a goal with the Heat. It's about winning. It's not about individual anything. It's about holding that trophy collectively as a unit, to be the best team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's where we're at. All the odds, 8 seed, dadadadada, nah, none of that matters. It's just two really good basketball teams. One has to get one win, and one has to get three. Let's just hope that the other that has to get three, gets three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, we can't be worried about that. We know we're playing against a great team. Obviously, they've been doubted the whole year and they made it this far for a reason. We've got to be focused, bring energy and still know our personnel extremely well and just be focused on winning the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"I think about it when it's time. I don't think about it 247. When I'm home, just chill with my dog. My family is in town."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"But when it's time to lock in, I'll lock in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, just like Jok, he's making the game extremely easy for us. He's penetrating the defense. They're putting two on him and he's finding the open man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"If they're going to do that, everybody else on the floor has to do their part. So look for him to do that every game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, P-Wat is going to be extremely good. He's putting in the work. He's coming in early. He's putting weight on. He's working on his three-point shot. But when he gets his chance, he's going to thrive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I don't think it's just us scoring the ball. It's our defense. We've held them in the 90s the last few games and that's why we've won the game. So it's been the defensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"I mean, I guess. I was just trying to be aggressive no matter who was in front of me. Duncan just happened to be the player there. He tries hard on defense. No disrespect to him. We've definitely had our matchups when we were younger back in New England. But it was just whoever was in front of me, attack."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BRUCE BROWN,"I was thinking about what color shirts they were going to be wearing earlier today when I first walked in the arena. But it's going to be crazy. It's going to be loud. The fans are going to be here probably early. But I can't wait. I feed off their energy, so hopefully it's going to be a big night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, it's just another game. You have to approach it like we have approached all the games in the Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"That's the crazy part about the Finals. I think that there's so many games that everybody has the same routine, and you've just got to approach it like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Obviously it's a big opportunity and you can't miss out on opportunities like this, so to close it out at home in front of our fans would mean a lot to us, and we know it would mean a lot to them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,This is an opportunity. We're not going to let them down. We're going to come out here and play our game and enjoy the moment.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, it would mean the world to us and to them. I think that's one of the biggest parts about this, is we get to come home -- obviously we dropped Game 2, but we get to come home and play in front of our fans and have a chance to close it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"It's a big opportunity. Any closeout games are really big opportunities, and just to be able to do it in Denver would mean the world to us. We're going to come out with the same approach, the same hungry mentality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"That's the biggest part, just don't have a letdown game. Just come out and be humble, be hungry, and finish the job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Man, he's great. I think I said earlier, you couldn't have found a guy that fits more perfectly alongside the guys we have. He came in here, he sits down and plays defense every single night, all 82 regular-season games, and he's been one of the best defenders in the Playoffs. Really good dude."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Obviously loves Denver. Just a good, fun dude to be around, and he fits perfectly with our roster. We're grateful for him and what he's done for us, and he's taught me a lot along the process. We're grateful for BB, and we've got one more game hopefully where he plays really well like he did last game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think I don't have it too bad. I think a lot of people want to talk to Nikola and Jamal, obviously. I don't have it too bad, but you've got to be grateful for this, obviously. Just to be in this position and have people that want to talk to you and want to hear from you is obviously a blessing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I don't have it too bad, and I'm just fortunate to be here and grateful to be in this position."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, it's huge. Like I said, you get a chance to close out in front of fans that haven't had this moment before. We're going to go out there, we're going to approach it like every other game, but we're hungry."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You've got to stay humble and be ready for the opportunity. You don't get many chances to close out the NBA Finals in five games, so that's the goal. That's what we're focused on. We're going to come here, we're going to play really hard, give great effort, and we know the fans will show up and do what they've done all year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,We're going to come out here and try to close it out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"Going back to the first day of training camp, that feels so long ago. I do remember everybody getting intense because it's competition. I feel like that's what brings out the best in us. We just start competing. Emotions start flaring and you get to the moment of truth. It's competition, bottom line. For us, it's competition. We leave it at competition, and that's what it is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"The difference y'all don't see is the will I feel like he plays with when he gets in the playoffs. Everybody expect it to be skill, talent, finesse. He brings a different element. It's rugged, it in the mud and it's winning basketball still."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"Everybody looks at one side and says, oh, we like the way they play, it's finesse, it's this, that and the third. He brings an element of no, we are in the mud, we are going to grind this out and, at the end of the day, we are still going to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,I know what it feels like to be in that position. I know what it feels like to be in that situation. We have had guys be down 3-1 in our locker room and them share their experiences and their stories.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"For us, man, it's the first to four. That's the mentality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"K-Love has been a great asset to our team, just not only on the court but off the court. Him sharing his stories, especially down 3-1, he talks about how they go into the locker room and have a conversation and they go out and will wins. It starts with just getting one, and then you go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"You build trust, connection, brotherhood. It goes down the list. But it all ends up us being connected and as one. I feel like when you have that much connection with somebody in the moments of truth, you all can be honest with one another that this needs to be done, this needs to happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"I think their offense is all unpredictable. He's a great passer, so everybody is live when he catches the ball. I don't think it's just the pick-and-roll. I think it's when anybody is sitting there, you're thinking they are not cutting, they are cutting. When you think a guy is not open, he might be open. So I feel like that's the biggest challenge that we have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,"Obviously, when you have a special moment like that, you're obviously very happy no matter what situation you're in. To see the joy on his face for him having his baby, obviously, his wife is healthy and everybody is healthy throughout, that's the blessing that you get. That's the blessing he probably needed. That's great news for all of us that we probably needed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,BAM ADEBAYO,Very unique because he brings a different style of game and different type of pace to the game. You can't scout it. It is what it is. The biggest thing for us is making him take and make difficult shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,He just started this process while we were in Denver. So it's one thing to be able to go through all of this. It's another thing to be cleared to play an NBA Finals game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Taking it one step at a time, and we are all really encouraged by the progress."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Laughter I'll start with that one. My two sons are just starting to get into soccer, football laughter. So hopefully we can get a ticket and hopefully I can take them to some games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In terms of mental toughness, yeah, that's like a muscle. First you want to get the type of guys that are built for this, and then you work at it constantly through the regular season and the playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And we had enough practice at that during the regular season, a lot of tough times and I thought the guys really handled it the right way in terms of letting that be something that made us stronger collectively, learn from those lessons."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And then, you know, during the playoffs, it's always about that. It's how you respond to things that you don't necessarily anticipate or things that you thought would go differently. That's so much of the playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And with this group, you know, the one thing I've definitely taken from them is they have a competitive will that's as strong as any group I've been around."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"You know, find a way to win. This is -- this is great competition. You know, I say that over and over, but this is what you want the Finals to be like."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Our guys, when I say they have a competitive will, they love to compete. They love big challenges. They love to have everything out there in front of everybody to see between the four lines, and you play for it. You compete for it, and you decide it between those four lines."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And this is a very compelling series. I think it's great for the fans out there because you're seeing some great, competitive basketball that doesn't necessarily fit into the conventional box, certainly their two guys and their team, and a thousand percent our guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's not the conventional way. But, you know, it can be done differently when it's about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. I thought we got off to a great start the other night, and that didn't necessarily translate as the game went on. They started to impose their competitive will on the game, and the game was more on their terms, more -- the tenor of the game was really more in their favor, and that's typically what happens when you're in the center of the ring, toe-to-toe. It's who can get who to blink who can get who to have to adjust who can get the game on their terms, and they were able to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But you know, we are fully capable of doing that as well tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It felt like we had opportunities offensively to score. Some strange things happened on some of these possessions, or just misses in the paint or some untimely miscues that led to turnovers. It's not as if they are scoring 130 on us. Just the context of when they would score or a breakdown that just kind of kept things at bay."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Every time we felt like we got it to six or eight, they were able to push it to 12. That was certainly a frustrating part of the game. Brown was a big part of -- some of his random drives and plays in the middle of the paint when you're expecting it to be Murray or somebody else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's been a little bit different each game. Tonight it was probably those quick hands, either stripping us when we had advantages on drives, the kick balls that Jokic does very well, deflected passes or just some miscues. It's not like we had 25 turnovers. But whatever the turnovers were -- 16 15 or 16 -- they just led to scores that were deflating going the other way when it felt like we had an advantage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So it's probably a combination of some of those timely against-us turnovers and then some makeable shots that we didn't make during those stretches when the game was in the balance, when it felt like it was four, six, eight, during those moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'll have to go back and track that, but that's where I felt like probably the advantages were missed the most during those moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's tough to say because Jokic was in foul trouble so they went to other things. Jokic shot some threes. That changes the dynamic a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"For the most part, I thought that that part of the game was okay. It's the Gordon dunks or cuts Porter had a couple cuts and then Brown, when Jokic was out, those drives and plays that were kind of just random plays, attacking plays, which he is fully capable of doing. Those were probably the most costly things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Everybody is already talking -- sorry to cut you off. Everybody is already talking about it. I've been in those games, Game 5. Those are not the easiest games, at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"All we're focused on -- I told the guys, feel whatever you want to feel tonight. It's fine. You probably shouldn't sleep tonight any amount of time. I don't think anybody will. We have an incredibly competitive group. We've done everything the hard way, and that's the way it's going to have to be done right now, again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,All we are going to focus on is getting this thing back to the 305. Get this thing back to Miami. And things can shift very quickly.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's going to be a gnarly game in Denver that is built for the competitors that we have in our locker room. By the time we are getting on that plane, all we're thinking about is get this thing back to Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We get an opportunity to play a super competitive game in a great environment. That's going to be an awesome environment. Our guys are built for that. They love that, and particularly, I'm sure, everything in the next, whatever, what do we have, three days in between. Yeah, we understand what the narrative will be, but that's the way it is with our team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It doesn't matter about confidence or not confidence or how we feel or what our mood is. Our guys love to compete. Our guys love to compete. We get another opportunity to compete and take this thing one step at a time. Get this thing back to the 305. We do that, all right snapping fingers. That's how quickly things can change."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Obviously, we have some things to figure out, but we have an extra day to do that. The mindset, you don't have to question that. That's what everybody is already thinking about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's going to be inspiring plays. You stack inspiring play after inspiring play. Right when I took him out, because that's when he was going to come out, it was about four and change, that was one of the most impressive multiple-effort rebounds. It reminded me, that's something Dennis Rodman would do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Then we are going to stack a bunch more of those kind of plays in Game 5. Our guys love this kind of deal with the stakes and the context of everything. We're not even going to think about what's after that. All we're focused on is getting this thing back to Miami.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I felt like the size was more of a factor in Game 1. I think there was miscues, lack of communication or rotations tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Now, he is fully capable of doing what he is able to do. He's big, he's athletic, he's a great finisher and he has a real good synergy, all that stuff. So you have to respect that, and then conquer it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Tonight, there are some more relief points that I think we could have handled better. That doesn't guarantee that we would have been able to get the stop. But my instinct says, before I got to the film, that it felt like more of those kind of things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, right now, disappointed as a group, and that's all right. We've got tonight to feel that, and then just becomes shifting that mindset."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Like you said, this is what this year's been all about for this group, so definitely not going to hang our heads or quit. That's not an option. It's not going to happen. So we'll band together and get on this flight tomorrow and find a way to figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"We'll watch it. Don't want to react, knee-jerk react to whatever it was right now. Obviously some of the cuts, some of the transition. We had some untimely turnovers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Some of it, like myself, is just keeping the ball in front. They have got some guys that were more aggressive tonight, so we've got to have solutions for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, they are helping a little bit less on drives, it seems. Scrambling. Definitely give some credit to them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"For us, it's going to be about being detailed and running good offense, which we are capable of doing. But yeah, as the series goes on, both teams are going to make adjustments. Not necessarily surprised by that. But they are a good team. They have got a good scheme, and it's on us to continue to try to figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Obviously it attracts a lot of attention, whatever action he is in. So when you garner that sort of attention and focus, people flying at you, he is good at creating advantages, putting two on the ball and finding somebody open. A lot of times it's on that short roll. He got some skips tonight as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,They are good cutting off the ball. It's going to require a lot of discipline. He's obviously scored the ball but also passed the ball well in this series. We've just got to continue to try to make it difficult on him.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Defensively for them, they switch a lot and try to blow stuff up to their guys, get them the ball, try to get them the ball. In theory, I guess it's a faster, more physical group. Offensively, player movement, ball movement."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, they are both intelligent players, always processing the game, trying to find spots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"For us defensively, we've tried to do some different things to slow them down. We've had some success in pockets. But like I said, they are great players. It's not like you're going to wipe them out entirely. They're so much the focal point of what they do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It's just going to continue on us to continue to obviously have a competitive will and spirit defending them. But then also, like you said, mixing it up and trying to do different things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I thought we had some big-time efforts on both ends of the floor, particularly defensively on both Murray and Jokic. I thought guys just flying around, doing everything they can. Caleb, in particular, Jimmy, Bam."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"So the effort is there, absolutely. That's something obviously you can control. So just continuing to build off that and just get a little more detailed with the execution on both ends."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"We believed and we knew how good we were for a few years now. So we're just focused, dialed in, and ready to do this thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"We're just ready to win a championship. We have the tools to do it. It's been on our minds for a while. We're just locked in. I don't think you've got to overthink it. We're just dialed in, ready to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"I mean, that's why we got him. That's why we got him. He's a dog. He's strong. He's physical. He's tough. He's chill. He brings everybody together off the court, and he's a selfless player. He's been solid this whole Playoffs, this whole season, the whole time he's been here. He's been great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,He just wants to win. We all want to win. I think we're all helping each other try to accomplish our goals.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, tonight it just felt like they were blitzing every pick-and-roll, just basically trying to limit my shot attempts, and I just wasn't fighting it. We've got a squad. We've got a lot of guys that can come and impact the game, a lot of guys playing with confidence, so I'm not going to fight it. Make an easy pass, and that's why I've got four other guys out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,My guys did a great job. Jeff hit a big three. AG was doing his thing all night. Bruce was hooping. We've got a lot of guys that can come in the game and hoop. You don't have to fight it. I'm not on a team where I've got to force it or hold the ball too long. I'll gladly give up if we're winning games.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"If Jok goes out, we got five other guys on the court. If I go out, same thing. Everybody is just playing for each other. Game is slowing down. I'm just picking my spots, when to pull up, when to pass, when to drive and get in the teeth of the defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"I felt like I impacted the game, and I really didn't shoot well. I had a lot of late-shot-clock, four-seconds-left, gotta-get-it-up shots. I'm going to live with those if everybody else is hooping. If I've got to take those for us to get shots every other time, then cool."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Everybody else stepped up and we had a lot of fun playing together. It was a team game and some guys played good for good stretches and some guys didn't and they'd pick it back up. Everyone that got in the game tonight hooped. All our vets gave us good energy on the bench and told us to stay locked in. Like I said, it was a great team effort today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he's energy. It's hard to bring that kind of defensive energy every night. He's running corner to corner on offense and guarding their best players, guarding pick-and-rolls, fighting over screens. He brings an energy. When we see him get into guys and into the ball like that, it just picks everybody else's intensity up. He's been doing that all season. Bruce too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, team game. Guys were just locked in, just trying to focus on getting the W tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, when you play a team numerous times in a row, you've got to know what's coming. They know what we're doing, we know what they're doing. We're going to keep adjusting, mixing things up, but everybody is -- he's locked in. KCP is -- it's a defensive game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, last series was up and down, guys were flying. Shots were going up against Phoenix, guys were going up and down. This game was more of execution, no turnovers, rebound, get stops and stay together, and Jok has been just doing a great job of communicating what he's seeing and what we've got to do out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. I wasn't even -- I don't know. I wasn't paying attention. Just whoever is out there is out there. It's not the first time he's sat down in the game before. So guys were just stepping up, making shots, playing the right way and having fun. Everybody came in the game and impacted it in a positive way. Yeah, everybody just stayed calm and played basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Oh, yeah. I imagined being here when I was very young. Just having fun and making the most of the moment. Yeah, it's been a long time. I think not just for me but for everybody -- most guys that play basketball, this is where you want to be. I think we're all just locked in and trying to get this done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, like I said, it's a different series. I don't know what LA scored every game, but the game felt a lot more up and down. This one feels -- like we're getting stops but they're getting back, as well. Coming down, I'm getting to the rim, getting chased down. We've got to slow down, execute. Lowry is doing a good job of calling what we're doing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"But we're all on a string. Everybody is rotating for each other. Even if we make a mistake, somebody is there to step up, and if that person makes a mistake, somebody else is there. Even if we don't get the stop, we're all in the right mindset. I think we're doing a good job of just playing for each other on both ends of the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, it's definitely something that we talked about as coaches going into this series, and even with the players and the importance of understanding that you have to be ready and willing and able to defend all 24 seconds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Kind of reminds me of San Antonio back in the day. They would be like the league leaders in their field goal percentage in the last five, six seconds of the shot clock."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"So they want a slower pace, if you will, and they really exhaust the entire shot clock. That's where your defense is really tested because that first rotation, that second rotation and then having the effort and discipline to continue to do that through the entirety of the clock. Something that our guys have done a really good job of, in my opinion."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's going to come down to our ability to guard the three-point line. To me, that's where the series will be won or lost. Can we take the three-point shot? The one game that we did not do that, obviously, Game 2, they made 17 threes. That opens up everything else for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, great memory, great recall. We lose Game 1, and then halftime we are down in Game 2 and Jamal has not played well to that point in time. The backstory to that was I don't think Denver had won in San Antonio in like a decade. So now we are looking at potentially going down to San Antonio 0-2. I think there were a lot of people clamoring for a change, which is what people do. They panic. Right now, people want Michael Porter out of the lineup. Michael Porter is not coming out of the lineup, man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"And that moment with Jamal Murray five years ago, our first play -- and I just remember grabbing him as the third quarter was getting ready to start, telling him I loved him and I believed in him and just go out and play his game. He won us that series in the second half, because now we go down to San Antonio 1-1, end up stealing that game in San Antonio and wind up beginning Game 7 on our home floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's when I think you saw that Jamal was built for this. No matter what was going on and the adversity he may have been facing, he is going to find a way to rise and show out on the biggest stage. He has done that ever since."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is a must-win for us. This is the Finals. This can't be human nature, ""We came down, got one game, we can relax."""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Each game, each possession, each quarter are way too important. As I told our players, when we got on that plane to come down here, it wasn't just to get one win. Our mindset is to go out there and take it tonight. It's been our mindset for Minnesota, Phoenix, Lakers and now Miami. Go out and take it, because they are not going to give it to us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,This is going to be a hard-fought game. We expect them to come out with great energy. Forget matching that. We have to exceed it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"He is 26 years old, man. This is the Finals. Whatever they throw at him, we are ready for. Our guys are ready, willing and able to go out there and do whatever it takes to get this win. And if that requires Jamal playing 44 minutes once again, so be it. We'll read the game as it plays itself out, but I know Jamal is definitely ready for that challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I don't think we are big-time favorites. We've never had that mindset. Throughout these playoffs, we've been the underdog quite a few times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"You're in the NBA Finals. They are here for a reason. We are here for a reason. I think you can see in the first three games, two really good teams, a lot of talent, a lot of fight. We don't expect any of this to be easy, nor do they. And that's the way it should be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"So yeah, I don't buy into the whole big-time favorites. That's from your perspective, not from ours."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, you go back to that third year when we lost to Minnesota in game 82, which was, in essence, the play-in tournament before the play-in tournament was put into play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"The thing that jumped out, we lost that game in overtime, but Nikola and Jamal, a third-year player, a second-year player, they were out there playing at a high level. That showed me and that showed our front office and, more importantly, I can remember Josh Kroenke coming up to me after that game and being excited about what the future held because of how well those guys played with the stakes that were obviously going on during that game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that was really early on, but even prior to that, Jamal, Nikola showed that they had a chance to become what they are today. I'm just thankful that we as an organization have given that the time that is required to get to this stage. Most places, that does not happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Zero discussion about making any changes. Again, Michael Porter is a big part of our team. We would not be in this position if it wasn't for him. We are not just Nikola and Jamal. We are a basketball team, and Michael being a big part of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"As far as him kind of getting back into his groove, I talked to him today about understanding that we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for all the contributions and growth that you've shown us throughout this year being healthy. Go out there and play, be aggressive, shoot the ball with confidence and, remember, you're not a specialist. We don't bring in specialists. Those are guys that are not suited for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"We want guys that if you're not making shots, you're doing something else to help your team running the floor, rebounding, contesting, whatever it may be. Michael has that within him. I have no doubt that -- and I mean this I have zero doubt in my mind that Michael Porter is going to have a big game and help us win a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,We have a terrific coaching staff. I'm really fortunate to have the guys on my staff.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"But at the same time, I think you have to give credit where credit is due. Nikola is just a different player. From day one, what stood out to me was the skill level, the ball handling, the ball passing, the soft touch. He is a guy that works on his craft. He not just a guy that shows up and does that. The amount of time that he puts into his game I don't think is documented enough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, Nikola is gifted with his IQ, his intelligence, his vision, but as you also point out, his ability to finish around the basket with a variety of shots with both hands."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think all the players in that locker room look at him, and especially when we hit adversity, and he is always calm. I think he has a great way about him. Never gets too high, never gets too low and really just kind of stays the course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"For him, like he'll tell you, it is basketball. It's not life-and-death. Keeping it in perspective. But with that being said, at this stage, we understand that we have a chance to do something special, and he leads that charge. I think just his calmness when things are roughest really kind of settles down the guys around him, because they look to him for his words but also his body language and his positivity. That does a lot for our group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys stepped up. We were up 13 going into the fourth quarter, they start off 8-O and that coincides with Nikola picking up his fifth foul. So they came out aggressively. They have us on our heels, and usually in the regular season when Nikola went out, things kind of went haywire."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I can say not just tonight but throughout these Playoffs, however many games we've played now, the non-Nikola minutes have gone really well. We called a timeout, we ran a play, ATO, Jamal knocks it down. Really well executed. The unit that was out there, Jamal, Bruce, Jeff, Aaron, and then KCP or Christian, they defended. The fourth quarter we held that team to 22 points, 39 from the field. We outscored them the second half 53-44."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"And then Bruce Brown in the fourth quarter was amazing. He had I think 21 points, 11 of those were in the fourth quarter. They were giving Jamal so much attention that let's get Jamal off the ball, let Bruce make some plays. He was aggressive, got to the basket, made shots, and tonight was an impressive performance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought Aaron Gordon was huge all night long. He brought his hardhat tonight and was just a warrior on both ends for us. Nikola, he had another great game. And one of the best stats of the night was Jamal Murray had 12 assists, no turnovers. In a game where he was getting blitzed and bodies thrown at him all night long, did not have one turnover, and that's just remarkable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Truly a team win. We're not satisfied. We're going home. We know we have a lot of work to do, and we're going to take it one quarter at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, to your points, 27 points, 6 rebounds, 6 assists, making threes, getting to the foul line, guarding at a high level. Aaron did it all for us tonight. He really did. We've seen that now in four games in the Finals where Aaron has had moments where he has carried us offensively. He made threes tonight, obviously, which is always a good thing, but I couldn't be more proud of Aaron Gordon and his impact across the board tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, just understand that we haven't done anything. I told our guys, the first thing I said, we're not celebrating. It's a good win. We've done our job. But we're not celebrating like we've done anything yet. We know we're going to have to go home and turn off the TV, the radio, don't read the papers, don't listen to everybody telling you how great you are because we haven't done a damn thing yet. We have to win another game to be World Champions, and we're going to do that by simply taking it one quarter at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"We stay true to our identity, we'll give ourselves a great chance to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think Jamal regardless of what's going on, he's going to step up. He's going to find a way to impact the game, and the most impressive thing for me was he had 15 points tonight, and he was 5-of-17 from the field. But 12 assists and zero turnovers, and just kind of, all right, they're putting two on me, let me make the right play. He did not get bored with making the right play. He did not say, I'm going to save us and try to carry the team. He just read the defense, made the right play, and trusted. That's a big part of our culture is trusting one another."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought Jamal's trusting his teammates tonight was just at such a high level. I'm really proud of his performance, and again, it wasn't just Nikola and Jamal. We're getting really, really big contributions from a lot of players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I'll say, I think that's two games in a row, and even the first game that we won, our defense has been playing at a high level. I've got to give our guys so much credit for being locked in, being disciplined. That's three wins now where our defense has held them under 100 points, and the three-point line once again was a huge part of that. Only eight made threes for them tonight, and our guys are locked in. We're focused."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I can't speak for Joker. What I do know is this This is four rounds now, Minnesota, Phoenix, Lakers, and now Miami, where our bench overall has done a really nice job. You know all season long, it was like oh, the non-Nikola minutes, kind of a crapshoot. You're watching the game like this sometimes shielding eyes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"The Playoffs, our guys have -- we cut our rotation down. We're limiting who we're playing. But the guys that are out there, they're competing, and they're defending. Maybe our offense may not be as beautiful as it is with Nikola, but the five guys that are out there are defending, and that's the key to that group playing well and being able to get back in the game after they started with an 8-0 run themselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys stepped up, and got to give a huge shout-out to the 18,000 fans at Ball Arena tonight. I remember when I first got to Denver, we couldn't get 18,000 people in that building when we were there, and the fact that there's 18,000 people at Ball Arena tonight supporting this team, a lot of love for those fans. Appreciate the support."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Can I say that I envisioned him scoring 11 points in the fourth quarter on the road in Game 4 of the Finals? I can't say that. But I did envision him being a ball handler, a playmaker. I watched him for the years that I've coached against him, I watched him in the playoff last year against Boston, saw his impact of guarding guys like Tatum and Brown, but his ability to facilitate, play with the ball, play off the ball, make shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"And the one thing I know about Bruce, I know he went to college down here, but he's not afraid. We got a lot of guys that have a quiet toughness about them, and Bruce Brown is definitely one that embodies that Boston toughness that he brings to the table every night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, and Billy Kennedy was at one of those games, so he was laughing at me. We looked at each other like, not again. Thankfully it wasn't a long delay."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think right after that, I hope the woman is okay. I think they wheeled a lady out tonight, so I hope she's -- I'm not sure what happened there. Hopefully it wasn't a Nuggets fan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,MICHAEL MALONE,"As far as Nikola and the ankle, he's tough, and I could tell that he was fine. He just had to kind of keep it loose and don't allow it to get stiff. But he's resilient, and he's tough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"I thought it was there. At the end of the day, they just made more plays than we did. Brown had a huge impact on the game, Gordon as well. We felt getting Jokic in foul trouble was to our advantage, but we just couldnt get over the top."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"We gave ourselves a chance. We got within striking distance. But on both sides of the ball, they just made more plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"They are a very good team. They are here for a reason. They have a number of guys on the team that can play both sides of the ball, make big impacts. It was Braun last game. They had a couple guys this game who hit shots. Even Green hit that shot in the corner."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,Just a number of guys making good plays on that side as well as on the defensive side. We just have to regroup and try to push the series back here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"Just like we say here, stay in the saddle. We know that anything can happen. Has been done before. In a Conference Final and Final, I have been part of it before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KEVIN LOVE,"You really just have to take it one possession at a time. Forget the game. Its just one possession, one quarter, half to half. Just get it done by any means necessary and figure the rest out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't know what I was saying. Probably to get us in some action, just don't have empty possession. To be honest, I don't even remember what I was yelling. In the moment of the game, probably I saw something that I don't know now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, it's still one win. We need to win one more. I like that we didn't relax. We didn't get comfortable. We were still desperate. We still want it. That's what makes me happy, that guys didn't relax."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I'm just happy that every year we've grown as a team and every year we were getting better, and now we are in this situation. We will stick to the guys that we draft or whatever, and of course we add some really good players that accept our culture or our style of play, and I think that's why we are in this situation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, my journey is -- I don't think it's that interesting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course. I think that's where you see the growth, and like you said, maturity in his game. I think he was amazing today. Yes, of course he was shooting 5-for-17. Of course, some nights you miss, some nights you make. But he's our leader, and we are following him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not a big -- 23, 12 and 4? Fourth ever to 23, 10 and 4? I mean, I don't know. Nice. It's good. I really don't know what to say."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, we believe in each other and that's the most important thing. Like I said, we didn't relax, and that's what I liked the most."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That team did something amazing, and we know that they are capable for making history. We respect them. I respect them a lot. We as a group are going to give them the respect that they deserve, and we're going to play -- like the first game of the series, it's a must-win for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes. Actually he texted me, for real. Yes, he texted me. For real. He didn't lie. Yes, he's amazing, of course, in his sport and he's making history every time. Probably he's going to go as one of the best ever, if not the best ever. He has a nice opportunity to win another one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's just an amazing sport and having him as a countryman that he represents us in the world, I think it's a great honor, and I think the people of Serbia are really happy that we have him as our countryman."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, to be honest, it's something that -- since year one, whoever was kind of speaking my language or I'm trying to kind of stay in touch or whatever, some guys maybe a little bit more, some guys a little bit less, but I'm trying to stay in touch with everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't think so that he went to Belgrade, to be honest. I think he stayed in Miami. Maybe he likes Miami more. Yes, he's my good friend, a good friend, and I'm happy that -- last game was Vucevic, too. So I have a couple friends in the stands."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Maybe Mike can answer this question, not me. You know, he's playing a different role, and that's why he sacrificed himself and that's why he's a great teammate, and that's why he won us the game today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think if you sacrifice yourself for something bigger than yourself, the team, whatever, he sacrifices himself, and that's why I think the one upstairs gave him the game today, gave him the game that he had. He was our best player on the floor, and guarding the best player every night, that's a tough job, and maybe he's not going to get a lot of credit, but we know what he's doing for our team, and we're really thankful for him and we appreciate him a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course. He had an amazing night, and he was really aggressive in the fourth quarter, and that's what -- him and Aaron were really, really good. They were amazing. When he did a step-back three, I almost -- I wanted to punch him, but when he made it, I was so happy. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's the same as Aaron he's learning, and he is accepting, and that's what the best thing is about him. He was really good tonight, aggressive, attacking, and not being scared of the moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I've always said I believe in my teammates, and Aaron was the best player probably in his team back in Orlando or one of the best. He had a completely different role. Like I said, he sacrificed himself. That's telling a lot about him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"As long as we win, I'm good, whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I mean, in the Playoffs you start winning when you're winning on the road. That's what DJ and Jeff has told us, and they are right. Of course every round we won on the road, and I think that's stunning about us, too. We are not scared of the moment. We believe in each other, and especially on the road you need to trust each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"The only way is together, and that's how we won the games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I think I'm playing the same way basketball. Maybe experience, maybe knowing. I really don't know. I mean, I'm playing the same way basketball the last 15 years probably. Maybe I'm shooting more, maybe I'm scoring more maybe. But I think in a global -- I think ""experience"" is the word probably."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, most definitely. Joker is such an incredible passer, such a floor general out there. He has such a high IQ and such a basketball knowledge for the game. He sees plays steps ahead. So he's reading the defense before he even catches the ball or he's reading the defense before the play is even initiated."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I'm just playing in that dunker, and it's putting that low man in a difficult position. Do you step up? He has such a lethal floater in the middle of the lane, that do you try and take away the floater or do you try and take away the lob. If you take away the lob, you've got shooters in the corner. You've got KP and MPJ. So it's putting the defense in a pickle. Jok just makes the right play every time, and that's how it's been from the start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I mean, that's just how this team is built. We have guys that can step up night in and night out. Sometimes it's not going to be your night, and sometimes it is going to be your night. This team does a good job finding the people that are kind of in a rhythm and kind of going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Just to keep shooting. Try not to force it but to continue to shoot your shot. But Mike is a great player, and he's going to find ways to involve himself in the game, so he did a good job attacking the basket and finding cuts and making plays all over the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,I'm not worried about Mike. Mike is going to make shots as long as he keeps shooting. So that's all we're doing is just encouraging him to shoot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"As far as making shots, I'm just taking the ones that they're giving me, taking the open ones."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"No, not really. It's just gamesmanship. That's part of the game. When you make a three in the corner with the opposition's bench, you can have a little fun with them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I mean, that's the MO. That's the MO. Just throw it up, I'll go get it, anywhere around it. They're making really good passes, really smart plays and putting the ball on the money, making it easy for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, we have counters and counters to our counters. If Mal is being overplayed or working too hard, I can kind of offload some of that ball-handling responsibility and kind of get him some ones, some easy looks within the rhythm of the offense. So he's not having to work so hard, having to bring the ball up 94 feet, be guarded and then doubled."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Just trying to make it easier for him, having him play a little bit off the ball. Yeah, so he's not working so hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"The difference between -- I mean, we always want to get stops and get out and run. I don't think we try and do anything too differently. We don't post as much. We play more five out, more pick-and-roll when Jokic is out. I think that's probably the majority of it. When Joker is in the game, we're going to go through him in the post."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Even when he's in the game, we still run the chase action, we still run high pick-and-roll action, and we do that when Jok is not in the game. It's more on the defensive end. We're able to switch 1 through 5, hopefully get stops and then get out and run. Our defense is our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"We take a lot of pride in it. We know we have a very potent, high-powered offense, and offensive players with Joker, Jamal, Mike, KCP, Brucy B. Going down the list, we have guys that can put the ball in a bucket in a multitude of ways. So we know what's going to win us games is defense, and we've got guys that love to play defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Joker doesn't get enough credit for his defense. He's spectacular with his hands and with his coverage, and KCP is the same way. Incredible just ball awareness, understanding where to be and how to strip down. It's awesome out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Well, it's pretty good, right? So far, so good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I felt like I was going to be a defender for this team, a defenseman for this team. I knew they could score. MPJ, one of the best shooters on earth. You've got a two-time MVP in Joker that can do everything on offense. You've got Jamal Murray that can go for 50 on any given night. I knew I was coming in to play defense and make their job easy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"That's what I like to do. I like to play defense. That's my niche. That's how I came into the league, defensive-minded."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"As far as the offensive side, it was just get in where I fit in, find cuts, find openings, find transition buckets, try and get easy ones, and then just -- really just get in where I fit in. That was really it. I really liked it, man. It was one of the teams where defenses were just like -- they have to pay attention to so much out there that I was kind of like able to cut unnoticed sometimes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"It's really rare. It's a blessing. It's awesome to play with these guys. These guys are so unselfish. They're so passionate about basketball, and they understand that you've got to keep energy in the ball, and if you play the right way, everything will work out the way it's supposed to. We can win. Everybody gets love when you win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, it was nice just knowing that I could be myself, and that was enough. I didn't have to be any more or any less. Yeah, that was cool. I get to just do what the team asks of me, and sometimes it's score, sometimes it's rebound, sometimes it's defend the best player, sometimes it's make plays. It could be something different on any given night, but every night I get to just be myself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Well, it's been fun. It's been a very -- it's been a learning experience. Now I get to learn with a great coaching staff, with great players around me, through a great organization. I've been able to pick it up pretty quickly, but I've always been a versatile player. I've always hung my hat on versatility and being able to do whatever it takes to win, regardless of what it may be, and it's just nice having a team like this and having a coaching staff like this that believes in you and trusts in your work."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I think we do. Especially when we've got like MPJ cutting, they're expecting him just to be out spotting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"I feel like we have a counter for pretty much everything. When we're clicking, we're gelling offensively and defensively, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"Well, he was just telling me to help Jamal out because Jamal was getting blitzed for the pick-and-roll. He just told me just don't leave him stranded, flash when he gets blitzed. They're smart, really smart. We were able to kind of alleviate some of the pressure on Mal a little bit, but for the most part Jamal was making the right play every time. He's so unselfish. He was a point God today. He had 12 assists, no turnovers. He didn't fight it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,AARON GORDON,"He could have. He could have tried and forced it, but he didn't. He played the right way. He took what the game was giving him. Man, he really played a great game because they were trying whatever they could to stop him, trying to do whatever they could to stop him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It was great. We wanted to come in and try to not only get one game, but get both of them. And we did exactly what we wanted to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Game plan was just to communicate, make sure we get to the right spots down the stretch. Game 3, we knew we had a lot of slippages, and tonight we wanted to correct them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I felt we would have still come out with the W the way we were playing throughout the game. But Bruce was amazing, getting to the rack, pull-up three, an and-one and also knocking down those free throws. He was big for us making those points in the fourth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Oh, yes. I always tell AG, man, continue to play his game. When youre shooting threes, no up, no in, so make sure you get that ball up so it can go in. He did that tonight. We were so proud of him to continue to be confident and shoot the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We're excited, but the jobs not done. Weve got one more. Were just going to take it back home and try to close it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just the excitement. Like you said, coming into the locker room knowing we're up 3-1. Here we can enjoy the moment. But weve got one more to get back in Denver."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"Same thing it's always been, it's one game at a time. Now we are in a must-win situation every single game, which we're capable of. Some correctible things we've got to do, but it's not impossible. We've got to go out there and do it. We've got three to get."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we were up a little higher, trying to make sure that we showed bodies on there coming off the pick-and-roll. A couple of their cuts were kind of, you know, just random and kind of just landed in their lap."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"But, you know, I think we just got to find a way to kind of keep the ball in front of us. It happened tonight. They got good cuts tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"No doubt. We don't have any of that. We don't have no quit. We are going to continually fight, starting tomorrow, to get better. And then we are going into Monday and do what we said we were going to do this entire time and win. We have to. We have no other choice. Otherwise, we did all this for no reason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,The guys know. We know. We've got something to do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,It's always a make-or-miss game. It's a make-or-miss league. I missed some shots. That's just part of it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I don't think missing shots for our team will ever make us win or lose a game. I think we had some lapses, and not getting back the cuts to offensive rebounds, those are the areas that we can control that we do have to fix. Whether I'm missing shots or somebody else is missing shots, those are the areas we have to be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think so. I think we really do believe in one another and ourselves as individuals. We've done some hard things all year long in this playoff run as well, and now it's like the hardest of the hard. But like we always say, you know, the things that you want is on the other side of hard is, I don't know what."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"So that's where we're at. That's our reality, so we've got to go out and win three straight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, I won't do it. I got too much faith in my guys. Their shots will fall. They have been the reason behind us winning so many games, and I'm not letting that faith in them waver. I won't do it. I'm going to continue to play basketball the right way, pump confidence in those guys, and we are going to always live with the result."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JIMMY BUTLER,"Go ahead, Kyle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we understand we have to thrive and we've got to win. I think it heightens our intensity. You know, I think it's win-or-go-home right now, and our intensity has been really high, but when you get into these situations, you have to really be focused on every second, literally every second."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"I think just be ready to play. Gabe's been unbelievable this whole playoff run, this last couple months. Gabe is a tremendous basketball player. Our league is a make-or-miss league, and you have a guy in Jimmy Butler who is going to continue to pump confidence into him. I'm going to pump confidence into him. He's going to come out and have a great game in Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,KYLE LOWRY,"We are all going to get some rest, recover, and get on that plane tomorrow with the mission in mind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it's been great. It just shows the work I've put in each offseason. Remember, when I first came in the league, I couldn't shoot. I wasn't confident shooting the ball at all. I was a mutt guy. They left me wide open and let me shoot. So that took a toll on my confidence, but it put a chip on my shoulder."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"So I just got in the gym and worked, and now it's showing on the biggest stage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, AG was being extremely aggressive. They were switching a smaller defender on him or in transition he had a smaller defender on him. Every time we want him to be aggressive. He will make plays for us. He'll make the right play every time, and tonight was his time to score, and he was hitting threes, so that was huge for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, so I'd seen -- I was just reading the defense. Jimmy's strength, strong side corner, so if I drove, it was going to be a tough shot. The shot clock was already low."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"But yeah, that's been my go-to move if I want a shot off the dribble my whole life. Once I seen him back up a little bit, I went for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, they shoot the ball extremely well, especially Duncan, Strus, Gabe, K-Love and Caleb. So really just try to fan out when Jimmy is under the basket but still give help. But yeah, try to get them off the line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, if they're going to send two to Jamal and then leave Jok open in the pocket, somebody has to step up. So basically it's a 3-on-2. So someone is going to be open. Usually since we have great shooters on this team, it's someone under the basket. So we just try to capitalize."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"I would say -- they kept going on runs to end the quarters. They were playing extremely well at the end of the quarters, so we had to fix that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it's great. I don't know if it's happened before or maybe it has. But it's great. We were focused. We were locked in. They won one on our floor, so now we've got to be focused for Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, we've just been extremely focused in practice, walk-throughs, shootarounds. Everybody has been locked in, going kind of game speed, just going through their plays. So we knew exactly what we needed to do, and we locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, not a lot of time but we've played without Jok. He sat out a few games earlier in the year, and then we knew they were going to try to get the ball out of Jamal's hands. For me, I knew it was my time to be aggressive and try to make plays, get to the rim. And if I don't have a shot, find my teammate."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"No. I'm not thinking about it too much. I know coming into the league what I could do. It was just a team had to give me a chance, and Dwane Casey did. I started my rookie year, did very well. So I thank him for that, but now doing it on this stage, it's amazing. I'll think about it when we're done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,Our whole season hasn't been easy. We just seem like we just -- we won't quit. And I feel like that's what he means. We just will not quit.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Spo definitely made it an emphasis to attack the rim, to really get to the rim, me and Jimmy, everybody included, really get downhill and make things happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"For them -- where is it? perusing stats. I feel like they got a lot of rim attacks off of minor mistakes, lack of communication and certain skirmishes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Keep going. That's the biggest thing for me. Keep forcing that, keep getting to the line, see the ball go in and live with the result."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"That's how you do it. You take it one game at a time. We've seen a team come back from 3-0 firsthand. So we just have to believe, and one game at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Amongst us? A lot of people pissed off. But biggest thing is, first to four. That's the biggest thing, first to four. We take it one game at a time and we figure this thing out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like the first thing is getting downhill, and then you live with those results. If our shooters are open, kick it out to our shooters and then make shots. Then get back on defense and make them take tough shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Watch film. Figure it out. It's a lot of stuff going on in the game. They got a lot of responsibility, and I'm proud of them taking it to the chin. They are going to keep fighting and they are going to keep trying to figure it out, and I believe in them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BAM ADEBAYO,"Obviously having those turnovers can't help us win. Biggest thing for me is watch film, figure out how can I be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Not really. That's pretty much their system, the way they guard. They usually pull guys into the paint, make things difficult. They're a really good team for a reason. They force you to play a certain way. We just got to be a little more intentional."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,I'd say the message is pretty similar. We're not going to get too high or too low. Things are going to be difficult. We just got to continue to stay the course.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I'd say so, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I wasn't really surprised. I think I heard whispers about it a couple years ago, a few years ago. You hear a lot of things. Often, they don't always come to fruition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think it was a great move on his part. From what I saw about the deal, it looks like it was a no-brainer deal, decision to make. I'm happy for him and his family. Hopefully they bring some good soccer to Inter Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I mean, Jokic is a pretty good screener. He typically makes contact with the primary defender pretty well. Jamal can score in a number of ways. He puts pressure on guys immensely."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,They're a dynamic duo. We got to bring our best effort.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I feel like it's the first team to get four wins. Whether we're behind or tied or ahead, we're going to stay pretty even-keeled and keep that in mind. It's the first team to four. That's all that matters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think either one could work. What we did could work, if we followed our game plan a little bit. I think we strayed. We lost our focus a bit on what we could be better on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"Like you mentioned, they picked up their effort. They were good defensively, solid offensively. They're a very good team and they're going to force us to play well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,We're looking forward to the competition in Game 4.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,"To be honest, I don't really watch it that much. I don't know a lot about soccer. I know who Messi is. Pretty cool to have him in our city. Can't wait to meet him, if he comes to a game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,I don't know. I think we got good looks again. But it wasn't about shooting. It was everything else. They just beat us in every aspect of the game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,"They just beat us in every aspect. Loose balls, rebounds. They just out-played us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MAX STRUS,"Some good sleep, rest. Been doing this all year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's been fun developing a relationship with him. We were fortunate enough to be able to spend a whole afternoon during training camp, see how they operate. Then in the afternoon, we ended up just talking shop. That's fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Obviously, he has been to a lot of our games. We've been texting back and forth. We share very similar thoughts about finding strength in adversity and using those as lessons to help you grow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, this is just part of the process. You have to go through stages. First part of it was just shooting, then movement, then contact versus coaches and then the next level of contact in practice. He has not been cleared for a game, and he is still not cleared yet."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, like a lot of these games, there are certain things that you like, and you think that you can continue to do those things. I liked our aggressive attacking mentality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Then there are things that we feel like we have to do better. This is great competition. Those two guys can manipulate your defense in different ways.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"One of the biggest strengths we have is our competitive spirit, nature, just to overcome whatever, even if players play well or a team plays well, that we figure out how to get the win at the end. We were not able to do that. You do have to credit them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Like I said after the game, the film also substantiated that, those areas, ball in the air, ball on the floor, 5050 balls, the physicality parts of the game, for the most part they are winning those. Clearly the rebounding differential was probably the most glaring sign."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"His spirits are great because he is able to work out. Where he was five weeks ago, he wasn't able to shoot and do things that he wanted to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,But he is a competitor. He wants to be out there. He was really excited at the beginning of this playoff run for the opportunity that we felt that we had with this team. But there's sometimes things that you can't control.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Right now he is not cleared to take that next step. He has checked every box so far, but he is not at that next step yet to clear for an NBA Finals game. But he is doing everything he needs to do to take these next steps."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, whatever you do, you just can't do it all the time. There's no absolutes when you get to this level. It's the highest level of competition. You're getting the highest level of execution. Understanding what they're trying to get to, and we try to get them out of their comfort zones as much as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The first half, they really got to that two-man action quite a bit. They were getting a lot of traction, so they didn't need to go to any other part of their playbook. Second half, we did a little bit better with it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Game 4 could be different. They may go to a different part of their menu. Whatever it is, we have to find a way to get the job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know if he'll be on the report because I don't follow that. I think if you have a hangnail, you have to put that on the report. He slipped at the end. But he already did his shooting and his workout, so he is fine. He'll be ready to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,All the experiences are different. You want to be fully present for the team and what is happening right now.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I've said this during this playoff run The more experience you have, the more perspective you have about how difficult this really is. These are extremely difficult challenges. You end up being even more grateful for the opportunities to compete at the highest level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,That's what we all want. This is the stage that you want to be able to compete and have everything decided between those four lines and find out how your team stacks up.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But it is tough. It's tough going through the gauntlet of three rounds to get to this level. Then when you get to this level, it should be what it is. It's the highest level of competition. Our guys thrive in that. They love it. Even after games like last night, our guys love to compete and put it all out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, there was a couple of those, but also the force he was playing with on cuts and drives and in transition. Those were X-factor points, for sure. Now he has had two games where he has been able to have an impact. Throughout the rotation, we have to make sure that we're getting positive minutes and winning more skirmishes than not. Last night, we lost the majority of those skirmishes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, obviously give a lot of credit to them, but I think also just raising our level, sense of urgency, and just attention to detail and focus and just overall commitment to the overall goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"We've already met and talked about it, and we feel good about it moving forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, you kind of said it. This is a game and situation where the urgency should be and will be at an all-time high, especially on this stage, especially here with being down now 2-1. It's a great opportunity for us, and I think we're all just ready to wrap our minds around it and pour everything we have into it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Oh, I mean, that's not something you just turn on once the Finals come. I think all of us, we've been talking about this for a while, especially with -- first off, the guys that have played in this city for multiple years, myself included, but then also really the last month and a half of the year, regular season for us, we were treating them all like playoff games because they were, given where we were in the standings."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"We have a lot of practice with kind of editing our lives and really locking in on what's most important. Obviously when you make it to the Finals everybody gets a text from all the people, Hey, can I come visit you, this, that and the other, and you've really got to delineate between the people that are going to breathe life into you, because you want to have some people around and share it with them because that's what this is about, but at the same time, be able to build that barrier and also spend time and be selfish about putting everything you have into this effort that we have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I mean, yeah, obviously a beautiful city. One of my favorite things is just how international it is, the different cultural influences, and that shows in terms of food and different experiences, like all that sort of stuff. Really enjoy that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And I'm a pretty active person, so I like to get out, play other sports, mix it up, tennis, golf, get out on the water if I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, all that's for the offseason. We're not thinking about that right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, you know, I think it's a group effort. Good offense is a function of just being connected as a group. We've had stretches where we've been really, really good, and we expect to get back to that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"For us as individuals, it's just about being persistent and continuing to be aggressive and confident and hunting for our shots, and when they present themselves, take advantage of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I think it goes both ways. I think we just developed a relationship of trust on the court where he understands what I'm trying to get to, and during rehab, just always reassuring me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Not just rehab but even during games if I'm not shooting well, just always reassuring me and keeping me positive, looking on the bright side and not letting me get into my own head sometimes about what's going on in the midst of the games or the midst of rehabs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,He has always helped me out and kept me in a positive mood or done enough to reassure me. So I appreciate that a lot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, the best word is free flowing. If something is not there, we don't go to it. If it's there, we go to it. If we plan on doing something and they do something different, we adjust on the fly. We call a lot of audibles. Each possession we're talking about what they just did, how we can counter it. There's so many different counters that we can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"We don't fight it. I think that's the biggest thing. Whatever we're doing, whatever the defense is doing, we're not fighting it. We're just reacting and playing and flowing right into our offense and not being stagnant."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a lot of fun to play like that, being unselfish and just make reads."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"He was trying to make subs but I was at the free-throw line, so I kind of had to stay in. Yeah, like I said, it's a cool stat. Just want to win a championship. Just trying to win a game. It's not really worth something looking into or playing for. Just trying to win a game and doing everything I can to impact it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. We just go into every game trying to win. We try to win every game. Home or away, try to win every game. We don't plan on losing a game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Whether we're home or away, we're trying to win. Just kind of react off that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Takes the biggest guy out of the paint. You have to guard him. He can obviously shoot it. I think he just does a good job of just picking his spots, pump faking, getting to the lane or shooting an open three, even shooting a contested one just to keep them honest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,That opens things up not just for us for but for him as well. Opens up his moves and his drives and his passing and all that. He is going to continue to play the game and do a good job of picking his spots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, just a love for the game and trying to accomplish something. We both got our mind on winning, and however it takes -- we always say it might not be your night, but if you can set a good screen, if you can play good defense, get a rebound, if you can hustle, if you can make a timely pass or a shot or whatever it is, that's what we're trying to accomplish."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Sometimes it may not be one of our nights, but we can both impact the game and winning. I think that's where the root of it stems from, is just having a common goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, just making it look easy, slowing the game down. Whether the double team is coming from the bottom or the middle, single coverage to an assign, it doesn't matter. He'll figure it out. We'll all adjust to give him the right spacing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,He has been doing it. He is a two-time MVP. He has been doing it for a while where they're not just having one guy on him. To be able to pick teams apart with his passing and scoring and timely passing is really tough to stop.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"We know. As a group, we know what we can do on defense. We're just trying to change the narrative that he doesn't play defense. He's got amazing hands, timing, IQ, rebounding ability, body position, rule of vert. He's got all that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,Sometimes it's not about how high you can jump and what kind of shots you can block. It's about body position and where you are on the court. That's half the job right there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"He is an elite defender in the pick-and-roll. For what he lacks, he makes up for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think the biggest thing about that is just giving them one shot. They've got a lot of scorers and shooters over there, so we can't keep giving them multiple looks, multiple chances. Even when we do play good defense, it's very deflating to watch them get a rebound and get another chance at it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a collective effort on the board. Like I said, all coming from the elbows and chip in, Jokic battling down there every night and then you've got Mike and AG, normally the second- and third-biggest guys out there cleaning stuff up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"Sometimes it may not be your rebound, but as long as one of us gets it, the job is done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"He is strong. He is strong. He is seven-foot. He's got amazing touch, IQ, passing. He does a great job of just picking his spots, when to go right away, when to wait for the double, when to put the ball on the floor, when to spin. Yeah, he is a tough cover down there. He is up there with the greats."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,I think it's both. Sometimes I'll ask assistant equipment manager Gene Marquez what color jerseys we're wearing so that helps me envision what I'm trying to portray in my head. Just a little trick where it's a little easier for me to kind of imagine the energy I want to bring in the uniform I'm in.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"I also envision like reactions. Like, if I miss a shot, what is the first thing I'm thinking about like, damn, that was a good shot or just next shot or just get back or don't worry about it or am I homing in on it too long. Little stuff like that, just kind of redefining my mentality within the game so when it happens I'm almost prepared for it and able to adjust that way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a lot of fun. A lot of fun. We're all having fun. Trying to solve this puzzle together. Like I said, we've all been dreaming about getting to this stage. We have vets in the league that haven't made it this far in their 15, 16 years of playing. So we don't want to take this opportunity for granted, knowing that this is not an everyday thing. It takes a lot of work to be here, a lot of years of dedication. We just want to make the most of it for everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"We've just got to go back to the drawing board, figure out what we did, all the mistakes and just come with a new and better effort, especially at home. Try to take advantage of the games we can, and just have more of a will to get it done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, just attention to detail, controlling the things that we can control and sticking to the game plan, no matter how the game is going. Just doing what we do, not getting caught up in what those guys are doing making tough shots. We've got to continue to do the things that put us in this position."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think that they were just applying pressure on the boards. It seemed like every time they missed a shot, somebody else was there. We've got to do a better job of getting those guys off the glass and doing our work early."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, they came in with that edge, knowing that they were going on the road. It was going to be a hostile environment. So kind of similar to us in Game 2 on the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think it took just staying with it, just being confident and just understanding that those opportunities, those moments will come. Just preparing yourself mentally and physically for those opportunities to take advantage of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I think that has been the biggest thing so far. Obviously a ton of help and a ton of credit to my vets and my coaches and stuff to put me in this position and getting me mentally prepared. But yeah, just staying ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"He has meant everything to me. He is on the Mount Rushmore of undrafted guys who have made a living in this league. I'm so fortunate to have someone like him, to be under his wing and take advice from him and just learn from him. It's been an honor, for sure, to be around him and to be able to learn from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,I've had a big-time luxury of having him on the team and being a part of this run.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,We need to be as desperate as we've ever been to get these next three. It's going to be tough. We've just got to want it more than those guys.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"We also love the fact that we're competing against a team like that just because it's going to bring the best out of you, and we're bringing the best out of them. So this is what you play for. You don't get to this point without playing your best ball. You've got to also love and appreciate the level of competition, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"It means everything. You have guys like that continue to make the right plays whether you're making or missing, just having that confidence knowing that the shooters are going to continue to get good looks and they're going to eventually fall."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I've got to do a better job of knocking down shots and being more confident, not passing up shots, because when our shooters are shooting with confidence, good things will typically happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"Just not going anywhere. That's how I view it. There will be a time and place to take advantage of those type of things and have fun when you can. You've also got to get away and do things and find ways to keep your mind sane and fresh, especially being in a position like this. But it's not going anywhere. There will be a time and place for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CALEB MARTIN,"I just love to be outside. I'm a big fisherman, so I'm trying to find some spots. Y'all got any recommendations, put me on y'all's spots. Other than that, right now I just like to chill, get some sun and get back in the gym."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, as I watched the film, as we watched it as a staff and then with the team, there was nothing about the historical night that it was. We're addressing all the areas where we have to be better. Too many turnovers, too many offensive rebounds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"And so, yeah, it was nothing celebrating the great nights that Nikola and Jamal had more importantly, it's about how can we find a way to come out tomorrow night and get another one here in Miami heading home to Denver for Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think it was evident from early on in his career in Denver, is that really high IQ, sees things before they happen, a step ahead of most people. What you love about him is offensively, no matter what is thrown at him, he has an answer. He has seen everything in his eight years that you could conceivably come up with as a defensive game plan. He doesn't fight it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's one thing I love about Nikola He takes what the game brings. That's what makes him special. He is able to make everyone around him better. He is able to read the game plan, read the floor, read the defense and make the right play seemingly every time. There's not many players that are that heady, especially doing it at the stage that he is doing it on right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,It's really a luxury to have a player that is not only as talented as he is but unselfish and with the IQ that he has.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Very happy with the defensive effort. You look at the numbers across the board, and our guys were so much more locked in, so much more urgent and aggressive in Game 3 than we were in Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, I can't speak for any other coach, like when you lose a game, the first reaction isn't we have to change the game plan. For me, the first reaction is are we executing the game plan correctly. In Game 2, we didn't. That led to countless mistakes, which led to a lot of points for Miami where we could have been a lot better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Last night only 11 made threes. The defense was much better. The communication and discipline was much better. That is what I'm most proud about is the buy-in, commitment, urgency that we had. It will have to be even better tomorrow night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you go back to Game 1, they made 13 threes in that game. I think six were in the fourth quarter. For three quarters, we did a great job of guarding the three. Then that 21-point lead got knocked down to nine because we opened up the three-point line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Game 2 was 17, way too many. So I think a big message for our guys is we want them to try to beat us with tough twos and eliminate the threes as much as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,He is fine. Just a floor burn.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"When you look at Nikola, so many people just use an eye test to debate whether he is a good defender or not. That is just almost unjust, if you will, because you have to get past the eye test. You have to look at all the things that he does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"He has great awareness, great IQ, great anticipation, tremendous hands to break things up. They shot 34 percent in the restricted area last night. Nikola was a big part of that. Nikola contested 21 shots last night. He had two blocks. He is doing a lot for us to get to this stage in the Finals, and then for us to have a great defensive performance last night, his fingerprints were all over that game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, in my conversations with Jamal coming out of Game 2, going into Game 3, just reiterating to him how important he is to this group. Not just a 30-10-10 night, but more than that. He is a leader of this team, and not just vocally but emotionally."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"I felt in Game 2 he was there, but I just didn't feel him like I know I have felt him throughout these Playoffs. Being in the moment and feeling his energy, I think that is a big thing for me, reading somebody, seeing where are they at mentally, where are they at physically. Forget making and missing shots. But I could tell from early on in Game 3 last night that Jamal was fully present in the moment and was ready and willing and able to do whatever it took to lead this team to a big win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"From the opening tip to the final buzzer, I felt Jamal was just that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think so many people are quick to dismiss people. Michael Porter isn't making shots right now, and we know he is a great shooter. We know what he is capable of. But he had seven rebounds last night, and he had some really good defensive possessions and possessions in which he contested shots and was working on that end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"In this business, if you are just a specialist, we're not for you. We don't like specialists. We like basketball players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Michael Porter is not making shots. He has to find a way to help impact winning through being an unselfish player on offense, being a defensive-minded player, being somebody that rebounds the basketball. And his shot is going to fall."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"If he's taking the right shots and we're generating the right shots for him, I want him, I want KCP, two guys that we know are better than they showed in three games, they've got to keep shooting the ball because that is the only way they're going to get out of that slump."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,But we believe in Michael. He is our starting small forward. I have zero doubt he is going to have a very big game coming up here that is going to help us win this championship.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think it is critical. We have a great offense, period. But when Nikola is making threes, that puts so much more pressure on the opposing defense. I think he has one of the best shot fakes in the NBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"And for a big guy, he is great at attacking closeouts. If you're shooting 40-plus from three and now teams are really worried about that and they're running you off the line or closing to touch, he is shot faking or driving that closeout."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"And now you have a 6-10, 6-11 great passer getting downhill that is going to score. He is an uncanny finisher. He is going to find somebody working behind the defense for a lob, or he is going to kick it out and spray for a wide-open three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's not just the three points that he is making, but the pressure and the added layer he is putting against that defense. It's really fun to watch him pick, pop, shoot, oh, we've got to run him off the line, pick, pop, drive to closeout layup, spray or make a play for somebody else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,MICHAEL MALONE,"That is what defines him for me as a truly great player, every night his ability to make every one of his teammates better players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,Who would do something like that? Had to be Bam smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Honestly, we play basketball for a living. If you get too uptight -- that's been our group the whole year. We got great leaders. Jimmy is loose. Bam is loose. Coach, he's going to smile."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"If you get too uptight, you can wind yourself crazy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Yes, we've all thought about the game. We slept badly last night. I'm sure everyone did. We got to just stay in the moment. The moments don't come often. Seventeen years for me, I mean, it's my second Finals. I'm appreciative of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,I think our group is just a group that understands that it's how we are. We don't get uptight. We just go out there and we smile through everything. We just have fun.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Great. Fantastic. I could do 20,000 jumping jacks right now smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I think they made a great adjustment. That's Playoff basketball. Every single game is completely different. Adjustments will be made every single night. At this stage, two teams left, you got to be able to make adjustments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"That's what both teams have done throughout the Playoff run. It's really a chess match. They did a good job of staying home and making us shoot tough twos, stuff like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"But that's good basketball. It's good for them to be able to make that adjustment. Now we got to go and watch the film, figure out what we can do better, how we can adjust, how we can adapt, get some better looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Man, he's getting a lot of money laughter. It's going to be awesome, man. I think the MLS is a great league. I think they understand how to put the product out there. Bringing one of the world's greatest futbol players out there, bringing him here is going to be awesome. He's going to bring a different fan base. He's going to get some more revenue going. It's going to be a great atmosphere when they get that stadium built. The fans are going to enjoy it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it's great for soccer in America, especially down here in Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I'm a Messi fan. Soccer, I mean, it's great to watch. I watch the World Cups. I'm not good at it, so I don't really love it like that. If I was good at it, I'd be like ""yeah, yeah."""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,Not really.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I think every human being is different in general, right? So everyone is not going to be on the same page at all times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"I think when you have one common goal, it's a lot easier. We watch the film, we'll be in there together. I think that's the one thing about it is that it's not as difficult."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,Yeah...
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,There you go.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"P5 started today. Y'all, go follow P5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"My all-time starting lineup of Villanova would be, got to go with Ed Pinckney for sure. I'm going to go with Tim Thomas. I'm going to go with Randy Foye. I'm going to go with me. I'm going to go with Mikal Bridges."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Then Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, they'll be my sixth and seventh man. I like that lineup. I'm happy with that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Listen, I ain't got nothing to do with that laughing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Honestly, that's a really good question. Honestly. I think through our athletics, I appreciate the guys who went through a lot of the struggles to even get us to this point where we can make decisions on where we want to be. It's about us being happy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, to be able to turn down one place and go to where you want to be, that's the ultimate goal. That's in life. That's in general, right? That's not just with athletics. That's life in general as a reporter, lawyer, doctor, you want to be able to choose where your happiness lies."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"At the end of the day, it's all about your health, health, happiness, family. That's all that matters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"You want to be able to say you're happy, you're smiling every single day, you're breathing above this earth while you can, and you can provide for your family, friends, for yourself, and be able to do it how you want to do it. That's the ultimate goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"We just have to come out and play better. We know our backs are against the wall. We feel if we play our game, stay true to our concepts, we're going to give ourselves a chance to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"They sent their bigs to the glass. Porter Jr. went to the glass, Gordon on both sides of the ball, then obviously Jokic with his 20-plus. That is tough to overcome when a team outrebounds you like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"As far as the deficit goes, I don't know if in a Finals game we've seen it quite like that before. We have to make that something that we're really focusing on, making sure we're checking bodies, getting in the paint, getting rebounds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,We've seen two really big teams in the first and second round that played traditional bigs at the four and five. Also bigger teams. This team definitely poses a threat and makes it tough on you from that perspective. So we have to do a better job.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"I think it's just that understanding what we're doing on both sides of the ball. Being intentional about our game plan. Understanding our concepts. Understanding what we're doing after timeouts, coming into the half, throughout the quarters, staying true to who we are."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"I think that's part of being intentional, as well, is understanding who we are, what we want to get done, doing things with intention. When that does happen, your impact is always going to work out for the better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"He is so creative. Keeps you on your heels in so many different ways because he can shoot it. I know from especially where the game has gone, fours and fives being really good shooters, the game going to a pace and space, that defending that is very tough. It poses a whole 'nother set of problems."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"It's such a luxury for them to have him being more than capable when he wants to be elite at shooting the ball from the perimeter. He puts the ball down on the floor, gets to his spots. If you're going to double, he picks you apart. He is, again, a special player from that perspective."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"Just who we are on an everyday basis. I think that is something that needs to and will come out tomorrow, is the high-character group that we have and our resiliency and our ability to respond. Those are the things that stick out to me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"I think we had a lot of shots at the rim that were tough, were contested, that we typically make. We'll finish those tomorrow. We'll go out and make an effort. We talked about that intention earlier. Make that very intentional getting to our spots. Playing free, playing a little bit more I guess fluid, if you will, be able to knock down those shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,I thought we had some contested ones on the offensive end that definitely could have dropped for us. We felt like we could have broken the paint and gotten some swing swings and hockey assists with those. Tomorrow we'll knock those down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"Stay in the saddle, stay the course. That's the biggest thing we can do. We have a game plan that is proven can work. Obviously, you guys have seen it all year with how good they have been and well-coached they have been, the Denver Nuggets. We feel like we have a game plan that if we stick true to it, understanding that the room for error is so small."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KEVIN LOVE,"If anybody is capable of it, we are. Continue to drill, continue to stay true to our concept, no slip-ups. If we do that, we feel we can give ourselves a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, a bunch of things, to be honest, but good question. Mike, take note Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Depends. If I feel my defender is down the floor, I can set a screen and hold it. If I see that they're going to blitz or show, I can slip out. Or if I see the defender is kind of late, I'm going to slip out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's just an in-moment decision, I think. Sometimes you make a good decision, sometimes you make a mistake. But just probably to change, have a more variable -- I forgot the word, but doesn't matter. Just to have different variation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,Random. Just don't give the same look every time.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, just aggressive movement. When he cuts and is aggressive, one defender is going to take him and that's going to open a lot of space. He was attacking downhill, which helps a lot just to go by the guy or just go aggressive. Yesterday he was amazing. But usually he does the same things. Sometimes he make, sometimes he miss. But generally he is playing really aggressive, and that's really helping us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, definitely it is because we have Jeff, we have Ish, we have DJ, who have been in the league a long time. Okay, Jeff one time was in the Finals. DJ played with a really good team, Ish played with a lot of good players, good teams, and they never made the Finals. It's maybe now or never. I think it's really important to be focused, to give us an opportunity or chance to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think I didn't affect them at all, to be honest. They are really good players. But yes, maybe just try to make him uncomfortable or taking the shot he doesn't want or take it over a contested hand or just to move his hand or move his shot a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,I think don't give an easy one. I think that's my main focus.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"No, I don't feel the same because I only talk about people telling me my stats and I'm trying to say it's a team basketball. I mean, yes, I feel the same way, my friend. I think it's how everything works. In Europe, it's a little bit maybe the team, the winning. Here it's winning, too, but maybe more stats. I don't know. I really don't know. Good question. Mike. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,I really didn't. I don't know.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't think I did. Maybe I did. I don't remember, to be honest. Maybe I said a little bit of something, but I don't remember what, to be honest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it's cool just to see different solutions, how different players think different and how some players are reacting a certain way, how certain players don't react. Especially now, like you remember, so they blitz us a couple times, they steal the ball, then we reacted good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's just kind of bringing a game, like a chess game. They are one move, we are another move. I think this is the time where the players show what they've got."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"For me, it's pretty easy. I just stay at the house. If I'm not playing basketball, working out, I got a daughter, so I spend a lot of time with her, family. I spend time with my family, focusing on what my goals is, not letting distractions to get to my head."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Sometimes I do get on the boat, a yacht, go in the water to get some fresh air, enjoy time out there with friends and family."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Other than that, maybe go to the playground with my daughter every now and then. That's about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,We rent a yacht.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, just me and my family."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, we just going to have to play more harder, play more together, play with more effort. It's a good team, so they're not going to give us anything easy. Everything is going to have to be fought for. We have to play with that same urgency and energy that we played with in Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,He's a good player. We're going to have to lock in on him. Him and Jokic's two-man game is a pretty hard action to stop.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"We got great defensive players, some of the great two-way players in this game, Jimmy and Bam. We're going to figure it out. We got a lot of different bodies with we can throw at Murray as well. We'll be ready for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, it's definitely fun. We have a great connection off the court, so it really translates well to on the court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Like you said, unselfish, we're very connected. It's kind of the same group we had last year. We're all familiar with each other. It's a pretty fun time for everybody being in the Finals. We still got three more wins to go, so we're excited about that and we're going to get that going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,That's a good question.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"Yeah. I mean, I can. Do I want to take credit for that? No. The dinner had nothing to do with it. The guys went out there and we all executed what we needed to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"At my house? No, not there. If we're celebrating that, no. My house would be destroyed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"It's always been. It trickles down from Joker to the last guy on this roster. We all wish for the success of each individual. When they're on the floor, we're cheering. We're giving them all the support they need to go out there and perform. It was evident last night, when you saw Christian go out there and perform like he did and get the praise that he did. It was well deserved."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"But we all support each other. We know that if a guy or the five that are on the floor play well, we play well and we do well. We all support each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"Man, they've been physical. Like, it's the Finals. They came out since Game 1 playing physical. That's the nature of playing in the Finals. It's all or nothing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"At this point in the season, a lot of it's mental because physically the only thing you're doing is pretty much the game. So mentally if you stay strong, if you stay locked in, that's part of the battle right there. The things that Coach has been doing to keep us in that mold mentally have been great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"I'm going to tell you now, I don't know who was on that team. That's no disrespect to the team. I just wasn't aware of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,No. No. I think all our focus has been on the now and trying to accomplish now and the present time and what we have right now and trying to make the best out of that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JEFF GREEN,"No, not at all. Not at all. This team is going to fight, fight until the end. They're going to fight all 48 minutes, every game, every play. You cannot let up. You saw that last game. You saw that Game 1. You see it every game. You've seen it every series they've been in throughout these Playoffs. That's just the Heat culture, Spo, Pat Riley, they have done a great job of implementing what they want their players who walk through that door to be like, to play like. The players, they've done it. So it's our job on our Denver Nuggets team, organization, to come in and to battle, to battle them, to match their effort and energy. I think we've been doing a good job of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Man, I was a little under the weather, so I had to skip that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Just the fact that JG opens his doors to the rest of his brothers and the rest of the organization is just a testament to what we've been doing all year long, looking out for the camaraderie not only on the court but off the court as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"So to come together and break bread with the team, understanding win or lose or draw, you got family, is a very important fundamental piece of being a good team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,Really good. His defense has been really sound all Playoffs long. Really all year his defense has been really sound.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"He's great with his hands, has great feet, great footwork. Like, he led the league in kick balls, so he does have great feet, great hands. Is in the right spot. Does a good job communicating. He's just smart. He's cerebral about his defensive approach. He gets the right space that he needs. Plays with an arm's distance, kind of plays the game within the game, you know what I mean? Makes the defense think about what they have to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"That's all you really want to do as a defender, make the opposition think about what they want to do and it kind of takes them out of rhythm."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"We want to score in transition. In the Playoffs, you want to get easy buckets, as many as you can, because the game gets stymied towards the end of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Throughout the entirety of the game, you want to get out and push. Also, it creates cross matches. If I get out and push, if a point guard takes me, then maybe I can post up then draw a double-team and kick it. Same thing for Joker. It creates cross matches."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I don't think Mike has a bigger critic than himself. I think he's hard on himself. We tell him just to keep shooting. That's the one thing that this team has encouraged since I've been here, is when you get an open shot, shoot it. That doesn't change whether you're making it or missing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Mike is one of the best shooters on planet earth. He has one of the best jumpers that there is, of all time, one of the best jumpers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"We're not worried about that. Mike's going to make shots. While he's not making shots, I just encourage him to get touches. What I mean by touches is, any time you can touch the ball is how you get energy in the ball for yourself, then the balls start going in. Whether it be on offense, trying to get an offensive rebound, a tap-back, a deflection or a steal, a strip. Any time you can touch the ball, just do that and it will start to feel more rhythmic for you. The basket will open up, the balls will start going in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,Really unique. Let's see. Who would I compare them to? I don't know. They're their own guys. Never really liked comparisons.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"They're special in their own ways. Very unique players. So I don't know if I'd compare them with anybody. But, yeah, they're a force to be reckoned with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I've never really cared about personal accomplishments. My first six years in the league, I had six different coaches. Not only was I 19 or 18 coming into the NBA, I was also having to learn a system each and every year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I'm learning a new system, trying to make my way. It's hard. You can't really nuance the game how you would like to nuance the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Now I've been with Mike Malone for two and a half years, I'm understanding what he's looking for, I'm understanding what the team is looking for, the organization, where I can kind of manipulate the game in my own right, where I can play within myself, where I can kind of stretch that, the area of what I can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I've always came in with defensive minded as my niche, then a guy that can make plays and do a multitude of things out there on the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"At the end of the day I'm just out here to help my team win, so however it displays itself in that sense I'm fine with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I'm feeling much better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"I do what I love to do. That's what's so great about it. I get to play the dunker. So I work the baseline, catch alley-oops and drop-off passes and get to bang out. It's awesome smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, they complement each other very well. They are both three-level scorers. They can both use the pick-and-roll. One setting it, one coming off of it, vice versa."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"They're both just downright winners, just gifted at the game of basketball. Talented. Yeah, Joker is redefining the game. You are going to start seeing more and more players that can just do everything, regardless of size."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"He's kind of like breaking that mold, kind of like how Magic Johnson did with the point guard position. He's breaking the mold of the center position of not being only dominant down on the block. Now he's being dominant from 40 feet, out of everywhere on the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"To stay down on pump fakes, so I don't go to shot fakes. Do your best to stay out of foul trouble. Make things difficult for him. To be physical with him. But mostly just stay down on pump fakes and stay out of foul trouble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I believe it. Great team bonding. Just relax, get away from basketball a little bit, even though you talk about basketball, which is fine. Just have all the guys there and like so much respect for Jeff who just invited us to his home, which is a beautiful home, by the way. I loved it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah, just great team bonding, talking, whatever it was, having some wine, great food, just enjoying ourselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I don't know. I haven't sat down with everybody yet. Save that question. I'll get to you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, my words of wisdom is just keep doing what you're doing, keep playing hard, keep going out there and just showing everybody what you can do and earn that respect."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But yeah, he's grown since training camp. He's just continuing to be himself and play his game at his own pace."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah, you're right, no pickup game. It's very impressive, like I've said before, just how composed and like how poised he is in these moments. It's great for us, just being a rookie, young, and being in this moment, he's taking it very well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, there's always pressure. Each game is going to be a lot of pressure no matter where it's coming from. But yeah, you've got to try to -- you don't reach this moment as much as you want to, so you've got to try to enjoy, try to come out with wins by any means. But I feel like just being here, this is an exciting moment. You're playing for a championship, to be crowned world champions. I think that's a great moment in itself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Man, he's amazing. Playing with him -- also playing against him when I was on other teams, his IQ, his level of just playing the game, not much of a vocal leader, but he shows it a lot on the court, and just how professional he is off the court, it's amazing just to watch him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's changing. It's becoming a world -- it's been a worldwide sport, and I'm excited just to see what's next."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just an amazing duo. They've been together for the longest, and just how comfortable they are with each other and how they know each other's tendencies and what works for them and us as a team. It was just truly amazing to watch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Stay in your hotel room. It's all about being professional. We've got something ahead of us that's waiting. We set a goal for training camp, that we wanted to be champions. I feel like that's enough to keep everybody focused and pretty much not do anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different, but here, it's crunch time. We've got two more games if we want to be champions. We've got to be professional and stay locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, just some missed shots. It's part of the game. It'll get better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"But missed shots, made shots, we've just got to win because then nobody is paying attention to it. Which we will do. I will be better because whenever I'm better, we are better as a whole."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"A lot of good. Obviously, he is one of the greatest players to play that beautiful game. I'm so excited for the city of Miami, to be able to have a player of that caliber here. I'm excited for the city of Miami in so many different ways. Obviously us being in the Finals and having an opportunity to do something special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Now that he is here, I think all the footballsoccer fans from all over the world are going to come here and get an opportunity to watch him compete. I'm glad he is here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I grade it 10 out of 10. Nobody on my team can afford it, so they don't want to go there and pay for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"It was very important. Yes, I did grow as a player, but I grew as like a personleader because I just always remember the things he told me more often than anything is everybody doesn't go about things the way that you go about it. But there is an organization out there that does, that being this one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"He just told me everything that the Heat are about was about winning, and he wasn't doing anything that he wasn't supposed to be doing. I'm just saying he had been a legend here, still is, and he was just saying the reason he was who he was was because of the way that they went about things here, and he pointed me in this direction."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Obviously, I expect to win. But what makes me proud is these guys are never out of the fight. They're so joyful because we're in this thing together through good and through bad. I'm proud of my guys for that. I love my guys for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,Tomorrow we're going to come out with a lot more energy. We're going to compete at a high level. We're going to get one at home.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I mean, obviously he has been huge in what we have done all year long. But I think his spirits are really high. He is doing everything that he can to come back and help."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know where he is in that process, but I see him working. I see him smiling. I see him being around the guys, which is good for him and even better for us. We want him out there competing with us. We always have. We always will. But whenever he is ready, he'll be back, and he will be better than ever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Honestly, I can't even tell you the answer to it because he can shoot the ball, put the ball on the floor, pass the ball. You've just got to do everything you can to stay between him and the basket, trace the ball with both hands."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"But he is a hell of a player. He has been very, very dominant everywhere on the floor. You're closing out one of the best players if not the best player in the world. It's a handful for anybody that is closing him out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I wouldn't say that I know him enough, but I have met him before. Will I reach out? Probably not. I know he has probably got a ton of stuff going on anyway. He is coming over here to do something special for this city. I won't reach out. I'm happy that he is here, though. I really am. I know we will link whenever he is here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I mean, he gets me open a lot of the times. Then obviously you have to guard him whenever he is rolling, popping. Then when they get him the ball, he is getting the ball to everybody else andor finishing or getting to the free-throw line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"He has been excellent throughout this entire playoff run, throughout the entire series and throughout the entire season. We need him to continually set screens, get out in transition and do everything that he has been doing to help us win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Keep doing what I'm doing. Look to find my guys open on the perimeter, maybe dribble on the perimeter for some handoffs. Honestly, I can't tell you. I don't know. I've got to go back and watch it. But I know I'm going to find my guys. I have to find my guys if we want to win. So keep attacking and get the ball to my guys so they can get shots on goal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"Being calm, not rattled, is like the best thing ever, knowing that everything is going to be okay, everything is going to be just fine. As long as you give it your all, you go into it every day knowing that you have an opportunity to do something special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"That is what we're doing here. We're having a lot of fun being and competing with one another. That is what we do. Stay calm, stay collected and go out there and do everything together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think it does too much. I just think you have some really talented basketball players on the roster. You have some really genius coaches on the coaching staff and some super genius individuals in the front office. They get everybody on the same page. They get everybody chasing the same goal. They get everybody to give in to the team, let go of the self and really buy into what we're doing here as a whole. Underdog or not, that's just what it is here, and we love it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"I wouldn't change anything. Not one thing. I continue to be who I am. We will continue to be who we are as a group, as a team. We're going to go out here and compete together. We're going to win together. We're going to be who we are. I wouldn't change a thing, though."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,JIMMY BUTLER,"It was good. Puerto Rican food, I'm a big foodie, so any opportunity I get to go be around the city, enjoy food, enjoy really good company with people I don't get to see every day, I'm fortunate to do that. I've got a lot of love for all types of food, but for sure all the food around Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I just think recognizing the attack angle their drivers were going in. Sometimes they're attacking to pass, then sometimes they're attacking to score. Jimmy was killing us in hes hesitation situations in Game 2, finding the shooters. So, we tried to stay home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Definitely was disappointed. But, I mean, that just added a chip on my shoulder to come out and prove what I know I can do in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,Denver was just a perfect fit. Everything obviously fell right in place how we thought it would. So I'm happy to be here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it was great. I mean, not a lot of people like to have people at their crib, especially how nice Jeff's house is smiling. But it was great. The whole team was there. All the coaches were there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,It wasn't even talking about basketball. We were just having a great time being around each other and seeing how nice Jeff's house is smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I think just being a Bostonian. Everybody from Boston loves Boston. Me growing up there, that's all I knew."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I think just the grind of being there, growing up, loving where I'm from, loving the sports, loving everybody I've met being from there. It just speaks for me being from Boston."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Definitely a lot of hoopers from Boston that I looked up to like Shabazz Napier, Wayne Selden, those guys who I've actually watched play. I watched Shabazz play in the BNBL when I was there when I was younger."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Without those guys, I don't think I would be here. I didn't think a kid from where I'm from can make it out. Those guys played a huge role in my success."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, that duo is just almost impossible to stop. They can score whenever they want when they're aggressive. They know each other's tendencies, where they like to get the ball, where they like to shoot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"I mean, for any team it's tough to stop them two. The rest of the team, we got to play off them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"No. No, he never told me that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Miami, our offense, anybody can be the 1. Everybody has to have the ball in their hands to make plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I came into the league as a guard. I started playing guard my second year in Detroit. It's just the role in Brooklyn was the only way for me to get on the floor, so I had to do that. I did really well at it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BRUCE BROWN,Now I like being back in my normal position.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I got a couple, a little more than usual obviously. The same people that always text me texted me. The same people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Nikola. I think Nikola and Jamal put me in the right places. Obviously, our team is set up for everybody to succeed, everybody to be in the right spots. I've said it a million times, it's just my job to be in the right spot when my name is called."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think I've been doing it since high school. I don't even mean to, to be honest with you. It just kind of comes out. I can't really control it. Those are the plays I like to make. Jamal actually told me to run through a pass in the first half, be more aggressive. When I made the play, obviously that's just kind of my natural reaction."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, I'm just grateful to be here obviously. This is something I wanted to do my whole life, something I wanted to do since I stepped foot in Denver. I'm grateful to be here. Just really enjoying the opportunity, enjoying the moment, enjoying the basketball games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"He's not big on advice. I mean, that's just not him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like I said, he puts me in the right spots, makes my life a lot easier. Same with Jamal. Me and Jamal talk a lot. Like I said, he was the one that told me in the first half, Hey, could have run through the pass. Be more aggressive. Like I said, put me in the right spot to make that play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They help me and help everybody on the team, put everybody in the right spots, make everybody's life easier. So we appreciate those guys. Obviously, we're going to ride them to a championship for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, I think there's so much attention on Jamal, on Nikola, that guys like me, Mike, AG, Bruce, KCP all look better. They make it so much easier on us. When they do make those plays, it's our job to make their life easier, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,We wouldn't be that open if there wasn't that much attention on them. They make the right play every time. Playing with guys that make the winning play and make the right play every single time on the court is really fun. I think that's what this team is built around. I think we're doing a really good job of it. We got two more games.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think he found me a little more than I found him obviously.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I mean, we got to find a way to beat the zone. They're a really good team. They make really good adjustments, have a great coach. We got to find a way to beat the things that they throw at us. They've thrown different things. They've thrown the press, they've thrown the zone at us. Try to give you a lot of different looks, try to keep you on your heels."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They've doing a really good job of it. Our coaches are putting us in the right position, too, to counter them and beat them, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think the biggest difference, I just think the adjustments. I mean, in the NCAA championship, it's one game, who's going to play harder, who makes shots. It's just one game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"This, every time after a game, you got to go back and make adjustments. You don't know what the team's going to throw at you. There's more opportunities to get it right in this, but you have to be consistent, you have to stay healthy. A lot of things got to go your way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's a lot of differences, but I think the NBA Finals is more fun, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I mean, obviously Nikola, especially for me, like I said, makes my life a lot easier, makes me look a lot better on the court. So I'm very grateful to play with a guy like him. Just the style that they, how skilled they are, is a great addition to our game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Nikola, obviously Im grateful for him. We're all grateful for what he's brought, the consistency he's brought to the organization."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Force them into difficult shots and, when they miss, get the rebound."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Considering I've been in that position the first Finals, having to sit and watch your team go through that battle and try it figure it out without you. But I think he is in good spirits. He is definitely inching his way back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"But the biggest thing is him getting healthy, at the end of the day. We want him to be fully healthy so when he does return, if he does, we'll have that same Tyler during the season where he was being that bucket getter that we know him for."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"How did I get through it? I mean, me personally, it was just I had to be on the court in a different way. That was me talking on the bench, me giving energy. Anything I could do that would put me as close on the court as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Biggest thing is just read and react. Easier said than done, obviously. But pretty much read and react and watching film."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"One, it's Spo. So that's only a Spo term."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"We've been through so much this season, ups, downs, goods, bads. A lot of you in here probably never thought we would be in this position right now. So I feel like that is what he means when he says a gnarly team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"Watching film, watching some of the greats screen. Then obviously the way we run offense. Everybody is involved. Everybody is prepared and everybody is ready to rock. One through 5 are alive. My screens are the biggest thing to get the guy open because if he is live, I'm live, that makes everybody else live, and that is a good recipe for success."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"I didn't even think about that. What's today? Wow, that's tomorrow. Ain't got a lot of time for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,I don't know what I will be getting them. I'm pretty sure they're fine if we don't get them anything.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"The biggest thing is we'll be playing on their birthday. Coming into this building and getting a win, I feel like they'll both be happy with that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"You trust one another to do their job, and you let the chips fall where they may. You trust 1 through 5, 1 through 15. You trust the staff. Everybody has a belief that you can get that job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"If everybody has that belief and everybody comes with the right mindset, that is how you can get it done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,BAM ADEBAYO,"No. You see a person, they shoot the ball, you see who is closest to you, you box them out and everybody will run for the rebound."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,I think their approach was great. I think they got to their two-man early and it was pretty effective for them tonight.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,"We can be way more intentional following our game plan. We got away from that a little bit. We have a small margin of error, so we got to be more detailed with our stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,"Every team weve played this playoff run has had quote-unquote size on us, so we arent going to start making that excuse now, respectfully."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,GABE VINCENT,I think that was more of a product of our lack of detail offensively. Just our spacing and attention.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's complex. It's a headache. They can beat you with the pass, beat you off dribble, beat you from the three-point line, in transition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So it really becomes about collectively wrapping your mind around doing really tough things. Sometimes it's not going to be perfect or how you thought it might go, but you have to compete and find a way to overcome."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, for sure, it's way more impactful when it's coming from your two best players. Jimmy and Bam both are really unselfish. They both want to play the right way. They want to get guys involved. They understand intellectually how important it is to have everybody as a live weapon."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,So you see them make a lot of simple plays. It doesn't have to be their play. It could be a play just where they get off the ball and other guys can be recipients of that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In terms of the shooting, our guys always have that green light. They have the confidence of everybody. But we've also proven that we're not totally reliant on that because you can't always control whether you're making shots or not. You still can compete and find different ways to win a game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I wouldn't necessarily say that. But we're still day-to-day. I don't have another update for you. He is scheduled to have another full-contact workout tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He has not been cleared yet. So until he has been cleared, a lot of this stuff is really just hypothetical."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it has to be a sprint. You have to have a next-play speed mentality, for sure, because if you're late or you glitch for a second, Jokic is such a great defensive rebounder, if he gets anywhere from 12 to 15 to 18 rebounds, how many of those -- 10? -- will be bust-outs. So it's a little bit different than some of the transition stuff we've been dealing with in previous series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But the common denominator is trying to take away some easy ones, relief ones. We've had some practice in playing against speed teams in the previous series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yes. I think that would be good. Yeah. I think it would be good. I don't know what the unintended consequences are, but I always feel like if I burn one whenever, early in a game and you win it, it's like, oh, geez, I would like to have another one. But then we're dealing with -- if that is the case, then all the players starting the first minute of the game twirls finger in the air. I hate that, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's a challenge. Yeah. That's why it transcends scheme. It really becomes a mentality. Our guys love to compete. They love big challenges, love to be out there in front of everybody, out there for everybody to judge, to see, but to really have it be decided between those four lines."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"All the time. He is the voice I trust more than anybody. I listen to my staff -- we're in the trench every single day. Pat and I's relationship has evolved in so many different ways over the years. Now it's really -- he is just a calming presence. Sometimes in those moments in between, probably if you see us maybe in the stands or after practice or something, everybody probably thinks that we're scheming and planning and all this stuff. A lot of times we're just BSing and he is asking how the kids are doing. He just has a way of alleviating some of the pressure that we all feel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't think that's fair. I don't think anybody can predict that. None of us are Nostradamus in terms of that. What you try to do is just find like-minded guys where we speak the same language, where it's a fit, and then we can figure out the rest. Then ultimately we all have to prove it on this kind of stage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But when you're not speaking the same language and you don't view competition the same way, whatever your culture may be, I think that's where it can be a little bit complicated."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's a great duo. Their games really complement each other. You have one guy that really can score in a lot of different ways. Another guy who is setting great screens or handoffs, and if the ball gets back to him, he can get a bunch of people involved."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Certainly at the beginning of game, that kind of set the tone. But from there, we lost a lot of physical 5050 or ball in the air, ball on the floor battles throughout the course of the game, at key moments. When the moments could have been swing moments, they were coming up with those plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,You have to expect that -- not losing the battles. You have to expect there to be elite talent in the Finals. Both those guys are elite-level talent.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"At our best version, we find ways to overcome that, make it tough on them and then certainly not lose the overwhelming majority of those physical battles, the 5050 battles, the ball in the air, ball on the floor battles."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That made it too much to overcome. The dynamic of those two, but also getting all the extra, effort points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, I wouldn't even say that. They just pummeled us in the paint. They didn't really have to shoot threes. They had, whatever, 60 in the paint. They probably shot over 65 percent in the paint at the rim there. Wasn't a need to space the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We didn't offer much resistance. A lot of those plays were relief points in transition that kind of gave them some separation. Some cuts, some timely cuts and then timely offensive rebounds that led to either buckets or free throw attempts from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I thought offensively, we actually did get a lot of opportunities in the paint. I haven't even seen the percentage I don't have my glasses right now. But I would have to say our percentage in the rim or in the paint was pretty poor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yes, you do have to credit their size and everything like that, but we have proven that we can finish in the paint when we're at our best. But offensively, yeah, there's some -- definitely some things where we got flattened out, and they jammed us up in possessions. Got us late into possessions. Then sometimes we're forced with those plays, and that can kind of have a different flow and feel to it than if it's just in our typical rhythm of our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I just think sometimes, for us, when we lose a lot of those physical battles, the effort plays, the loose balls, the rebounding battles, that's our identity, and sometimes that can affect the flow of the rest of your game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's not an excuse. I think the thing that we've proven over and over and over is we can win and find different ways to win regardless of whether we have confidence, regardless whether the ball is going in. We have a determination to impact the game and find a different solution or different way to win a game regardless of whether the ball is going in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It felt like at times, some of those missed shots at the rim or in the paint, the makeable shots that we've made the last several months or weeks, that affected a little bit of our, whatever, going down the other end. And that hasn't happened a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I do want to get to the film because I'm not totally sure about that. Just it felt like that. We're at our best when we're winning those battles first, so you can just check that box, the physical battles, 5050s, ball in the air, ball on the floor. We win those battles, we figure everything else out along the way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Yes. Laughter. Well said.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I would think so. They probably felt the same way coming off their loss. The extra day, whatever, they -- yeah. Our guys are built to compete, built to get out there. That cadence of playing every 48 hours, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We'll get to work tomorrow, for sure. But our guys, they want to get out there and compete and have a better showing for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, there's a lot of different layers to that, right? Your offensive execution, your intentionality offensively of getting the right shots. It certainly helps making some of those shots in the paint or at the rim."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But regardless, we have proven that we can figure it out even if we're not making 70 percent of shots in the paint or on rim attempts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But then your floor balance matters, and then your next-play speed, the brain speed to get on to the next play and make sure you have three or four guys back, and then communication from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They did get some relief points, particularly in that first half, when it was either tied or we had small leads that they just came right back with some relief points that just kind of kept them alive and kept the momentum shifting a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"The last shot felt good. It was more like throughout the game. I felt like I didn't bring the intensity that the moment called for. Even though I didn't play terrible, I felt like I could have done a lot more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Most people that have watched the Nuggets play, when I have a game like that, I'm most likely going to bounce back. Just one of those days. I think not just me but everybody bounced back. Everybody brought the energy. K only took four shots but he was into everybody. Michael was grabbing boards, even though he wasn't making shots. AG, same thing, 10 boards, didn't shoot well. Actually shot 50 percent. My bad."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, just everybody was just coming into the game and wanting to bring the intensity that we're used to playing with. I thought CB was great, and I thought Jeff was great, and everybody was ready to play tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he knows what to do to stay on the floor. He's solid on defense, shoots the gaps, plays hard, in the right spot he crashes, plays solid defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"He knows the offense will come when he's doing those things, and he's playing with a lot of confidence. We're finding him like he's a five-year vet. He's just playing the game the right way, every game. Even if he makes mistakes he knows how to bounce back, and I think that's huge for a rookie, especially getting these kind of minutes. He's got a lot more game to come, not just in these Finals but in his career. Excited to see what he can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"What he does, he makes it look so easy. You grabbed 21 boards and everybody is talking about he can't jump, and he's out there battling everyone, he's physical, he's strong, 30 points, people say he doesn't want to score. Gives you 32. Then 10 assists."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"He just makes the game look easy throughout the game, and like I said, just free throws, his touch, his creativity, his no-look passes, his II could go down the line. He's a special, special player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'd say it's a trust and a feel, that's the best way for me to put it. It's not really X's and O's. It's just reading the game and trusting that the other is going to make the right play. If he throws it to me, he knows and expects what to see from me, and he knows the mood I'm in, the intensity I'm playing with, whether it's low or high, time and score, and vice versa. I know when he's overpassing, I know when he's looking to score, I know when he's the best player on the floor, I know when he's taking a second to get into the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it's just a feel and a trust that we're going to figure it out, and it's a lot of unselfishness, like I keep bringing that up. It's free flowing. If something is there, we go. If it's not, we don't force it. He makes tough shots look easy, and he's been doing it for a very long time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,I think the consistency doesn't get talked about enough.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"As the shot clock was going down and I just got to my spot and just sunk it down, just a drill shot that I practiced basically my whole life."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think we've got a great team bond. We're very tight. Everybody is comfortable saying something to each other, getting on each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I told CB at halftime to shoot the gap and get the steal. He had a chance to do it in the first half and he didn't go. Second half he went for it. Just the confidence he has to go in the game and gamble like that seconds after I just told him. Like I said, he's going to grow and he's going to be a very, very solid player in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'm excited to see him develop his game and gain more confidence, more trust from not just us, the coaching staff, as well, and see him grow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it's a mixture. Sometimes it's an effort play. Sometimes the ball just comes to you. Sometimes somebody else does the dirty work and boxes the big guy out. I think it's everybody chipping in to get those rebounds. That's not an individual stat. Like I said, Mike on the boards. AG on the boards following his own misses. I'll come in and help out. Joke is down there battling every time, every game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"So I think it's a collective effort. Sometimes you may not get it but you may be the reason that somebody else gets it, and I think we did a great job collectively giving them one shot and getting out and running."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"You know, if people ask, it's a big stage, do you get nervous and stuff? You're supposed to be. That's what makes you care. That's what makes you alive. That's what makes you enjoy these moments. It's good to feel that. I just kind of get into zone, meditate a little bit, lock back in, knowing this is what I do, this is what I've been doing for my whole life, this is what I've wanted to do I my whole life. This is the stage I've been working personally to get to my whole life."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"All the butterflies, that's supposed to happen. That shows that you care and that shows that you're excited."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Not just me but he's always checking on guys, seeing their mood and tone, and I just think he does a great job, especially at this stage, of communicating what he's thinking as well, not just picking your brain."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"But he has, like I said, we've been playing together for seven years now, and he's got a lot of trust in me and my capability and most of all the energy and intensity that I bring. He's excited for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"He knew it wasn't my best in Game 2, and he looked forward for me to get it back in Game 3."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it speaks for itself. It speaks for itself, bro. Like I said, how many times does he have to do that for you guys to believe in his game or our game or whatever? Like he's doing it, making it look so easy, good shooting, low turnovers, two blocked shots, got great hands, great communication in the pick-and-rolls, and IQ and all that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I say, we're running out of things to say. He makes the game look easy, and like I said, the consistency that he's doing that with, not just the first time in the Finals, he's done that before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's fun to play with, fun to watch and be a part of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, that was crucial for us tonight, points in the paint. They did a great job of getting the ball to certain places for Jokic and getting him and Murray in their spots. We have to do a great job of making it tougher on the catches and putting more pressure on those guys to get tougher looks than that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I think so. I mean, they are two great players. They obviously had triple-doubles and they can get it done, whether that's passing, playmaking, shotmaking, whatever it is. That's the reason why they are playing for a championship right now. They are one of the best duos in the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"But I don't think that we did enough, as much as we are capable of doing, and making it tough on those guys, kind of like we did in Game 2. Just find ways in adjusting to the fact they are getting to their spots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"We just have to have a better approach mentally. Whenever their shots are falling, we can't let that trickle into our offense. Make sure we stay with it and put more pressure on those guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, they did a great job of staying home and making our guys make tough twos. They made adjustments. That's part of it. That's part of the playoffs. You're going to see different coverages, different looks every game. Every game is going to be a different game. So that was the game tonight, and it will be a different game, Game 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it was more than a few. We had a lot more than a few breakdowns in Game 2 and give them credit because they took advantage of almost every miscue that we had or breakdown that we had."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"A huge part of it for us is just cleaning up our communication. That was the main message in our film session, in our practice, in our shootaround this morning was getting our communication going early. But when you have a guy like Max Strus or Duncan Robinson, who are elite shooters, it's all about getting separation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"They're doing a really good job of creating separation, and we're doing a poor job of allowing it. So, communicate early, be more physical, take away their airspace, and try to make them play inside the three-point line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Oh, it's between Jamal and I. He understands how important he is to this team. He understands how much I care about him, not just as a player but as a person."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,My job is not just to point out mistakes. My job is not just to applaud guys when they're playing well. It's also just to be there for them and provide whatever support I can.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I do that for everybody, not just Jamal Murray. But yeah, that conversation will just kind of remain private if you don't mind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I mean, so they start Kevin Love, I think six points, 10 rebounds, three offensive, two made threes, and a guy that's been on this stage before, so you know he's not going to be rattled."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But let's be honest, the guy that he replaced could have been the Eastern Conference Finals MVP. So, it's not like Caleb Martin is not a good player, but I think for them, it was making sure they just had a little bit more size in the game, help with the rebounding."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But give K-Love credit, man. That guy is a journeyman. He's really impacted this team with his professionalism, maturity, and the three-point shooting, the rebounding, the outlet passing, whatever you want to call it. He did a really good job to help them in that second game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I would echo what Jamal mentioned. It was really neat with Jeff having a house -- he was nice enough to have us go over there and break bread with his family. The whole team went. It allowed everybody to reset, take a deep breath, take the edge off."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,And yesterday's film session was -- wasn't an emotional film session. That's not going to get us anywhere. It was a constructive film session where everybody had a chance to speak up and talk about each clip and what they see and how we can be better.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I also agree that we are a very resilient group. We've proven that year in and year out, whether that's being down 3-1, whether it's having guys out to injury. This group never ceases to amaze me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I believe that maybe us losing a game at home for the first time in the postseason and playing the way we did, you never want to go through that, but you have to take a negative and make it into a positive, and maybe that's a wake-up call. Maybe it's like hey, man, understand the moment that we're in, and don't ease into it and be disciplined in your approach, be urgent in your approach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,I have no doubt that our guys will go out there and play a much better game than we did in Game 2 in Denver.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think all of us were disappointed, from myself to all of our players. We were disappointed in Game 2, how we performed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"The funny thing is even after the third quarter, I think they had 75 points and 43 percent from the field and were up eight. I don't think we had played well to that point. Then the start of the fourth quarter, obviously that 15-2 run was a deadly run and kind of gave them some separation, then we got back in the game late."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But the last couple days I think there's been some frustration, and then the second part of that is coming together and realizing that all we have is each other, and we're going to need each other to play a lot better, a lot harder and a lot more disciplined if we're going to regain home-court advantage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's the first time in Finals history or maybe NBA history that two guys have 30, 10 triple-doubles, so that's incredible right there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Regarding Nikola, nothing he does surprises me ever. This guy has shown time and time again that he's built for these moments. He thrives in these moments, the biggest stage. He did that once again tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I'm really proud of Jamal, and I could tell speaking to him yesterday, being around him the last 48 hours, that he was putting a lot of Game 2 on him, and it wasn't just him. It was me and every one of our players. It was collective."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But that's what champions do. That's what warriors do. They battled back. I felt his presence all day long. Forget the stats for a second. I felt Jamal's presence, his energy, and he was here in the moment, and for him and Nikola to do what they did tonight in a game that we needed to take, regain home-court advantage of the series was special to watch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But it wasn't just those two. I felt Aaron Gordon 11, 10 and 5, I thought Michael Porter's seven boards and Christian Braun. I have to give Christian a lot of love. I felt his play was fantastic. Did not look like a rookie, aggressive, strong, physical, confident, and his 15 and 4 off the bench in 19 minutes were very, very impactful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Good win for us, but we did not come down here to get one win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I've been with Nikola for eight and Jamal for seven years now, and we've had some pretty good moments, but not in the NBA Finals. For those guys to make history the way they did tonight, no one has ever done that. I mean, that's what's really neat about it. You get the win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought our defense was fantastic tonight. You hold that team to 94 points, 37 from the field, only 11 threes, that really helped us out tonight. The defending and rebounding at a high level, but by far their greatest performance as a duo in their seven years together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"It means that our guys understood Game 2 was not who we are. It's not who we can be, especially at this stage of the season, and they responded like they always do. That's one thing I know about our group When we don't play well, we own it, and we find a way to be resilient and get back to playing Denver Nugget basketball, and that's what we did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Christian has proved himself all year long, and he was in the rotation end of season. He's been in the rotation throughout these 18 playoff games now, and if you look around, there's not many rookies playing meaningful minutes in the NBA this time of year, and it speaks to Christian's confidence. It speaks to him being a winner. He's won at every level High school, college, and now he's in the NBA Finals as a rookie in the NBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"He just has stayed ready the whole year, mentally, physically, emotionally. That kid never gets too high, never gets too low. Very calm, cool and collected young man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Tonight, man, I could just feel the confidence kind of oozing out of him, the physical aggressive drives, making plays for guys against their zone. It was really fun to watch a young man step up like the way Christian did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've always felt that Nikola and Jamal Murray are one of the most elite and lethal two-man game combos in the NBA, and we've seen that growing for seven years now and I think it was on full display once again tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"A lot of guys play with each other. I think those two guys play for each other and off of each other and they read each other so well. The best part about it is early in the game, Jamal was getting blitzed tonight. He had two guys on him a lot, and he didn't fight it. I think early in the Playoffs there were games where he was getting attention and he was trying to make like the home run play maybe at times, but for him tonight to come off -- I got two guys on me? I'm just going to find Nikola in the pocket or Christian Braun cutting, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I was really impressed with Jamal's performance. But those two guys as a two-man combo, they give a lot of people headaches."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, he showed up with that. That young man, like I said earlier, when you win three straight high school state championships, when you win a National Championship in which he never came out of the game, played all 40 minutes, he's very confident, and he should be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"We believed in him, we drafted him, and he's everything we hoped for and more, but that confidence is something that his mother, his father, his family, I think he's had from a very early age."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, usually it's a lot more likely when Nikola sits. I don't know if you guys realized, but Nikola didn't sit in the second half. So when I congratulated him after the game for his 32, 10 and 21 rebound performance, I said, Maybe we're on to something here. You may not come out in the second half the rest of the series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, Jamal is going to attract so much attention, but usually it's when Nikola's off because if you put two on the ball, Jamal, and he finds Nikola in the pocket, something good is usually going to happen The mid-range shot where he's almost automatic, Aaron or Jeff working behind the defense or spraying out to a three-point shooter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's the type of game that Jamal was having, and he adjusted to how he was being guarded, which is what you need from your starting point guard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I felt this is by far our best game of the series, most complete game of the series. It's not because of the triple-doubles, or to your point all the individual stats. It's because we held that team to 94 points, 37 from the field, only 11 threes. And to out-rebound somebody by 25 in a Finals game, that's a significant number right there. And it wasn't just Nikola's 21. Aaron gets 10, Jamal gets 10, Michael gets seven, Christian gets four, 28 assists, 60 points in the paint. And the fourth quarter defense, only 31 percent from field allowed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"I loved our energy, our urgency, our discipline. I thought we were where we needed to be tonight, and we'll have to be even better come Friday evening."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"It is. His one year at Kentucky, he was a prolific scorer, obviously played off the ball with Tyler Ulis many years ago. And I often laugh when I think of his first two years in Denver he was our backup shooting guard, and now he's getting a triple-double in the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, Jamal, he's a guy that thrives, lives and excels in the moment. Never afraid of it. You can't say that for a lot of players. I mean, the regular season guys had really good seasons, but in the Playoffs, on this stage, and Jamal missed our last two post-seasons and he's been dying to get back to this setting, and just go out there and put on the performance that he's putting on. Really proud of him bouncing back from Game 2, as well as all of our players bouncing back the way we did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,MICHAEL MALONE,"Once again, Friday night we know we're going to have to be even better against a very good team in Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"I think one thing about Coach tonight, he knew how they were going to come out aggressive, and we just didn't -- we didn't match the force that we needed -- we didn't play with the force we needed to play with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"You know, I think that was their objective, to get in the paint, get inside and use their size and physicality. And, yeah, that's what they did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"I don't know. Honestly, I think we had opportunities to make some layups but missed them. Short-armed a few of them. Missed some layups. We attacked fairly well tonight. We got to the paint and we got to our spots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,We just missed easy ones. Bam missed some shots that he usually makes and Jimmy missed some layups that he usually makes.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"But that's the game of basketball. You make some you miss some. But we got to the spots. We got 92 shots up, so that's a positive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"I think the game started off with Jamal Murray and it kind of made Jokic's game a little -- you know, a little bit easier. We had the help on Jamal. Jokic is going to get his. He's a two-time MVP. He knows how to play basketball. He's really talented."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"Sometimes, like you say, he's going to do what he's going to do. 32-10-21, that's pretty good numbers. He's seven feet. He can do pretty much everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think Jamal set the tone for their group, and he was aggressive, assertive. And, you know, he set the tone, and it made things a little bit easier for Jokic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we win. I think it's pretty simple. But he's playing phenomenal, I think, the whole playoff. We're just following him, like I said, and he's a really good leader. His energy is amazing, and we are just following."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, it doesn't help when you miscommunication or stupid turnovers or whatever. But they're a good team, and we need to give them the respect. It's not just us. They are playing, too. I think it's a really interesting series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,We just got one today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I just think it's a win because if you lose, nobody is going to even mention -- even to be honest, I don't care. It's just a stat."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I think it's just respect of each other and relationship over the years and communication, and I think -- but it's not just us. I'm always saying yes, we had good games, but Christian Braun had amazing game, Bruce had a really good game, Jeff played really well, AG played really good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not just us, it's the team, and like I said even before the series started, Denver Nuggets need to beat Miami, not me and Jamal and whoever is on the other side. We as a group need to beat them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's reading the game really well. He's getting guys involved, and I think he's mature, if that makes any sense, and he knows where to find the guys and how to control the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"On the first question, I don't know if it's the best or -- I don't know. We're just trying to win a game right now. We can think about that later."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I told him, you won us the game. Like you said, he's a winner, and he won us the game, with energy, just the focus, the mindset. Even when he make a mistake, it's an aggressive mistake, so you cannot be mad at him. I always say that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He won us the game, and he was really good tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes. I mean, this is the right time if you're going to play your best basketball, I think this is the right time to play your best basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But I think, like you said, the team is really important, yes. A couple guys maybe didn't make shots or they didn't play well, but there is other guys who can step up and fill that position and be even better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"When you lose the game, of course it's a bad atmosphere, whatever, it's a bad momentum. But maybe help us to refocus and just be better in the details. But that doesn't mean that we can relax now or whatever. We need to have the same effort because they're going to be even better. So we need just to have the same or better focus and effort in Game 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I really don't know, my friend. That's a good question. I'm just trying to -- when you play the game, sometimes it's open, sometimes it's not, sometimes you shoot, you make, you miss. We really don't think that when you play. I really don't have an answer for you. My bad."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we saw everything. I'm always saying that's why they're so great. They have so many defenses, and they're really good in every defense that they're putting out there. They are so aggressive, they are playing on the passing lanes, they are into the guards. Even in the zone they are so active. Everybody is moving."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,Then in one moment they are blitzing Jamal.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That's why they are so dangerous and they are so affecting the game, and they're changing the momentum of the game and speed of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He has a nice house. Laughter. Yes, he has a nice house."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I mean, Jeff is a 27-year-old veteran. He's a guy who -- he's so professional. I think all the young guys that come into the league or just if they have the opportunity to talk to him or to see his work ethic and see how he is approaching the game, the practice, the workout, the weight lifting. He's really professional, and that's why he's so, so long in the league. Having us in his house, it's a really nice thing of him, and hopefully one time we can come to celebrate a little bit better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, we won. Thats what we wanted to do. I think we came out with a better focus, better attention to start our defense off with communication, which we didnt do well with Game 2. I dont like the way we finished, obviously. Weve got to find a way to finish that fourth quarter and not give them any hope."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"They played amazing. They took what the defense gave them. Jokic, he has been doing it all year. Both of them, Jamal as well. We feed off of those guys. They make the game easy for us and we try to do the same for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"He was huge. He was huge. His energy, the way he made plays on the defensive end that led to easy offensive baskets."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"Hes very very mature for his age. Hes been in situations where he has played for a title, in the NCAA Tournament last year. Obviously, its not quite the same, but the aspect of fighting until the very end and fighting for a championship, he understands and he showed it tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,Thats every game. He uses his size to his advantage. The way he is on the boards. Aaron can do a lot of things on that floor.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"Obviously, I dont think he gets enough respect. Ive always said that. He is showcasing it on the biggest stage. He gives us energy on both ends of the court, the way he defends, also the way he attacks on offense. He has been big for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,Weve got to keep it up. Weve got two more games to win.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,We got a win. Weve got to do it again. We have another game in a couple days. Weve got to bring the same amount of energy and effort.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"Its just one game. Everybody has said it throughout the playoffs Its the first to four. So weve got to duplicate what we did tonight, plus a little bit more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, we won. Thats what we wanted to do.

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I would say that it's what they do every game. They make the right play. They didn't try to force anything. That's what we expect from them, and they make everything easier on us. That's what they do every game and they make the right plays, and they didn't force anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's greatness, man. It's greatness. That's a dynamic duo right there. Like CB said, they make the right play, they do what the game is asking of them, they take what the game is giving them, and that's the type of game that we kind of expect from them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,We're a resilient group. We're a very prideful group. We don't like how we played in Game 2. It was an opportunity to bounce back and just hold ourselves accountable and play to the standard that we've been playing all year long.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Those guys makes it really easy. Playing with those guys, they make the right play every time. My job is just to be ready when my name is called."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Playing with Nikola, playing with Jamal, whoever it is, just got to be ready for the ball, and today found me in some pretty easy spots. Just staying ready, and it's the NBA Finals, so if your name is called, you know you've got to be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's important. When we rebound like that, it's usually a direct correlation to a dub win. We've got to keep eating the glass, continue to rebound on both sides of the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"I think we were over-helping on that. We call it a hes hesitation dribble. You call it Gretzky, like Wayne? For sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"We were just over-helping. He was getting under the basket and we were overreacting, and when we would overreact he would spread the ball out to shooters. Just got to stay home and give the reasonable, respectable amount of help."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, the guys trusted me all year, so when I get in the game, I just try to defend and do the little things, obviously make it easier on me. Like I said, my job is not very hard I've just got to come in, play with energy. And they find me on the right spots on offense and the defense just gives effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,So those guys have trusted me all year and put me in the right spots and my job is to deliver.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Well, we watch this game, we break it down. We have a really, really great coaching staff, so we leave it up to them to analyze the game and break it down and come back to us with a game plan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Essentially we just want to play better. We want to turn up. We don't want stay the same and let them turn up. We want to be the aggressors and yeah, turn up our level of play and be more disciplined, execute better, and just overall be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Man, it's rare. He's a very rare rookie, other than myself. I wouldn't be able to think of anybody else. Smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"No, that's a rare rookie right here. From day one he's been on top of it. This is a real winner right here. I say that because he's always in the right spot. He's in the right place at the right time, and he's been doing that all year, he's been doing that from day one, and nothing changes. He's in the right place at the right time on the biggest stage, and now you guys are getting to see it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"I really think it was our execution on defense and offense but mostly the discipline, the game plan discipline on defense. I think we had far too many breakdowns in Game 2, and I think we had less breakdowns this game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, playing off Nikola, obviously all my buckets tonight were layups, and just playing off of him and playing off of Jamal. So a lot of his buckets come from drop-offs, relocations, whatever it is. So a lot of my buckets did look a lot like Aaron. He's obviously catching lobs and dunking more than I am, but just learning how he moves, obviously I can take a lot from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, those guys trust me, so I can't really fail if I go out there and play hard. They don't expect much from me on the offensive end, but expect me to go out there and give effort on defense, rebound, whatever it is, try to get extra possession for those guys to score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So they trust me, and they put me in the right spots, and all I've got to do is lay a ball in and get a steal. My job is pretty easy, and those guys make me look pretty good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,It was a really big moment. It was a big shot. We need him to step up and take and make those shots. It almost like quieted the crowd and kind of slowed their momentum down a little bit. It was a huge shot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"Jamal is a big-shot maker, big-shot taker. He's an ice cold closer, so we expect that from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think Jamal, he expects a lot of himself, and like AG just said, we expect a lot from him. Those are the performances we expect from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"We know he's going to bounce back, but all of us didn't do what we were supposed to do in the last game. We all felt pressure to come out here and focus and get this win, and Jamal was a big part of it today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I would say that it's what they do every game. They make the right play. They didn't try to force anything. That's what we expect from them, and they make everything easier on us. That's what they do every game and they make the right plays, and they didn't force anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's greatness, man. It's greatness. That's a dynamic duo right there. Like CB said, they make the right play, they do what the game is asking of them, they take what the game is giving them, and that's the type of game that we kind of expect from them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,We're a resilient group. We're a very prideful group. We don't like how we played in Game 2. It was an opportunity to bounce back and just hold ourselves accountable and play to the standard that we've been playing all year long.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Those guys makes it really easy. Playing with those guys, they make the right play every time. My job is just to be ready when my name is called."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Playing with Nikola, playing with Jamal, whoever it is, just got to be ready for the ball, and today found me in some pretty easy spots. Just staying ready, and it's the NBA Finals, so if your name is called, you know you've got to be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,AARON GORDON,"It's important. When we rebound like that, it's usually a direct correlation to a W. We've got to keep eating the glass, continue to rebound on both sides of the floor."

2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"We feel great. We didn't play our best tonight. I feel like we just got to come out with more energy and effort, and that's correctible. That's on us as a group. No X's and O's can fix that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"So come out, dive on the floor, get loose balls, get defensive rebounds and maybe, just maybe, it would have been a different game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"I can only speak for myself, but I missed some that I normally make, along with Bam, too. But we are going to continually get those. Getting two feet in the paint, if you can get a shot up, get it up. If you can't, get it out to your shooters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think we did a good job with that. Maybe we do have to do a better job of finishing. But those are the same shots that we're going to get next game, and we are expected to take and make those."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"One, Jokic can pass, and Jamal is looking to score. I feel like that's what makes it so dynamic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,I don't know. I can't answer that. Maybe we're at home we think we did something. I don't know. It just can't happen. It won't happen again.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"It starts with myself. I have to lock in on the defensive end. I have to go up and get loose balls. I think if I start playing and doing that, then everybody else has to follow suit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know. We're going to get back to the film and figure it out, because we do have to be better guarding both of those guys. One is the ball-hander and one is the guy that is setting the screen and popping and rolling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's not an easy task to do, but if we want to win, we are going to have to figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"All five guys get back. I feel like that eliminates the transition. Everybody get back, low to the ball and we figure it out from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,"Two feet in the paint. Shoot the shots that I know that I can make. Stay aggressive. It's the same thing. I think if guys were open, like I said, I've always got to pass it to them. I will continually do that. But if I get two feet in the paint, I'm expected to shoot a layup or a floater, and I'm expected to make it, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"I mean, I'm in-game, so I'm not really focused on fans leaving. I'm really focused on, can we get a stop, can we score and then see if we can come back in this game with 50 seconds left."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,They look at film. They definitely watched the game plan. The biggest thing for us is watch film and see how we can get Max open again.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,JIMMY BUTLER,Appreciate you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 7,BAM ADEBAYO,"Black lives matter, people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I just feel a great sense of pride, you know, to be able to represent a country with so many people that, you know, really value how we perform and how we play. You know, I just take a lot of pride in representing them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"No, I love Miami in general as a city, the people, the culture, the food, you name it. It's kind of like its own little country to be honest. It's very unique in that way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I'm sure I did it very young. I don't know, man, probably 10 or so. You know, basic 2-3 zone, like most kids probably."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"A little bit. I wouldn't say -- our zone isn't as traditional as many zones are, especially at this level. You've kind of got to be a little creative. But certain principles in terms of making sure you box out and rebound. It's hard to rebound in the zone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I'm not surprised how much we do it. We're just trying to win. I think it's effective because it's different, and like I said, it's not necessarily a traditional zone that we play. You know, other teams in the NBA run a zone or will play zone, and everyone's kind of looks a little different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,It's kind of a different look regardless who you're playing against.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,I think it was just good basketball. We got the ball where it needed to go and we were able to create advantages and move the ball and find an open guy.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,I think that was just my passion talking at the moment and I was just in the moment of the game. I don't think there was anything really to it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Bam's been great, his reads offensively, especially thinking about how much energy he's expending defensively, the way his mind, his brain speed has been going. I think he's been making great reads, and I think he'll continue to, whether it's a pass or shot or attack or whatever the case may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,When I train. I try to push myself to those points of being uncomfortable to try to grow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,At this point that you guys don't know? Probably not. But I definitely have been meditating before each game and it's been quite helpful for me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Oh, no. When we kind of get close to game time, I'm pretty locked in on my own routine, so I kind of miss what they have got going on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I think we just have the habits built for it. We have had a number of close games this season. Probably too many than we would have liked but they helped us prepare for moments like that, when we need to adjust on the fly or, you know, put in a wrinkle, and it's in a pressure situation. The more reps you have with that, the less, quote, unquote, pressure you feel, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think our depth is definitely a strength of ours, and it's been someone different pretty much every game in these playoffs in terms of our supporting cast that has a game or plays well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"All of our guys are capable, and when they get their moment, they usually step up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, if I had our group, I'd like our chances, regardless of who we played."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,The day I walked through the doors.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,"I think it's a lot of what the culture represents and signifies matches who I am as a person. It matches my character. So, I think it was a little easier for me to assimilate to the quote, unquote culture, and although it isn't for everybody, I think it is for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"I love it here. Walking outside every day, the weather is phenomenal. But I will say, the fan support we've had during this playoff run has been huge. They have been phenomenal. They have shown up every single night we've been home and even when we're on the road, we've seen the videos of families, fans, walking the streets, banging pots and pans every time we win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,It's pretty special to feel that love from them and can't wait to play in front of them tomorrow night.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"Keep shooting. I've worked too hard to give up on myself at this point. I've missed a lot of shots in my life and career. I'm not going to let that stop me from shooting and doing what I do. I get paid to do this and I do this for a living. So, I'm going to keep shooting every time I'm open."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"For sure. The way they defend is similar to New York. I think we can still do a better job of attacking, but yeah, I would say it's going to be similar. Similar shots, similar execution on their end of just how they guard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"82 regular game season. We have ran every defense. We have ran every scheme. Spo does a great job preparing us all year to be ready for situations like this, to be able to switch in a timeout, switch a scheme, switch a defense. We have ran every single defense with every single lineup this entire season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"So, it's nothing new to any of us and we are ready to be plugged in at any point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"He just tells me to be me. Love Pat. Love having him around. He's here every single day, and just being able to learn from him. And like you said, he's just been through so much experience in these type of environments, so nothing seems to really faze him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,Just learning from him and watch how he reacts and how he carries himself is enough in itself.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"Not really. Just defending and rebounding is really all he cares about. He's told me to rebound more a couple times, but he lets me play and lets us do our thing and trusts us that with our ability on the court that we are going to do what's best for the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,I wouldn't say I've been impressed. Bam is just being Bam. Bam is an All-Star. Bam is an unbelievable player. One of the best big men in the NBA and we are lucky to have him on our team.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"His ability to guard at that level, one through five, it's special. It's unique and you know, he's been carrying us and he's going to continue to do that and keep playing at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, I think my first day. Just kind of how we go about our business, how they trust in the work, they trust in people preparing themselves and putting in work behind closed doors. That's everything I've done in my career to get to where I am. Continue to work hard through all the ups and downs and keep pushing. That's really it, and they really strive on that here and push you to work harder, and I've just been built like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"So, you know, ever since the first day I got here, I've just felt a special connection and a strong love for this organization."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"I mean, I think we keep backing it up. We keep showing and proving ourselves over and over again. Even when people don't do it themselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MAX STRUS,"So, we believe in each other. We believe in ourselves, and that's really all that matters to us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I did not see Steve's comments. But I think the context of what you're saying, getting guys to get into roles, buy into something that is bigger than themselves, that's arguably the most important thing when you're trying to build a team that can contend for a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's elusive. It's tough. You try to be intentional about it. You try to get guys that really care about winning more than anything, even if they have to sacrifice, or also understanding that that's a prerequisite, that you have to sacrifice."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have a lot of guys that have played a bunch of different roles, that have excelled in different roles, but have had the emotional stability that when their roles have had to change that they're still about the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In reference to Kyle, he's all about winning. At this stage in his career, when you have more yesterdays than you have tomorrows, it's really about these kind of competitive moments on the biggest stage. That's what drives him more than anything, is the ultimate competition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It was a relatively easy decision to take him off the bench because we had to shut him down for five weeks, and when he came back, he had a minutes restriction that he and I were aware of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The first game he came back I played him 36 minutes, so the head coach got yelled at by everybody. Kyle and I met the next day and we were both laughing about it. We needed to protect each other. The only way to do that was to bring him off the bench so we could control the minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We did that the rest of the year. There was really only about a month left in the season. He excelled in that role.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"By the time we got to the Playoffs, even though he could handle more minutes, we just stayed with it, and really secure with that. I think he has embraced that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Our second unit now is one of our biggest strengths as a team. We were struggling with our second unit for various reasons for most of the season, and he kind of just fixed all that on his own."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's an art, not a science, right? There's no perfect formula to that. There's no perfect boom."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We know our group. They live on the razor's edge. There's an edginess to this group. The ""on"" button is usually on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think we've found better ways, more productive ways in the moments in between just to not exhale, not to relax, but just to recharge, get our minds off of that so that you can gear up the next day emotionally, physically, spiritually, all of those things. It's tough to always be on that ""on"" button."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This group has shown a maturity level to be able to handle both. We'll see tomorrow night. But in a moment like this, yeah, I want our guys relaxing. When we get out of here, I would love for them to get their minds off of it. I know how they all are. They want to be like that all the time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It could be different the next possession. It could be different within the possession. They're probably having similar discussions about our defense. This is that level. It's the Finals. That's what is required.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The guys have really been working diligently, film sessions and in these practices, to try to get on the same page. But they're a very good defense because of their changing coverages."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I don't want to be Nostradamus right now. We're taking it one day at a time. I know that sounds like cliche. He did the practice with the group. He is going to do a full-contact workout after this. We'll evaluate that. We'll meet with the training staff later on today and probably tomorrow, and we'll just continue this process."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He has not been cleared yet, so that's where we are. But we're encouraged by the work that he has been doing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He is a two-way basketball player. He does so many winning things that I think unfortunately when you view maybe a 56-point game, everybody on the outside views that he has to do that every game to impact winning. He understands the levers that contribute to winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He is doing it on both sides of the floor. He has an incredibly tough cover defensively that matters. Then offensively I still just think we have a great place where everybody feels settled. If your role players can step in and start playing great, it's usually because they feel a confidence level from the best players, and that's Jimmy and Bam. They infuse all of our guys to be aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The way they defend, they're prioritizing protecting the paint against him, so he has to make the right reads. Then down the stretch, those were his best moments. That's really key for us when you're in those close games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But whatever, however many points he had in the last six minutes, his fingerprints were all over the game down the stretch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, you know the term when you say your head has to be on a swivel? That's what it has to be. Your head almost has to be able to turn 360 degrees at all times on the weak side, and you can't physically do that, obviously."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That level of discipline and focus is the highest level. That's what he requires your defense to be. Then he can score. He's proven he can score 41 against us, and he scored 50 plus in another playoff game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"You're in the Finals. You're going to be dealing with great players, great teams. You have to find a way to overcome it and make it difficult and do a lot of things that are tough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, Murray is just an electric playoff performer. It's not just Jimmy. Jimmy will shape shift. He is going to be on a lot of different guys in this series. That's just the way it goes, and he embraces all of those challenges. He'll be on 1 through 5 at some point. Murray will draw second defenders, third defenders. You have to pick him up beyond the three-point line. He's ignitable, as we saw in that fourth quarter. He can do it a lot of different ways against a lot of different coverages."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,So you have to have some strong habits that you've developed over the course of the season.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, the combination of that and just how much attention he attracts makes him really hard to game plan for, and obviously a lot of us are beneficiaries of that, just with how unselfish he is out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"That's probably a better question for him than it is me. You know, I think there's probably some differences. I'm sure he would probably feel it more than we would. But you know, at the same time, regardless of what the coverage is, we expect him to be aggressive and put pressure on the rim and create opportunities for himself and others."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think first and foremost, being process driven, just trying to generate good shots and not being so caught up in the results of whether the ball goes in or not. If we move the ball, create advantages and play unselfishly and find others, then usually it bodes pretty well for us regardless if the ball goes in or not."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think we have proven throughout the playoffs that we can win in different ways. It's not just through making shots. Just that versatility, also, gives us some peace of mind in that sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,Similar to Game 1 in that we did some things that were encouraging but some things that we have to shore up. It's about being able to adjust and continue to improve throughout the series.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, you know, on that one in particular, just got the switch and then found like a little soft spot in the defense. So yeah, just try to be aggressive. Man, honestly that game, just trying to have my presence felt, particularly in the fourth quarter because until that point, I really had not had much of an impact. Just trying to be an offensive spark and provide a little bit of light."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think first and foremost, just belief in yourself and this group, and then also just with your preparation, putting the work in, knowing that you're prepared for opportunities, and you know, you can't always control if the shots go in or not but you can control how you prepare and get ready for the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Mentality is the same. I've seen a lot of defenders throughout my career. Jimmy is a good defender. Got great hands, anticipation. Obviously, he is a little taller than me. I'm not going to tell you how to beat it, but I've got my ways smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,Just got to keep him guessing and keep him working. Just because he is on me doesn't mean I can't be a part of the play or not put pressure on the defense. I thought I had some really good looks throughout the game just missed them. That's all I've got.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it helps a lot. Jeff took us to a team dinner last night at his house, all the way out in Narnia. But it was a good vibe just to have everybody there, forgetting about the last game, knowing that we're here as a team, as a family, trying to accomplish something. It means a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"A lot of it is mentality for me. I just like to keep the right mindset. So when everybody is in a good spirit, and even coming off a loss, I think that's huge. So shout-out to Jeff for getting that team activity together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"And everybody in film, I think Coach did a good job of making everybody speak up and give their own thoughts, and if we disagree, we can talk it out. I think it was a positive -- it's been a positive since the loss."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. Well, if you watch the first quarter, first three minutes of the first quarter last game, it was all our mistakes. If they go small-small, we didn't switch it and led to an open three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think it happened twice. They got two threes, and then I think Gabe hit a pull-up between me and KCP and we didn't switch. Those are all our mistakes. Those are all our doings."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"As bad as we played in the first quarter, we're down three at the end of it. As bad as we played to start the third, we were up by a little bit. It's just putting together 48 minutes. It has nothing to do with tightness."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"We're not playing well and we were still in control of the game, it felt like. We've just got to be able to put together 48 minutes and trust each other down the stretch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I mean, making shots is one. I thought my aggressiveness -- aggressiveness is not just shooting the ball. If I'm getting downhill and making the pass to another guy that is open, that is me being aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Some games call for different types of plays. I remember the Lakers series was up and down. Guys were running around, guys were flying off stops. Phoenix, both teams were running and gunning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"This series is more of an execution defensive game. We've got to stay spaced and stay organized and be more deliberate in our offense and in our defense, what we're trying to take away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's a team sport. It's not really about me. But I was aggressive in making my drives and making my reads off rebounds, pushing the ball in transition. So just picking my spots and not forcing. I thought I had some good looks that didn't go down."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"But like I said, we could have played a lot better. We could have played a lot better and got the job done. We just had some lapses that we had to come back from, and that didn't help us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Keep shooting. I'm going to keep running plays for him, especially during the the game so he can see one go in. We want him to keep shooting and play aggressive. Not just shoot the ball, but be aggressive. If it's not there, go to the rim. If the pass is open, pass it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,I think he'll be fine. Mike is a next-shot mentality kind of guy. I think he'll be fine. I'll find a way to get him going in Game 3.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"Probably just talking to my family, just realizing where we came from and how much work it took to get here. Just realizing the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"I'd probably say my family, my dad, all my friends back home, everybody supporting from my hometown especially, a small place called Kitchener. Just to take advantage of the opportunity -- that this is something personally I've been dreaming about as a kid. I will say that was the one that has resonated the most, and realizing the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"We've always been a resilient team. We've always had that. We've always had that chemistry. That's one of our biggest advantages is our chemistry and how long we've been playing together, the continuity that we have, the reads that we make on the fly, no matter what the defense is doing. I would say just as long as we stay together and have that bounce-back mentality, we'll be fine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JAMAL MURRAY,"We've been in positions like this before. This is the first loss in seven games, I think. So we're not doing a bad job. We've just got to refocus, sharpen our mentality and like I said, be more deliberate on both ends of the floor, and we'll be fine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"That he's just proud. He's proud of the way we've been playing, the way we've been sticking with it through the regular season. He's real positive, man. He's just proud of the way that we're playing right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, just like I said, just happy for me and happy how I've been sticking with it and proud of the progress I've been making."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"I talk to him here and there and I talk to him when I see him, but just want to play hard for a guy like that. So I appreciate everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"I am feeling better now. Definitely a lot better. I feel like I've almost got it out of my system, so definitely feeling a lot better than I did the last two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, man, just a couple of these meds and I'll be all right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Not much of a fever. It was more just like cold chills, body aches, heavy, heavy migraine. I was just laying down pretty much in the dark the whole entire game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Like I said, this is the time of year everybody is dealing with something, so nobody really cares what you're dealing with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I definitely can feel that. I can definitely feel it's that type of energy when I'm on the court. Just the attention of detail, that's what it takes to I feel like to get a championship at this time of year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Guys are honing in on everybody and doing whatever they can. That's on me to make adjustments and find ways to be effective, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"It feels great. Anywhere I can contribute, you know what I mean, and impact the game, I'm going to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Like I said, I might not have really been too effective offensively in the game, but at a time I needed to knock one down, I did it. This is definitely more of a series that they've got two of the best players and scorers in the league right now, so this is definitely a defensive series for me to lock in, and I'll take offense when I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Like you said, they've been preparing us for these type of moments, and just the leadership has been amazing. No matter how -- I think that's why we always feel like we have a great chance of winning these games, just because no matter how the game is going, they keep us mentally in check."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"It's hard not to listen to guys like that who's been there before. They've just been bringing great, positive energy, and we've just been feeding off that as a team, so it's been good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"Definitely do. Like I said, it's a sign of respect, and I appreciate it. Like I said, it's my job to make adjustments and find ways to be effective. That's the cool thing about the Playoffs, though, is you get different looks and it definitely challenges your IQ and your adjustments. It's pretty cool."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"It's a lot more strategic than it is the regular season, so it's a different type of game and this is the type of stuff you learn from, so I'm enjoying it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think that we just grind. We just try to get it done. Kind of got like our own different style. There's a lot of different guards from different places that like to be fast, that type of stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CALEB MARTIN,But I feel like we're kind of blue collar. We just try to get it done however we get it done. That's kind of what I take from it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Honesty isn't critical, so I don't view it as being critical. I think it was an honest assessment of the game. Before I came out and spoke to you guys, I had the same conversation with our players. Never once will I come into a press conference and say something to you that I haven't spoken to our team about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Our players owned it. I asked them after the game, Why did we lose tonight? And they told me we didn't play hard enough. They told me we weren't disciplined enough. It wasn't critical by any nature. It was an honest assessment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's not just one player right now. Whether it's Michael, Jamal, Aaron, Pope, Nikola, whoever, we have to be a lot more disciplined, a lot more urgent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you really want to simplify the first two games, in the first three quarters we have dominated both games. The Miami Heat are dominating the fourth quarter. They're averaging 33 points a game in the fourth quarter, shooting over 60 percent from the field in the fourth quarter and over 50 percent from three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,We're up eight going into the fourth quarter in Game 2. You're up 21 going into the fourth quarter of Game 1. They end up on a 15-2 run in the fourth quarter to take control of that game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think it's important to remind us that just because we're playing at home and we're undefeated, you just can't show up and think that's going to continue."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Coming off of a four-game sweep against the Lakers, and that was a very hard-fought sweep. They were in every game. We had to fight for every game. So you have to find a way to turn a negative into a positive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"We had a really good film session this morning. I gave an opportunity for everybody on our team to speak and talk about what they saw on the film. It was a very honest conversation. Guys owned what they needed to own. We have to learn from Game 2 to use it to our advantage, to your point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've got a great stat. I think quarters 1 through 3 after two games, we had around 19 percent of our possessions were at the end of the shot clock, last seven seconds."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the fourth quarter of Game 1 and 2, that jumps from 19 percent to 32 percent. Which means we're taking the ball out of the net, we're walking it up, we're playing against the zone and we're getting caught playing in really late-clock situations, which is hurting our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Obviously what I can do is to try to help our guys defensively, because when we get stops and we get out and run, we've had control of the first three quarters two games in a row. Making sure we have the right lineups in. And offensively, just kind of giving our guys as many ways that they can attack that zone as possible where we can be effective and at least produce the right shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whether we make it or not, that's going to be on our players. But trying to make sure we're producing the right shots against that zone, which has given us some trouble in the fourth quarter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"I showed 17 clips this morning. Every clip was a discipline clip, if you will, where our discipline, whether it was game plan, whether it was personnel, whether it was defending without fouling, whatever it may be, 17 clips added up to over 40 points in Game 2. That, to me, is staggering."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"I haven't seen indecision. I've seen, once again, a lack of communication and discipline. They played zone not just in the fourth quarter, and we've been fine against it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think once that game kind of -- you allow a 15-2 run to start that fourth quarter and you've got Nikola out, you've got to get Nikola right back in. Now it becomes a different ball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"We want to play fast they want to play slow. When you're not getting stops, advantage Miami Heat because now they have their 2-2-1 press back to the zone. And as I mentioned before, we're playing way too slow to try to attack that, which is forcing a lot of late-clock situations for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,MICHAEL MALONE,"We've got a lot of guys that have been in big games, playoff tested, so I don't think any of it is our guys getting tight. I think it's just not adhering to the discipline that the game needs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah. I think being at home in general, sleeping in your bed, being able to do things at home that you're comfortable with, you know, getting home-cooked meals, all that, that benefits it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But the benefit of the crowd is no matter what, they are going to be behind you. They are going to give you energy. You know, if the other team is on the run, they are going to give you a little boost, right. If you're on a run, there's going to be a crazy boost."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I think just the overall, you know, energy for your team and your group, it will give you a little bit of a lift, but it won't win you the game because you've still got to go out there and hoop."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But it will give you some type of, you know, good feeling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I will not tell you exactly what happened, but it was a great conversation. It was just making sure that I was healthy for an opportunity, if we got on a run like we've been and I think that's the biggest thing about it, is the opportunity to be healthy, to help the group, right, no matter what it is. And you know, making it into the Finals, I'm as healthy as I've been in a while and I feel good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,It was a great conversation. It was a great time. Felt fantastic. Having a guy like Pat having your back is a good feeling. It's a good guy to have back there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, I don't. I'm being honest with you, I don't. I mean, everybody knows the basic 2-3 and traps and all that stuff. I think you learn about the zone press first as a young kid, and then you learn about the zone defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But yes, if you're getting into the question of our zone, it's pretty cool."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"It works sometimes. It's shape shifting, and I think Gabe Vincent always will say, him and Andre Iguodala kind of figured it out how to play the top and give them credit. I think give them credit, and it's just been a work in progress."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,It's a different type of zone and you have to be able to play it and want to play it to make it successful.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I love the ""oohh,"" Seven Nation Army that chant, and the Swag Surf -- that one, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I think just we have a different vibe here, you know what I mean. The vibe down here is just awesome, and when it gets going here, it's really like a party. You have to enjoy it. You enjoy the music. They sing with you. They sing along. It's just a great place to be and the fan base is unbelievable, and I'm sure tomorrow is going to be nuts in here, and I'm looking forward to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"My first year, I didn't learn much. I was around the team but I got injured. And you know, I think the second year, just playing all 82 was huge for me, coming back from injury."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think the thing about longevity is figuring out how to adapt, take care of your body, understand what an NBA season is, understanding how to train in the offseason, understanding how to eat, understanding to get your rest and recovery. Being able to adjust to who you are and grow mature-wise, right, because at the end of the day, there's going to be times where you're going to be here, and then you're going to go up and then you're going to go up, and at this point in my career, there's a lot of people that just level off. You've got to be able to have the humility to be able to say, you've got to work at different things and be willing to accept different roles and different situations at different times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Right now, at this time of the year, I'm just happy to be able to have a guy like Gabe be the starting point guard, and playing the way he's playing and being able to talk to him and help him as much as I can. That's big for me, just being able to help him, and also being a guy that can see the game from different aspects to start the game off the bench and then give him my takes and come in there and do what I can do to help the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I think last year -- I mean, I've always done it my career, and I learned it from Jason Kidd, is always try to catch the ball, look ahead. It was something I learned from Jason Kidd, watching him a long time ago."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"As a guard, it's a lot easier to catch and throw right away. I think the components -- like for Kevin Love, he has an unbelievable knack for throwing the ball right to the guy and he's bigger and you know, just right on time. He's been doing it his whole career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it's just being able -- knowing that you have confidence in your guy to go get it. We are throwing the ball to Max and Jimmy. We know they are going to get it, you know what I mean, Bam. We know those guys are going to go get it and finish it, and having the ability to have athletes like that, it makes our job a lot easier on those outlet passes. For me, it's like, sometimes you throw it -- sometimes you throw it just to throw it. It might be a turnover but you get the guys, keep running, let's try to get some relief points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, I knock on wood before I go out there and other than that -- every game is different. Got to go out there and just figure it out, different music, different clothes, different shoes. Just go out there and figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, that's a lie. Steph Curry is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,All right. I'll take that one.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"Unbelievable, right. They got like a 19-handicap tour? Hes not a 19-handicap"
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"No, honestly, it's the way it should be, and I think that just shows how groups can get along. You kind of bring groups together that can be completely opposite and come together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,We have a team -- on our team we have guys who are complete opposite but we come together for one common goal and that's just the betterment of the game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KYLE LOWRY,"That was a great answer. Thanks a lot, you guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"I'm going to take the same route as we've done really the whole Playoffs. We have a belief system with this team that we can compete and win against anybody. You look down there, that's an incredibly talented team. They're big. They're physical. They pass the ball. They shoot the ball. They put you in a lot of tough positions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Like I said, our belief system is very high, and like Gabe said after the last game, we don't really care about the noise. Our position is we want to take care of business and go out there every game and compete and try to get ourselves a win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,Tomorrow we're looking to do that on our home floor.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Yeah, fifth time, definitely each and every playoff game in itself is different, but in the Finals it's such a battle of attrition, who can make the most plays, both offensively and defensively, but definitely getting here with a different team than Cleveland is different in itself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Playing in Denver, a different team that poses a ton of threats and is very well-coached, yeah, I think that every series, but certainly every Finals has posed different threats."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"This is who we are. Obviously when it's time to get down to business, our focus is all the way there during our prep, during our film session. When every coach is putting us through drills, going out there through a walk-through and obviously especially during the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,But when we're working we still like to have fun and keep it loose. It keeps us loose out there on the court starting the game and throughout 48 minutes. But it's not without intention and the willingness to do whatever it takes.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"It would be huge. He's another guy that provides so much shot making, play making ability. You saw in Game 1, we were a little bit cold from the three-point line, didn't shoot the ball particularly well from the field, so he's just one of those guys that provides so much firepower and can put a team on their heels."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"I think just being myself, unapologetically. I'm very grateful for them that they accepted me throughout the entire organization, just being myself, on the floor, off the floor. I think that helped me get acclimated."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"But also people that I've been around --I like to keep it light. I like to get to know my teammates on and off the floor personally but also professionally, see how I can best help them, uplift them and get the best out of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Everybody has their style of leadership, and getting a locker room right, I certainly have mine. But just want to be an extension of guys like UD, like Jimmy, like Bam, Kyle, players like that that provide so much not just on the floor but off."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"I've been on these guys the entire Playoffs, that good advice I got early on, kind of like we were talking about with the Finals is that every game is different, every game is going to pose its own set of problems."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"Sometimes it's going to be missing shots and trying to find ways to get stops on the defensive end to keep you in the game. Sometimes you're going to blow it out and catch fire, then have to deal with another team playing in transition. Those are just a myriad of options that you might see out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KEVIN LOVE,"But I think that these guys have been able to wipe the slate clean, certainly after every round, but after every game they've really been just pros the entire time, and the level of perseverance and bounce back has been at a very high level with this group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think just playing basketball. I think I don't have inspiration from other athletes or whatever. I admire them and respect them, but it's a different sport. It's really cool to meet them or whatever. But I don't have any inspiration from them, if that makes any sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know that other people are saying that. I'm just trying to play the game and reading the game. Other people talk about me like that. But for me, it's just a random basketball or whatever, reading the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, the fans are really coming to the games and bringing the flags and chanting my name and just talking to me in my language. I think that's really cool, just to see how many Serbians are in the world, and they're still coming and bringing the flag and cheering for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,I think that's really nice. It's nice to play in front of them. I think that is really cool.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"We need everybody, not just him. Yes, we need to do a better job of finding him or just getting him open. That's going to help us collectively, of course. But it's not just him. We need to, as a group, be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Just as a team, they know what they want to give up or whatever. They're really intelligent, from the coach to the players. That's why the zone is so effective, not just against us it's against the whole Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sometimes we get a good look, sometimes we don't. But I think that is even in regular man-to-man sometimes you get a good shot, sometimes you don't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"They are shooting against Milwaukee 43 percent. They are shooting against Boston 40-something percent. They have good shooters, and that's why they are so deadly and dangerous, because you cannot leave them open."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, the first game Max and Caleb didn't shoot well. But we know they're going to be better. We just need to don't give them wide-open looks. They are two great shooters that at least they need to see somebody in front of them, not just a basket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I didn't realize -- I mean, when you play the game you don't think about it. You're just trying to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But yes, definitely we need to get him going. And it's not just Jamal or Mike or me or whatever. It's collectively we need to find the open man. I think the open man wins the game. We need to be better as a unit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's communication, I think, was the main word. Just to don't get them wide-open looks. Yes, we know they're going to score. Yes, we know they have talented players. But we cannot give them open looks, and that was the main key."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, we're probably going to see tomorrow, are we going to respond well or not. That's the answer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I played a little as a kid, probably was like six or seven, five, something like that. I played 2-3, down the middle most the time. I was the tallest one. Pretty much so."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"It's a little more complicated for sure once you get in the NBA, those different levels but definitely a little bit applies the same, kind of guarding your area and just talking and communicating as well. That's a big part of zone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,Zone defense gives a different look. It's definitely helpful for us.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"He's a great player and he's going to make the right play, ten times out of ten. Denver's defense loads up and tries to attack the paint."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Jimmy and Bam have a good two-man action as well, so they did a good job of playing off each other and that. So Jimmy has always been a good passer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I mean, it's not really an answer to guard Jimmy. He's a superstar player. I think the Celtics, Boston was pretty much trying to do the same thing Denver is doing put a bigger body on him, good defender."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Jimmy is going to be Jimmy. Jimmy is a good player, so he's going to do what he's got to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"My mindset is to bring energy and impact winning, whether that's scoring, whether that's defending, rebounding, play-making, doing whatever I have to do to make the hustle plays. Just try to bring energy to the game and affect the scoreboard in a positive way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,It's a part of this game for a lot of good players. I've just got to be ready when I play. I'm always going to be ready.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think we just have to play harder, truth be told, play harder and be more disciplined, and I think that'll put us in a better spot to win the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I had some Nutella French toast, some good ol' eggs and cheese, and some bacon."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"That's private, man. I can't give out all my secrets. No, but today has been a great day. I'm here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"Man, leadership, great leadership qualities. I had him as a vet when I was in OKC, and obviously with his connection through UConn, we always had great stories to go back and forth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"With his leadership, his poise, his ability to communicate with people, it's amazing. I think he'll be a perfect fit, especially with the young guys that they have there now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think he'll be able to get to them, to have good conversation with them, to get them to do what's necessary for them to turn the corner on that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think people always try to say that coaching isn't equal, but it's basketball at the end of the day. But it's all about being able to communicate and have a relationship with your players, and obviously he's had great success in doing that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"I think at the end of the day it's about him making the tough shot, or when he is probing and trying to make a play for his teammates that we are aware of where his team is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"Jimmy is a threat, regardless where he's at, whether he has the ball or not. He's been playing amazing these Playoffs, and whenever he has the ball or doesn't, we have to be aware of where he's at because he's able to make plays in different ways."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"We let our guard down. Our defensive presence wasn't there, especially Game 2. We allowed them to get a groove. They found things that worked for them and we didn't adjust and we didn't make plays on the defensive end to get us out on offense to try to get us easy scores."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,"When the time comes. You know, lately we've had two days in between games, so that's been a time where I've just been able to get away from basketball, being around my family. I've had family come into town, my kids, my wife, and that's my opportunity to free the mind and relax a little bit and to just disengage from basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JEFF GREEN,That's been my way of recuperating the body and the mind from basketball and this long journey that we've been on.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"It's up there, man. It's top five. It gets rocking."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"I mean, you know, watching D-Wade go through his run. Watching Bronny and them go through their run. There was some iconic moments. Ray Ray Allen hitting a trey, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,Definitely feeling a little bit better. A little under the weather towards the end of that last game. Feeling better now.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"I'm extremely confident in this group of guys that have bounced back all year long. We do a good job correcting and making adjustments, and I'm excited to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, a lot of my friends from Orlando they are going to drive down and come to the game. That's nice. Florida almost feels like a second home to me. So, it's nice to be back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"No, I feel like we've had some breakdowns that are uncharacteristic of us. So, we went through film today and cleaned up some of those breakdowns, and I think it will be a different outcome."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"It's a really smart ballclub. They read the game very well. They have guys that can do a multitude of things. I mean, yeah, they make you play for an entire 24 and they make you play through 48 minutes a game. That's not usually -- that's not typical for an NBA team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"Just guarding, guarding through the entire shot clock and guarding through the entire game is going to be really important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"It's important. You've got to call a spade a spade. You've got to call it like you see it. It's the only way you're going to get better and only way you're going to make the necessary adjustments. It's about taking accountability, looking inward first and moving from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"I could have been better on defense. Not breaking down. Not letting -- you know, just sticking to the game plan a little bit better as far as like rejects or switching or low man or just the game plan discipline, knowing the personnel. Just where I can be better in that area and start there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I kiss my jersey. I kiss the front of my jersey, and the back of my jersey. I kiss -- I'm thankful for the organization and just thankful for my family as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I understand it, I would say. I wasn't pleased with Game 2 as well. The way we came out, energy and our effort, we can be a lot better. I know we can be a lot better. I've seen it, and like you say, it was different from Game 1 to Game 2. Game 1, our intensity was through the roof and in Game 2, it was nowhere to be found."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I understand where he was coming from.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We wasn't offended. As our coach, he sees on the court the effort we put out. So for me as players, I could feel that. Our effort and energy wasn't there Game 2, even though we lost by three. We didn't play at our best, and I know we can be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,We are always on the same page. We just had a little slippage in Game 2 where our miscommunication or our communication was bad. So we just got to be a little better in areas and be locked in.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I would say just be a little bit more aggressive, and I know they got the same amount of open shots they got Game 1 and Game 2, but Game 2, they knocked them down, so just -- I feel like be a little bit more aggressive and try to limit them threes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Not too concerned. Got to be solid. Stay in front of Jimmy. We know he's a great play-maker and great scorer. Just got to be solid and give him different looks and be aggressive. Just get the ball out of his hands, whatever it takes. Do my job for my team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"They have been the No. 1 three-point shooting team in the playoffs. They have got great shooters on their team. For us, we've just got to limit the shot attempts and try to not let them see the ball go in the basket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, Bam has been playing incredibly well this entire Playoffs, for sure this series, and that's when he's got like the toughest matchup by far on the defensive side of the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,He plays with so much energy. He never takes a possession or a play off. You've got to really respect him for that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Then on the offensive end, he is doing everything for us. We need him to continue to be that. He has been there for us all year long, and like I said, he is going to be the reason why we win the championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know, but I'm grateful for Tyler Junior College. Taught me a lot about the game of basketball. I had so much belief in myself. Not to say that I would be up here talking to y'all in the Finals, but I just knew I could be a really good basketball player, maybe make a little bit of money doing basketball overseas."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"They taught me a lot at Tyler Junior College about the game of basketball. And then, go to Marquette for three years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think JUCO just so happened to be like the best thing for me. I couldn't tell you that at the time. I was frustrated that I wasn't playing Division I basketball, but my goodness, I've got so much love for Tyler Junior College."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's always a blessing to play in the Finals, for sure, like in front of a heckling away crowd. But I'm so happy for the city of Miami, this organization. They deserve to be in the Finals. They deserve to win the Finals and win a championship. We will do everything in our power to make that happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I just know that the energy in there is going to be unmatched. It has been throughout this entire Playoffs run, and even in the regular season. I know they're going to show up. I know they're going to show out. I know we're going to do the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,I don't know. I don't have too many bad things to say about any organization or any player that I've played with. I know that the guys that we have here fit that mold to the T. Everything that they do here is about winning. It's not about anything else.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"So we ride with that. We think about that. Nobody really thinks about the past or where they have been, or the future where they might be. I think the best part about this squad, this time, is we're in it for right now, every single day, and that's what the Heat culture is about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, everybody, everybody that walks through this door or a part of this organization, past, present, for sure the future, you have to buy in to everything that we're about here, which is about one another, not about you, and about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If you can do that, you can handle all of that, you're going to flourish here. Each one of the guys on this roster, everybody in this organization, front office, all the way down the line, it's about somebody else, and it's always about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know. It's just winning basketball. We just happen to win, and it looks like we're playing good in the fourth quarter. I can't tell you the answer to that question. I wish that wasn't even a thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't know if anybody knows that except for you. We definitely don't know that. We just want to win. I'm telling you, we just want to win, and if it happens to be coming back in the fourth quarter, then that's what it is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If it happens to be holding a lead in the fourth quarter, I pray that that's what it is. At the end of the day, we've just got to find a way to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think I've done great. I think I've done what I've needed to do to get us to 1-1. I hope it was 2-0 in our favor it is not. I don't pay attention to stats. Not going to lie, I've said that all along. As long as we win, everybody is playing great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If we lose, and I hope we don't do that too often, everybody can blame me for whatever reason. I'm not worried about it. But nobody can blame anybody for anything whenever we win. That's all that we focus on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"He is one of the heads of the snake. I think it's a two-headed snake in this instance. Bam has a really tough job to do. I think time and time again, I have a tough job on Murray. He scores in so many different ways. He has the ball consistently and he is making all the right reads, all the right passes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"But it's just about effort, contesting every shot, body on body, making everything difficult for him. I've got to continually do that because I know if I lead the way on that end along with Bam, everybody has to follow suit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's all about doing your job, doing what is asked of you on any given night and hoping, praying that you did enough to get a win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, I think it changes from series to series, maybe even game to game. If my guys are open, I'm throwing it every single time. I hope I throw it on the money perfect to where you can just step in and shoot it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Like I've always said, I've got so much faith in them. I can't win without them. I've tried that before in other places where I just think I can do it. No, that's not the answer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"Here, we understand that I need those guys. I hope those guys need me a little bit, too. But it's like, it's perfect basketball. We love playing for and with one another. If you're open, I'm passing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. I'm not a scorer. Just because I score a lot of points one game, that doesn't make you a scorer. I'm not a volume shooter. I don't do any of that. I don't press to score. I only press to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"If I pass the ball every possession, if we win, I don't care. If I shoot the ball every possession and we win, I don't care. This Playoff Jimmy narrative is not a thing. I just want to win along with everybody else. I don't worry about too much other things aside from winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's always D-Wade just telling me to be myself and be who I am, create my own story and go out there and compete and do what you love to do, and that's win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,JIMMY BUTLER,"He's been in my corner for a very long time now. I'm very grateful. He is a huge reason why I'm here. I don't like to be compared to that guy, but the one thing that I do want to be like him is a champion. That's what I've got to go do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"I didn't come much. I came once when they played Philly in the playoffs. I think T.J., Tyler Johnson, was still here. But we also played here during the Hoop Hall. We played Princeton here my sophomore year. But I mean, I love this arena. It's a great arena."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"No, he never introduced me to them. But I did have a Heat meeting during the Draft Combine, but I don't remember much about it. But I think I did."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,No one yet but hopefully soon I get to see everyone.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,Definitely Coach L. I might go back to campus and see the new dorms. I was there last summer working out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,Am I surprised? No. Coach L. is a great coach. He gets great players to come in. They all buy into his system. They want to win. He gets winners to come in and play extremely hard. So not surprising.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"Each year, I think their goal is to win a National Championship. They have the players to do that. So, I can't wait till next year to start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"No, I don't think so."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BRUCE BROWN,"It means a lot. We were in Pinecrest yesterday at Jeff Green's house at a team dinner and we drove by UM. It just brought back memories, me going to the McDonald's across the street on U.S. 1 and being in the CVS a lot. It's great to be back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think we agree with what Coach said. You can't lose an NBA Finals game because of effort. We've got to bounce back effort-wise. I think we only lost the game by three points, so we're right there in a game where we didn't play well at all, and it's back-to-back games where I think the team agrees we haven't played well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,So we've just got to bounce back.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They did a lot of the same stuff, but we just messed up on our end, and I think that's the best part about it, is there's a lot of controllable things and a lot of things that we can fix."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"If it was something that they did that we just couldn't handle it would be a different story, but we lost by three in a game where we made a lot of mistakes on our end, so definitely controllable, and we'll bounce back in Game 3."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Lets Nikola score in the middle of the zone. If they want to mix it up, they're going to do what they do, but I think the biggest part is just controlling what we do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"And I think that's why we lost the last game. We didn't control what was controllable for us and we didn't play hard enough. Jamal can score on anybody, and our offense is good enough where anybody can get looks. And I think we got a lot of good looks the last game, they just didn't go in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think, like you said, we made a lot of mistakes on our end, and I think both games we felt like we haven't played that well, so we've just got to bounce back and do what we do really well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They had a lot of good and open shots in the fourth quarter, so got to take some of those away, and a lot of it's just communication."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, like I said, a lot of it is communication and stuff that we can control. Something that we will fix. We've been better with that stuff throughout the whole game. Like I said, back-to-back games we haven't played well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"To lose by only three in a game where we thought we didn't play very well, it's definitely encouraging, and we'll play a lot better next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think that might be something that we needed last game, to lose a close game with a lot of things that we can fix."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So we feel like we're definitely in the right spot, fixing things that we need to fix. We'll shoot better obviously going forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"But control what we can control, just be who we are. I don't think it matters home or away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"Best advice I've gotten? I think it was in the bubble. In the bubble, D-Wade called UD on FaceTime. I was in the room, obviously. He was like, hey, man, let me talk to young fella. He said the biggest things about the Finals is really embrace and cherish the moment because they do not come around often."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"It's not one of those things where you're like, all right, I'll just get here next year, because it's not that easy. Teams change, players change, coaches change. So really embrace that moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,I would say Duncan has definitely evolved into he can put the basketball on the floor now. He feels comfortable doing that. He feels comfortable making plays for other people.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"Obviously, he is one of the best shooters in the league when he ignites, when he gets on fire. It's hard to stop Duncan Robinson."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like the best thing about Kevin Love's passing is it's always on the money. They're always right there. Hands ready, it's in the pocket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"My biggest change would be on a team with K-Love, as you can see, as soon as he gets the rebound, I take off running. I feel like we've all benefited from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He's been to how many Finals at this point? So he has seen everything but the win. Him being in those moments, him cherishing those moments, I feel like he is comfortable here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He isn't making anything up. He isn't trying to figure it out, this, that and the third. He has been through so much with so many other great players that I feel like he settles in in these moments. This is when he really gets comfortable. This is when he doesn't really get really rattled. This is when he comes up with the game plan for us to be successful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"We both have something on the line, which is a championship. Obviously, it's going to be a fight. He is a great player. He is a two-time MVP, and you respect that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"You treat it like you're the only man in the arena. You take your time, inhale, exhale and then you go back to all them times you had to shoot free throws after running suicides, running 10s, being dog tired after practice having to make free throws. You just go back to those moments, and then it gives you that sort of confidence, like oh, I've been here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,You go to the line and knock them down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"I'm expecting it to be, every time we make a layup, free throw, there to be an avalanche of noise. And obviously when we get stops."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"For us, we've seen what this city looks like when it's been in the Finals. So it's good to have the opportunity to be back in front of these fans and have this opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He can go through two or three coverages and figure it out in a matter of, up and down, up and down. He's already read the game, reading the game. So the biggest thing for us is switching up the coverages and having him see different looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"The biggest thing for us guarding him is just make him take difficult shots. We're not just going to just let a man go get 40. That's just not smart by any means, especially when you're guarding a guy who has been the two-time MVP of this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"Biggest thing for us is force everybody on the team into tough shots, and you live with that result. Going into the intensity part, it's good to be in our environment. It's good to be in the 305 and have the crowd on our side."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"It doesn't. My thing in the pick-and-roll is to make sure that the guard gets open, so set a great screen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"He takes the challenge. Whatever the assignment is, I feel like he'll take the challenge. He's going to find a way to make it tough on him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,Biggest thing for us is having a guy like that that is willing to take the challenge on defense and also be the No. 1 option on offense.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,BAM ADEBAYO,"One, we have incredible experience on our team. We have veterans who have run 2-3, 3-2, 1-3-1, whatever that may be. And then also, we drill it to nausea, to the point where we're tired of it. But we also have that in our back pocket just in case we need it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I don't think so. I'd say no just because Jokic switches up what he does in pick-and-roll a lot. You know, they kind of keep you thinking, so I'm just trying to be aggressive and find my spots when I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"Duncan came in and was a huge spark for us. He's ignitable. We have a number of guys that are like that, but he does it in a special way. And, you know, when he starts cutting to the rim and finishing at the basket, it helps a lot, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think it was the result of 48 minutes of doing it. You know, we just had to work the game, and we'll continue to do so and just try to continue to play good basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"It's just part of our DNA, for one. You know, everyone on this team has battled through adversity in some manner and been knocked down and had to get back up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"And for number two, we have a lot of experience in these close games. So when it comes down to the wire, we are strangely comfortable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I think that everyone that's got a jersey on is willing to give in to whatever we need to try to help us get a win. I think that helps a lot, whether it's Kevin and Caleb or Max or Duncan or myself or Kyle. You go down the roster, and guys are just willing to give in, and I think that's huge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I think Spo said it well. It's hard to sum it up. Bam's been great. He's been relentless. He's got a tall task, obviously, matching up with Jokic, and we still rely on him and turn to him to do a number of things on us for both sides of the ball and he's been stepping up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"I think just in general, we just competed harder today. I don't know if it was any direct scheme or direct thing we did outside of just being a little more intentional and a little more focused and playing just a bit harder. Playing a little -- just competing a little bit more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"It definitely wasn't easy. The staff was great with me, whether it was film or getting in the gym, and my teammates have been phenomenal, coaching me up, telling me to be more aggressive when I'm questioning it or trying to think, should I pass first."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"And our stars, Jimmy, Kyle, Bam, they have just been in my ear and telling me just to play, play basketball. They trust my IQ of the game, and they want me just to go out there and play hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,GABE VINCENT,"It's going to be a different game entirely. I think every game will be different this series, especially, and it will be great to be back home to start with, be back in front of our fans, it will be an awesome environment, great experience. It's going to be a battle. They are going to bring everything they got and we'd better do the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I cannot confirm that, nor will I. I think that's Jared Greenberg and Charles Barkley coming up with this, but look, I'm still waiting to officially get word that Caleb and Gabe are going, although it'll take a lot to have them sit out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Then I'll just figure out my official lineup in the next hour or so.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I think it's okay to give you a little bit of that info."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yes, he is progressing. We're really encouraged by the progress. He started doing contact work as soon as we got to Denver."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have to maintain perspective. We want to be responsible about this. We're all excited and encouraged by his progress, but we'll get back to Miami. All we're doing is sticking to the process, trying to stack positive days, also understanding this is not trying to return to a game in December. This is the Finals. So, there is a little bit of context to this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I think I mentioned this the other day. When I grew up in the Portland Trail Blazer family, organizations were so much smaller, so it was the Adelman kids and the Spoelstras running around and there weren't a ton of other kids."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,He's probably had as much of an impact and inspiration for me to get into coaching as anybody. I had never even thought about it before that. I feel like I grew up in the Adelmans' household. R.J. and I were very close. All the kids were very close. Kathy and I went to college together. I knew David since he was super small.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But that was the first time that I saw what NBA coaching was all about, even though I grew up and Jack Ramsay was our coach. I was younger at that time, and then when you're a teenager, all you're thinking about is you want to play. You're not thinking about being an old crusty coach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I had every intention to play him in Game 1, and things just kind of went a bunch of different ways. Nothing seemed to look right, including my decision making."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But yes, he brings that veteran decorated playoff championship-level experience, and you can't really quantify what that means except for that he's been here, he can infuse a bunch of confidence in the guys, and he just has a timeliness of his winning plays. He's a tough competitor, and he's had some really important moments in this playoff run."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I guess that kind of sums it up, especially when you play on a team like this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I think that's the balance that everybody is trying to search for in the Playoffs. You start to face the better defenses in the league, in the Playoffs, and then you -- I feel like every team is trying to generate easier looks, so you get to a certain point in the series you're trying to find relief points in the open court, and you're weighing crashing the glass versus getting back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I guess we've faced some of the better running teams in the East so far, so we have kind of that urgency with that, but Denver is unique. They also do it in a little bit of a different way. We managed that okay in Game 1, but it's a big part of their game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Probably like any coach. We're masochistic, so yeah, it's not very unique to me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't totally remember. I think we were talking about some schematics. It was more about that. This is complex. Basically every other huddle we're talking about what it's going to require and all those extra efforts and physical plays without fouling, just making winning plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But I think at that time, we were talking about some schematics. That's a really good offensive team. They force you to have to compete at a super-high level, but you have to do it with a brain and you have to do it with discipline."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And our guys, regardless of how the head coach feels, during the fourth quarter, our guys love to compete. They love to put themselves out there in those moments of truth. Fortunately we were able to make a lot of big defensive plays down the stretch, and then we got a lot of contributions, which you're going to need against a team like this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Some of that run happened with J.B. on the bench. Their run in the second quarter happened with Jokic on the bench. Duncan's minutes were really good. Kyle just has this veteran championship experience that just kind of settles everybody, and he just makes the big, appropriate plays, our big plays at the appropriate times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And then Bam, we just can't say enough of how difficult his responsibilities are in this series. To take arguably the toughest cover in the league for all the myriad of reasons that I don't need to get into, and then he has to shoulder a big offensive role for us, as well. So it's not like he can just stand and rest on the offensive side, and yes, he has to play 40-plus minutes, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"More intentional. And that doesn't guarantee you anything either, but at least you give yourself the best chance. That the ball is going where it needs to go and everybody understands what we are trying to get accomplished. Then you have to trust. You have to trust each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So we did get some relief points on cuts and extra passes, ball movement that led to open shots. Yes, it always looks better if the ball goes in. But our guys are competitors. They love those kinds of moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Well, we've talked about it in all the previous three series, so I feel like I'm being redundant. We faced a lot of adversity during the season. We handled it the right way where you are not making excuses about it, the injuries, the changes lineups. Because of all that adversity and the 57 close games that happened, due to a lot of that, it hardened us. It steeled us and we developed some grit, which is what we all want."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We want to be able to have that privilege of having adversity and being able to overcome it. You gain strength from that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But this is a very tough opponent. They have our full respect, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Of course, everybody is going to be looking at that final number How many threes did he hit? But he's a winning basketball player. He does winning things defensively. He's physical, he's in the right spots, he's a great block-out guy. He's also a guy that will come in and help rebound. If you give him a task, he'll do it, and that's winning basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Offensively, yeah, it's always great to see the ball go in. But Max has also proven that he can impact winning regardless of whether the ball is going in. He puts in more time than he probably should. He's a masochist, like all of us. He's always going to put in the time. He's ignitable. And we needed every bit of what he did tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't even know how to answer that. It's not about me. This group, we have faced tough times this year. So we have learned how to handle setbacks, things not going our way and just getting to work instead of getting distracted or making excuses or feeling sorry for ourselves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It's like a muscle that you work on and you get better. We've had more experience at this than anybody else in the league. We've had a lot of crushing losses during the regular season.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we love Nnamdi. We really do. If you don't know that, the national media, because you're not following us, please look that up, Nnamdi. He's a special guy. He really is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He was with us in the bubble as a two-way guy. He took on I think the toughest role change for a young player. He was a gunslinger, 2-guard. We wanted to develop him into a combo guard, somebody that could organize us, be an irritant defensively, tough, learn how to facilitate and run a team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think that's the toughest thing to do in this league, is turn a 2 into a 1. He openly just embraced that. Then he struggled at times with that because you're trying to reinvent yourself. Instead of saying, This is too tough, let me be me, he's really grown the last three years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He's just an incredible winning player. This year, he's been a starter for us. He's been great. He's off the bench, he's been great. He's like a lot of our guys, the competitive spirit. You get challenged like we're getting challenged in this series, you hope it brings out the best in you. And that's what it's doing with him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Are you talking about Nnamdi, Gabe? I would say that old saying that we use a lot People severely overestimate what you can get accomplished in a day, and they grossly underestimate what you can get accomplished in a matter of months, years, when nobody is paying attention. And he's the epitome of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I wouldn't say that it was a lineup change. I get what you're saying. We just went back to our original lineup. We went with this lineup for 14 games. I didn't have the foresight, I didn't. That's on me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We had to make an adjustment in that Boston series, and that really was necessary and it worked. Then we're facing a new opponent that we don't really know, and so we just went with what finished that previous series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But we have been 10-4, 11-4 now with this lineup. Clearly we needed that size and veteran experience and physicality that K-Love brings. I don't know how many minutes -- I don't have my glasses, so I don't know the stats -- but that veteran experience, the dedicated championship-level experience that K-Love and Kyle both brought tonight, there's not an analytic that can show you how valuable that was."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, that's a ridiculous -- that's the untrained eye that says something like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This guy is an incredible player. You know, twice in two seasons he's been the best player on this planet. You can't just say, Oh, make him a scorer. That's not how they play. They have so many different actions that just get you compromised."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have to focus on what we do. We try to do things the hard way, and he requires you to do many things the hard way. He has our full respect."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I mean, Bam is the heart and soul of what we are doing at both ends. Sets the tone for us defensively with his versatility, and just making it difficult, usually on a team's best player, a lot of times, especially in this series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And then offensively, you know, he does a lot. Gets people open. A lot of stuff that doesn't show up in box scores screens, assists, all that sort of stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And also when he's aggressive, it's usually when we're at our best. He's been huge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, first off, just kind of having an approach and a disposition to not kind of just let them take me out of what we're trying to do. So that's a start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"And also, just kind of doing it with a brain, as well, and, you know, not just going out there mindlessly and just trying to run off a hand-off but instead being a little more patient, a little more thoughtful with it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,So was able to get open in large part because of good screens and good passing.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, nothing that really sticks out. We got a lot of belief as a group. And to be honest, we liked the flow of the game and how it was going. And the fact that it was -- we felt like at times we really had it on our terms and we're kind of making it difficult for them. You know, that's important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But we knew they were a really good team, and we just needed to come out with a sense of urgency in that fourth. It was kind of like a now or never sort of thing. Started with the defense, obviously, and we were able to do some things from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, just not always running to the ball. Just trying to be a little more creative. Something I've been working on for a little while now. It's a development thing. It's taken time to get to that point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But, you know, it makes it easier when you have got guys that can find you in those situations because the cut is one thing, but the pass is really what makes it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I had not done much in the first game and then the first half of this game, we talk a lot about trying not to have empty minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,So just trying to play with a certain level of aggressiveness on offense just to at least be out there and have my presence felt.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Obviously, it helps when the ball goes in, which you can't always control. But, you know, just really about taking the right shots and just being aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, for sure. You know, Max coming out like that was huge. And to be honest with you, we expected it. We know how great of a shooter he is. And, you know, when he came out and hit those shots early, I think it settled everyone a little bit. And from there, it's just about continuing to chip away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,So we've got a lot of belief in everybody that can step up and make shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,I surprised myself with the fact that I pulled that one out. That was not premeditated at all. That was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"To be honest, I don't get a lot of moments in the season to break that one out so when you get one, you've got to try to take advantage of it, I guess."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Mostly just try to play with a certain level of joy. I feel like I play my best when I'm having fun, and I'm always going to try to be respectful with it but having fun and enjoying just this stage. This is an incredible stage to be on as a player. That is when you dream about, so it doesn't make any sense to get here and not enjoy it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It's certainly gratifying. Gives you a newfound perspective and appreciation just for opportunity and this journey, understanding that you kind of go through stretches where you're going to have challenges and you're going to have to deal with adversity and overcome it. It's not always storybook in that sense and you don't always get when you want, and just kind of learning how to deal with that and push through that, I think obviously it makes moments like this more enjoyable but I think it also just makes you more grateful to have opportunities on this stage. Try not to take it for granted and yeah, you know, just go out there and enjoy myself and have fun and try to help this team win games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, he's a really good defender. Comes in and sets the tone with his speed and physicality."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"There's going to be adjustments both ways. As an offensive player, you have to adapt, and he's got to do the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"So just kind of continuing to learn and grow as you kind of gain experience throughout the series, but at the same time, always try to fall on the side of being aggressive and flying up at things and making shots because that's what my team needs me to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. They just played hard, and like I said, it was more discipline. It's defeating when you're giving up mistake after mistake, and it's not them beating you, you're giving them open dunks or open shots. That's tough to come back from. We've just got to stay together and look ahead."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, I don't think it has anything to do with that. It's defense and discipline. Like I said, we've just got to have an all-around game. We can't just have spurts of second quarter good, end of the third good. We can't have spurts of good play. We've got to play all the way through, through ups and downs, stay together and play with intensity and energy, and I don't think we had that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"We just piled them on, mistake after mistake, and weren't able to come back from that. Even when we were up, it felt like we were trying to climb back into the game just energy-wise and intensity-wise."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I mean, I think you guys have seen me hit that shot enough. It was a good look, just didn't go down."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"If we play like that, then we expect to lose like that, yeah. We can't play like that, so if we play away, home, on the road, doesn't matter. We've got to have a better showing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JAMAL MURRAY,"No. He had 41 points. He's doing a lot. Yeah, he played a great game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"We've talked about knowing he's going to come back at some point in this series. Hasn't played since Game 1 of that Milwaukee series. He's been out for a while. We know what kind of talent he is. His ability to play off the bounce, create for himself, create for his teammates and obviously shoot the three ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"If and when he becomes available, our guys will be ready, from a personnel standpoint and a game plan standpoint. We understand this is Game 2, he is out and we're going to see a much different Miami Heat team than we did on Thursday night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, if we give them as many open threes, maybe. That's the thing no one is talking about. They didn't get to the foul line a lot, and we gave them a ton of open looks from three."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, I'm not banking on the Miami Heat getting two free-throw attempts tonight. We knew that without hearing anything they said, but then you listen to their comments yesterday, and whether it was Jimmy or anybody else on their roster, they know they're going to have to play more aggressive, attacking the basket, putting pressure on the rim."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's why your attention to detail and your KYP Know Your Personnel discipline come into play. You've got to stay down on shot fakes. You've got to show your hands and try to limit that. Because when they get to the foul line, that's when they control the tempo and can implement their defensive game plan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, eight years is a long time. You look at the steady improvements on that end of the floor, and this year I think with about maybe three weeks to go in the season, we were right on the edge of top 10, and then we did not finish the regular season off very well and we dropped down to 15. But I knew full well that when we were locked in, this team could step up and defend at a high level. I believe we finished third in the regular season in clutch defensive rating. So when the game was on the line, they proved night in and night out they could go out and get timely stops in close games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Very proud of the buy-in, the commitment. When you add guys like KCP, a guy like Bruce Brown and then guys like Michael, Nikola and Jamal just continuing to evolve and improve on that end, and then you've got a guy like Aaron Gordon, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"The guys understood for us to win a championship this year, we'd have to make improvements on defense. I think in these Playoffs, we've done that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think -- and you know this because you've been with us the whole year -- I feel really, really fortunate to have veterans like Ish, like DeAndre, Jeff and KCP, guys that have been around the block a few times. When you can have veterans that are truly selfless and not worried about hey, I'm not in the playoff rotation, but they're still invested in the team and the team's success and they're willing to use their voice in a positive manner, that is really impactful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Ish has always great things to say. He has the respect of our locker room, as do all the other veterans I mentioned. They've had an impact. Even without playing many minutes in these Playoffs, they have had a real impact on our team, our culture and the locker room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, you look back to his rookie year, he's always been kind of a lighthearted, funny -- I think as the years have gone on, he's definitely matured, grown up. I'm sure being a father, being a husband has helped that. Not that he was immature. I'm not saying he was just goofing off all the time. But he has a great personality. He doesn't take himself too serious."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Going on the road up 2-0, you know that you've maintained your home-court advantage and you're going into the opposing team's arena with a 2-0 lead, and the pressure squarely on them as you go on the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But for us, we're just worried about tonight. We're not worried about going down to Miami, Game 3, Game 4. This is truly a one game, one quarter at a time mindset. We've done a great job at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But once again, I don't think we played great in Game 1. They didn't play great in Game 1. I expect both teams to play a hell of a lot better tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think you have to mix it up. This time of the year, we can't give them a steady diet of one thing. I think we have to read flow of the game, time and score. You have to read personnel, who is involved in the pick-and-roll with Bam, and then give them different looks. We gave up four pull-up threes in Game 1, three to Kyle Lowry, one to Gabe Vincent. Bam in the pocket is not only a lethal scorer in that mid-range, but he's also a very good playmaker. You have guys like Jimmy Butler and Haywood Highsmith cutting behind the defense, what we would call a ghost cut, and really putting a lot of pressure on the rim and your low man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's definitely a challenge. But as long as we're contesting all those shots and adhering to the game plan with discipline, hopefully the results will be in our favor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I'm getting it from my assistant coaches. I'm not sitting there reading the ticker. But we meet a lot, we talk a lot. When an opposing team only has two free throw attempts as a team and Jimmy Butler, who was third in the Playoffs coming into this series at 9.1 per game and he gets zero, it's just common sense that they're going to be a hell of a lot more aggressive, understanding that they have to get there more than two times a game, because that's who they've been. I think Game 1 obviously was not who we've seen from the Miami Heat throughout these Eastern Conference Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's one thing, without hearing them, we knew already that they were going to be a lot more aggressive because that's what every team tends to do in these Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I don't think that's the biggest question."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Let's talk about effort. This is NBA Finals, we are talking about effort that's a huge concern of mine. You guys probably thought I was just making up some storyline after Game 1 when I said we didn't play well. We didn't play well. Tonight, the starting lineup to start the game, it was 10-2 Miami. Start of the third quarter, they scored 11 points in two minutes and 10 seconds. We had guys out there that were just whether feeling sorry for themselves for not making shots or thinking they can just turn it on or off, this is not the preseason, this is not the regular season. This is the NBA Finals. That to me is really, really perplexing, disappointing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I asked the team, I asked them, you guys tell me why they lost, and they knew the answer. Miami came in here and outworked us, and we were by far our least disciplined game of these 16 or 17 playoff games, whatever it is now. So many breakdowns. They exploited every one of our breakdowns and scored. If we're going to try to go down there and regain control of this series and get home-court advantage back, we're going to have to outwork Miami, which we didn't do tonight, and our discipline is going to have to be off the charts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Oh, there's no maybe. There was miscommunication, game-plan breakdowns, personnel breakdowns. There were guys like Max Strus -- I said it after Game 1, he's 0-for-9 in Game 1, you know he's going to make shots. He got off to a really hot start tonight. Cooled down a little bit. He gets 10 threes off, Gabe Vincent six off, Kevin Love gets six off, Duncan Robinson three off. Those are guys that we are supposed to have a heightened awareness to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"As I mentioned after Game 1, the fact that they got 16 wide-open threes was concerning. They didn't make them. So, we got lucky in Game 1. Tonight, they made them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"So, it was definitely a breakdown in communication. It was definitely a breakdown in our game plan, and like I said, we just were not nearly as disciplined as you need to be in the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I'd have to watch the film. Give them credit, they played with tremendous pace, and they never let up. So, we've got to make sure we're doing a better job of getting our energy up and not letting them outwork us and create separation and kind of put us in a spin cycle, which they did quite a few times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Fourth quarter defense, I thought for three quarters tonight actually the defense was pretty good. I believe going into the fourth quarter they were shooting 43 percent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But in the fourth quarter, you give up 36 points on 69 percent from the field. That's not going to cut it. That's not going to cut it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"I thought the way Nikola closed that third quarter was tremendous. Kind of got us a little bit of rhythm going into that fourth quarter, gave us a little bit of breathing room and then they started the fourth quarter 13-2. To me the wheels really fell off to start that fourth quarter. They were getting whatever they wanted, threes, layups, and that allowed them once again to sit back in their zone offense, slow the game down, and we had a hard time getting stops, and then we had a hard time getting made baskets on the other end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Our defense has to be a hell of a lot better. That's two fourth quarters, Game 1 and Game 2, where our fourth-quarter defense has been nonexistent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, you have to understand who you're guarding, KYP know your personnel discipline. So, if you're guarding a Duncan Robinson, a Gabe Vincent, a Kevin Love, a Max Strus, you have to guard them at the four-point line. I believe, talking about lack of discipline, I think we fouled at least three jump shooters tonight, then you have to have the discipline to contest without fouling -- getting a hand up, giving them a place to land, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Jamal had a great look at the end. I told our guys, if we would have won this game tonight, we would have stole one, and it didn't happen. The shot didn't go in, and we lose by three points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, the three-point line is a huge concern coming in, the No. 1 three-point shooting team in these Playoffs and did a decent job in Game 1 by the numbers, but tonight they buried us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one, I think the altitude, too much is made of that. I think -- Miami has been here for probably like a week now, so they're acclimated. So, I really don't think that's the reason why we've won games at home. I think our players deserve credit. Our fans deserve credit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"But yeah, they came out in that fourth quarter with a huge sense of desperation, and we didn't match that. Once again, 13-2 start, they kind of take control of the game, and just our inability or unwillingness to get stops and have a defensive mindset in the fourth quarter was very problematic. Again, the numbers speak for themselves -- 36 points in the fourth quarter on 69 percent is going to make it really hard to win a game in the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think it's dependent upon the situation. Their half-court defense was giving us a lot of trouble in that fourth quarter, and you take a timeout, you let them get set, you let them review whatever play they think we're going to run, and there's a great chance that we don't get a quality shot like Jamal got, which was on line, and from my perspective, looked like it had a great chance of going in, and we've seen Jamal make shots like that before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Some nights, yeah, we can take the timeout. Other nights give our guys the freedom to get out and run. But with how well they were guarding in that fourth quarter and how hard it was for us to generate great looks, I felt in that transition we were going to have the best chance to get the look that we wanted."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, probably a combination. We have to give them credit. We scored 108 points, 52 percent from the field, 14 turnovers for 19 points. That's a concern in the fourth quarter, 4-for-10. But I trust Nikola. He's going to read the game. He's going to read how he's being guarded, and he's also going to pick his spots where he knows regardless of how he's being guarded, we need him to score and be aggressive and look to score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whether it's 41 points, only four assists, or it's 25 points and 15 assists, Nikola, one thing I trust about him is he's going to make the right read time and time again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"Yeah, we felt like last game obviously was a tough shooting night for us. Guys that typically at the very least hit a few more shots, it just wasnt here for us in Game 1. I love seeing Max, Gabe, Duncan and Caleb, all of those guys stepping up and shooting the ball with confidence. It was a beautiful thing to see. Getting off to that hot start and consistent, fluid start for us was great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"Its going to be a hard-fought series. They say the series starts when an away team wins, and now it becomes a best-of-five. But now we get to go back home with the series split. So we can tip our hats to that and feel good about that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"I love it, man. He can be one of those guys who just breaks a game open. Weve seen that from him throughout these playoffs. His consistency and confidence has been there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,Its so hard to game-plan for him. Hes such basketball savant. Hes brilliant out there. Youre never going to stop him you just try to slow him down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"If you take some of the passes away, hes going to go score. You try to take that away and send a double team, hes going to pass the ball. Hes going to bury you under the hoop if you switch. Hes just so smart that, you just try to make it tough on him and take the other X factors out of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,Slow Murray down as well. They get to that pick-and-roll that is so devastating. Probably the most devastating one-two punch in the league. Thats why theyre here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"We know were going to have our hands full for the rest of the series. At least for tonight, getting that win was huge for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"Hes a huge factor. Michael Malone is a hell of a coach too. But Coach Spo, having been here and having a storied and decorated career, its a beautiful thing to have him on that sideline."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,KEVIN LOVE,"That trust works both ways with us. Its a beautiful thing. You look over there during timeouts, halftime, pregame, prep, all that stuff is a ten out of ten with our coaching staff and Coach Spo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, yes, of course that cannot be a question. But we just didn't play well, the right way in the fourth quarter. They scored 36 points in the fourth quarter. That's too much, of course. They got a couple of rebounds. It was just -- happened to be like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we didn't want it to happen, of course, but it happened, so we're going to live with it. We are going to Miami to play another game, so..."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't think about assists or whatever. To be honest, I don't know the answer. I was just playing, and I don't think when I'm playing about stats or whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, just you need to know what to do. We had a lot of miscommunication and misunderstanding. They were getting open looks, especially at the beginning of the game, and we have a couple at the end of the game, too. You just need to know where to be or what to do or what's the coverage or whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"The first game, I think we had -- I said I missed mid-range shot, Jamal missed mid-range shot and Mike missed a corner three. I think those are shots that we want and we didn't make those, and today they just put us in their rhythm, and we didn't want to play that way, and they want to, obviously. But maybe just to play a little bit faster is going to help us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Of course, they have a really good team and really good players, and we need to adjust, so it depends of the skill set of the player. Sometimes we are up, sometimes we are down the floor. I think everybody is doing that in the league. We just need to be there early and then make an extra effort, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, just a good stretch, of course. Seems like I just got going and I was just trying to score. Simple as that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course they scored 17 threes, they shoot 48 percent, which is really, really good, of course. Just I think be disciplined, just if somebody is running, run him off -- I think the discipline is the key for us. If you are not disciplined, if we're going to have a breakdown, it's not going to be a long series, of course. Just because they are punishing you as soon as you make mistakes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,Hopefully we're going to be disciplined for next game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,I don't -- can I not answer this question? Next question.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we know that that's not going to happen. Of course, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, and especially in the Playoffs where every game is different, every game matters, which is normal. We didn't want to lose, but we lost. So hopefully we're going to go there and win the next one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"Yeah. It's the expletive Finals, man. Our energy has to be better. We can't come out like we did, and we have to be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"I think it's all about discipline. We just have to be better disciplined on the ball, off the ball, knowing our coverages, knowing what we're supposed to do, playing without fouling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"Nothing needs to be said at this point. I think we understand, especially after tonight, how we need to be. Like I said, it's the Finals. I don't think we need a rah-rah speech in order to get us up. I think we know what we have to do going into Game 3."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"No. I think he did what he was supposed to do. When he had to be aggressive, he was aggressive. He makes the right play, and he sees the floor very well. I don't think what they did took him out of him getting assists."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"If he's going to be aggressive like that, other guys can figure out how to be effective on the court. It's not about us just waiting around trying to get Joker to figure out how to get us the ball. We have to figure out how to be aggressive. It starts with the defensive end and then we carry that over to the offensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"They made shots. We didn't turn them over like we did in that first stretch, and that was the tale of those two halves. We didn't get the stops that we did. We didn't put the pressure on them. We wasn't aggressive enough on the defensive end, and we allowed them to get a groove, and that carried on to the fourth quarter, and that's how they got the win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"No, I think it's the defense that impacted the offense. We allowed them to get comfortable, easy looks. Like I said, our discipline wasn't as great. Fouling jump shooters, allowing easy cuts. We wasn't ourselves tonight. Our communication has to be way better going into Game 3, and I think that was the reason they got into the lead."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JEFF GREEN,"Well, I mean, we've won on the road before. I think we understand what's at stake. They did what they were supposed to do. They came in here, got a split. Now they're going home, and I think we have to go in there worried about Game 3. We can't worry about Game 4. We have to worry about Game 3. We know we have to be better defensively. Our energy has to be better, and then get that win when we play Wednesday."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, we love all of our fans, especially Argentina. You got some great basketball players coming out of there. I love the country as a whole. I love football. That's probably my favorite sport."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"But like I said, we take our fans if we can get them over here in Miami, and we have a lot of love for everybody that supports us around the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think he got off a decently good look. Kind of like a high pick-and-roll isolation, and I just contested it. Pretty glad that he missed it to give us a 1-1 series tie going back to Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I just think nobody cares on our team. We're not worried about what anybody thinks. We're so focused in on what we do well and who we are as a group that at the end of the day, that's what we fall back on. Make-or-miss shots, we're going to be who we are because we're not worried about anybody else. That's how it's been all year long, and that's not going to change."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"So that's what I think it is. I think it's the ""I don't give a damn"" factor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"Some ball pressure. Getting back. Getting our hands on loose balls and just challenging every pass, every shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I mean, he's a hell of a player. He passes the ball so incredibly well. Obviously he can score the ball like he did tonight. But when you get the opportunity to turn the ball over and get out into the open floor, I feel as though we have to do that, and we did a decent job of that today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's just part of the game. A lot of the teams in this league, and that's definitely them, they have some big time shot makers. Like I said, we are going to stay with it. We know what we're capable of, get some stops, we can make some shots as well, and got the opportunity to turn the game around and get one on the road."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think there's a secret sauce to it. I think we just move the ball, pass the ball to the open guy and play some simple basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"A lot like they do, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"And we made shots. That's what this league is, that's what this game is, make-or-miss game, make-or-miss league. We made some shots they didn't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"I see it every day. We talk about it so I know how comfortable he is. I know the level of confidence that we have in him and that he has in himself to go out there and run the offense at any point in time, first through fourth quarter, maybe even overtime."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"And we live with the decisions and the shots that he makes and takes, and he's our starting PG for a reason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. Keep playing basketball as far as I can. Making plays for others. Score whenever I get the opportunity to do so. And through all else, just find a way to win. I think we did that tonight as a group, and we'll continue to do that as a group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,We just didnt play hard enough from the jump. They played really well. Thats how they win games they punch people in the mouth early and out-tough you. They did that and we got to bounce back.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, yeah. Theres going to be tough games, and like I said, they just outplayed us. They came out and hit shots when they needed to hit shots and had a really good start. We got to bounce back next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You dont lose an NBA Finals game because of effort, and thats what we did. We know what we got to fix, and it might be the punch in the mouth we need."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,Just got to bounce back.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,Its a series for a reason. You dont lose on one game. You have to come back the next game and perform better. We messed up some switches and we messed up a lot of things that are controllable. We know that thats not who we are and well get it back next game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,THE MODERATOR,"I'd first like to introduce David Fogel, National Basketball Coaches Association Executive Director and General Counsel. Also joining us is Rick Carlisle, Indiana Pacers head coach and National Basketball Coaches Association president. I'll turn it over to David."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"Thank you, Mark. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are excited to be in Denver for Game 2 of the NBA Finals, and to present the 2023 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and all of our head and assistant coaches, I'd like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, John Hareas, Mike Levine, Mark Broussard and so many people at the NBA, and for all the league support and assistance in providing this tremendous platform for our great coaches."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"We are especially proud of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who over the years set the standard for integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion of NBA basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"Chuck was an incredible mentor to so many coaches and players in our league, including Coach Carlisle and Coach Adelman. With that, I'd like to turn it over to NBA Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and Coach Adelman. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Coach Carlisle."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"Thanks, David. Adam, thank you. I see Byron Spruell in the back. Hi, Mark. Appreciate you guys. Also want to mention that Rick's daughter Kathy Adelman is here, and a lot of things are kind of coming together tonight. Rick's son David is one of the coaches for the Nuggets. Kathy, who is from Portland, went to the University of Portland concurrent with Erik Spoelstra, and they were both point guards on the men's and women's teams. They know each other well. So there's a lot going on here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"Before I announce our committee members that vote on this award -- one of them is Joe Dumars, who is here, appreciate you being here, Joe -- I want to also announce another award that we normally wait until Summer League but thought it was appropriate tonight, given the fact that his son is also coaching. So the Tex Winter Lifetime Impact Award for assistant coaches was voted on about 10 days ago and was awarded to Brendan Malone. Let's give him a hand. Applause."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"This is a night that is a very special night. We're going to announce two awards, which we rarely do. Our committee, I mentioned that Joe Dumars is on it. Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley, who is in the building, Bernie Bickerstaff, Billy Cunningham, Donnie Walsh, Phil Jackson and Lenny Wilkins. Our past winners Tom Heinsohn, Jack Ramsay, Tex Winter, Pat Riley, Bill Fitch, Bernie Bickerstaff, Dick Motta, K.C. Jones, Jerry Sloan, Al Attles, Hubie Brown, Doug Moe, Frank Layden, Del Harris, Larry Brown, last year of course was Mike Fratello."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK CARLISLE,"Rick Adelman is a guy that guys in my generation watched very closely. When I became a first-time assistant coach in this league, I was out scouting a lot. Back in that era, there was a lot of play calling. You were constantly getting calls and writing things down and drawing diagrams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I learned this from Joe Biden. He talked with cards out here, so I brought mine."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I was listening to Rick talk about the teams I had. I have this speech here, but I'm not going to really do it. It was amazing groups that I had. Anybody who coached in the NBA knows that you have a great chance of success when you have really good players. I mean, it's a players' league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But I also learned that you have to have good players and good people, people that will listen to you and will do what you want. I'm just honored to have this award. I think back to a good friend of mine who is not here, Michael Goldberg, who was a very good friend of mine, and really miss him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"It is amazing that it's here in Denver. When the thing was going, I thought, well, we're going to have to fly to Boston. Then all of a sudden Miami wins. So now you've got my son David here as a first assistant. Ish Smith is on the team, who I coached. Daniel Shimensky is a trainer here, and my trainer was Mike Shimensky. Then Erik Spoelstra, of course, hung out at our house all the time and played basketball on our sport court and did all that stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"And then Kyle Lowry, Kevin Love. Robert Pimental is an equipment guy. Forgot about Robert, but it's just like, holy criminy, something happened right. And with Brendan Malone getting that award, I told David, you've got to win it. If you can't win it now with us two getting this award, I don't know how you're going to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I think of Chuck, and it brings back bad memories seeing Joe here laughter, because it was 1990 when we played Detroit in the Finals, my first year coaching. My third year, we got to play Chicago."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"After that, I thought, this is easy. You get to the Finals every two or three years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But we played Detroit, and one thing I admired about Chuck after that series was over is he played to his strengths of his players. I mean, we had to face those three guards they had, Joe, Isiah and then Vinnie Johnson, and they just killed us. They just killed us. I never thought anybody would beat that Portland team three games in a row in Portland, and they did it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"That's where I remember Chuck, how he used the strengths of his team, of his players, to get the best out of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I tried to do that. I think Rick said it best. When I had Portland, who had three of the best offensive rebounders in the league on that team, and they would throw it up there and just go get it back. There wasn't much we could do but just rebound the ball. Great team, great guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Then in Sacramento we had a totally different team. It was a team that passed the ball, cut, shot it well. But again, I got real smart because I put Vlade and Chris Webber at the elbows and let them be our point guard, and that worked. It really worked with that team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Then, of course, when you go coach Yao, you don't screw around with Yao. You put him at the low post. You put him where he can be successful. What a great guy he was to coach. One of the worst things I had to me coaching in this league was when Yao got hurt. It just broke me up because he was such a great player. We had Yao get hurt, Tracy McGrady get hurt and that had just ruined that team. It was a great team, because as you said, 22 wins in a row. I forgot about that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"It's good I get back to these awards because it brings back memories of things. That's what happened with the Hall of Fame, too. It brought back so many memories. At the Hall of Fame, I had eight players come back. I had seven coaches, assistant coaches, come back. That really means something to you when you see all those people again. Here I am with Kevin and Kyle on the other team and a couple other players are here. It really means a lot to me when I think back on it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,It validates what you did.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I know I'm not supposed to do this, but when you're a head coach, and Rick will tell you this, you have people around you who help you. They're part of the reason you get there. I had an owner in Paul Allen who gave me my first job. Out of nowhere, he gave me a chance. I really appreciated that. We got to the Finals my first year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I had assistant coaches that were just great. I'm going to name them, whether people like it or not. John Wetzel was with me for 14 years, I think. Elston Turner, T.R. Dunn, Pete Carril, Bubba Burrage, Terry Porter, Jack Sikma. Pretty good names on this list. Then my two sons, David and R.J., were assistant coaches with me, and Bill Bayno. Great group of guys. That's how you win. You have people around you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"The training staff -- it's just something you think about when you get an award like this. In fact, I see in the back, I think I see -- is LJ back there and Lennan? I got two grandkids here, LJ Adelman and Lennan Adelman, and their mother, David's wife Jenny."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,It's good to see them here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Anyway, I also think the thing you have to do when you're in this league, and anybody who coaches in this league and has been married, you know that your family is so important. Your family is everything to you. They're the ones who stand by you. They're there when you get home. It's long seasons."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,I had a great family. I have 12 grandkids now. Good thing about them is you can spoil them and send them back home.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But the thing I had, too, is I had a rock in our family, my wife Mary Kay, who couldn't be here today, but she was a big reason why you get an award like this. ""Lifetime achievement"" means you have someone special with you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"That's about all I have to say. I'll throw away these cards, and we'll go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"You know, it means a lot. Seeing people that you really care about succeed. I brought my son David in as a developmental coach. I wasn't sure that was really a smart thing for me to do, to get him involved. But he's worked his way all the way up to first assistant, and he's done it on his own. So it's really a pleasure to see that for me. For a father and a coach, it means a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Watching Erik, the way he's grown. Pat took a great chance to give him the job, and he's proven himself, too. You see the ex-players that you've had, that means a lot. When you see guys like Kyle and Kevin, you just think back to all the good times you've had."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I think that's probably the biggest part these awards do, is they give you a chance to see everything. Hall of Fame, my whole family got to go there. I owe all those people. So that's special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,That's a very loose statement.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I learned a lot because I was fortunate, I had my first coach was Jack McMahon, who's no longer with us. He gave me a chance. Pat says I made the team in Portland when he was there because they liked me better, and I said, well, that's probably true."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But I think you learn from -- I had Jack McMahon, I had Dick Motta, Phil Johnson was one of my coaches. I had a lot of coaches who were -- Butch van Breda Kolff was one of my coaches. I was around a lot, and I learned from them. I learned what to do. I started the first couple years. I came off the bench after that, and I just learned what you had to do to be an important part of the team, whether you played or whether you didn't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,I learned that -- then I had six years of junior college at Chemeketa Community College in Salem. It's a hard word to pronounce. It took me a while. But we had great success there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Little did I know that Jack Ramsay was actually following my team at Chemeketa, and when Jimmy Lynam left he called me and asked me if I wanted to interview. I did, and he gave me my first break as assistant coach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,Jack was a unique individual and a great coach.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Well, I watched him coach in high school. He had great success in high school, and his teams were fun to watch play. He had a really good feel of how to coach guys. I watched him work guys out in high school, and the reason I hesitated is because I didn't know how long I was going to be in Minnesota. I really didn't know. I didn't want to pull him all the way from Portland to Minnesota and not have a chance to stay there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But to his credit, after I left, he stayed with Flip Saunders and he stayed with Sam Mitchell and he worked his way into it and worked his way up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,But you never know. It's not like the coaching ranks are really solid right now. Few guys have gotten fired who have been pretty good. You just never know. You've got to get lucky.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I was very lucky. I was 13 years in Portland as an assistant and head coach and I was eight years in Sacramento, four years in Houston. It doesn't happen very often that you get to stay in one place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,That's why I was hesitant. But I just thought he had all the knack and the wherewithal to do the job.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Well, I think what you have to do is when you're a coach, you have to probably put guys in position where they can succeed, and I tried to do that with both of those guys. Kyle, he was a tough little sucker, I'll tell you what, but we got him. I had Aaron Brooks at the time, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But Kyle just kept growing and growing. One thing I remember about Kyle, we played them in exhibition when -- I forgot who he was with. Memphis, that's right. He got a triple-double against us in preseason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"So when they brought in -- maybe we should go after him. I said, go for it, that's great. But he worked his tail off, and he was very -- to me, he was very receptive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Kevin, it was just a no-brainer. I mean, he was a great rebounder, a great three-point shooter. He could post up. I took advantage of his three-point shot because he could do that and he could spread the floor. We had another guy Nikola Pekovic who was our center, who was strong and physical, and Kevin was a perfect fit for him, and Kevin could pass."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,I had watched Kevin in high school. He played with my other son in high school. So I saw what kind of talent he was.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"One thing I learned, too, that I didn't coach then, but I watched a high school team, and their coach wanted me to come in and put our corner offense in. So I did it, but after practice I said, this is not a -- this is stupid. You've got Kevin Love, you need to post him up. You don't want him at the elbow area."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"But when I got to Minnesota, it seemed smart to post him up and put him there, and he did it all. He had all the talent in the world. Both those guys, you put them in a situation, see if they succeed, and then you go for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,Usually guys don't disappoint you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I see it. I see it, especially because I watched every Denver game, and Jokic is Jokic. He is so good. You watched him play, and it's fun to watch that type of game be played."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I have a brother who coaches in junior college, and he tried to tell me one night that I can't watch the NBA because it's just one-on-one and three-point shooting, and I said, well, that's because you had no talent when you were in junior -- if you had Jamal Murray, I think you might give him the ball. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"You see it evolving, but I think the three-point shooting has changed the game completely, but when you have -- if you have good post-up people, you're going to go to them. Now the difference is someone like Jokic, you want to double him? Go ahead, because you're going to leave somebody wide open, and he's going to find him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I see it evolving, and I think it's great for the game. I love watching Denver play, and I love some of the things other people, too. Miami does a lot of the same stuff, move the ball. It's a fun way to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"Yeah, you know, it's funny because I tell the story all the time that when we started the first training camp and we were playing, and Chris Webber would go to the left elbow all the time, whether or not -- I don't care what we were running, he would run to the left elbow. Vlade would go to the right elbow. I told the coaches, maybe we should just put them there and use them at those spots. They both were good post-up players, but we thought, let's just use them, and they loved it. They loved it. Chris just loved going to the elbow, not all the way down, unless the play was for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"And Vlade, he was just a natural. We kind of just used those guys, and then we had Doug Christie, Peja Stojakovic who was just a great, great shooter, and Mike Bibby who could just flat out shoot it. But they all were willing to cut, they all were willing to do something to set it up for somebody else, and that's what I love about Denver's game. They make the right cut, they set it up for somebody else to get the shot. People don't always see that, but that's why that seem was so much fun to coach, because they were willing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"I've told the story before that people say we didn't defend in Sacramento, and during the regular season we didn't defend a lot because we outscored everybody, but in the Playoffs, that team was so intelligent that we put a game plan in and the other team had a hard time scoring on us because they were all together as a unit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,RICK ADELMAN,"That team was really special, and it was -- Portland and that team were two that I was very fortunate coaching both of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Biggest thing for us, we heard the noise throughout the whole playoffs. Biggest thing for us, we had the will and we had the belief, and we keep finding ways to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"K-Love is impactful even when he's not in the game. You come to the bench, he's always talking to you, telling you what he sees. K-Love has been here, what, five times? Four times? So he has seen everything but the win at this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"The biggest thing for us is, I'm glad he's on our team. He gives us that extra energy, that extra spark, whatever we need. He's all hands on deck."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"I mean, this is the Finals. This is what we live for. This is the opportunity that we have. This is the opportunity that we don't want to let slip away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"So biggest thing for me, man, I go out there, I play with a will, I play with passion and I try to leave it all on the court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Undrafted players can start in the Finals, be productive and it doesn't mean anything that he's undrafted."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"He's giving guys who are going through his path or down that road of, you're not this, you're not that, you're not this, and he's carving a space for himself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,I feel like a lot of people are going to know who Gabe Vincent is.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, when he torched us in the Olympics, in the exhibition game facing Nigeria. He came out with that type of energy, that type of voracity and that type of anger. I felt like, from there, he's one of us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Just trying to take away the cuts. I feel like that's a big part of the offense, the cut, because he's a great passer, their cuts. He sees open guys and just making them all try to take difficult shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"We just made winning plays. We know they are going to try to stop Duncan from shooting threes. You know they are going to guard him. Then you have Jimmy slipping to the rim. I feel like I'm one of the great passers in this league, so just making plays down the stretch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,I wouldn't even say it's playing coach. I think it's just UD being UD. He's in that role now where he's a vet. He's sharing wisdom. He's been in this league 20 years. He's won championships. He knows what it's like to be in these moments.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"To have a guy like that on your bench, it's more important than people think he is. He doesn't change. You know he's going to be honest with you. He's going to say it like it is, so I can't even repeat what he said in the huddle because it will just be a couple words."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,But he's so involved and so invested in us. He wants us to succeed. He wants us to have this great opportunity. He wants us to be successful.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,BAM ADEBAYO,"Black lives matter, people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"I think he loves these moments, as well. He loves the competition. I think this is similar to other guys on our team. I think this is when we get the best version of Spo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think personally, I think it's a balance. I think you have to be able to step away in whatever way you relax, to relax, but also you still have job to do. Similar to if you're in school and you're studying for a big test. You can't just sit there in the book all day. You're not going to retain as much information. You got to kind of step away and come back to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"There's definitely film being watched, workouts done, treatment done, whatever the case may be, but also time that's down away from the game or with family or watching a movie or whatever way people may relax."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I think we just had an aggression about us and we were just a little bit more deliberate in the way we attacked. It was more of a feel-out game for us, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,GABE VINCENT,"They did a number of things very well, and something that we can go back to the drawing board and make some adjustments about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"I mean, it's the Finals. It's never as simple as it seems. It's a complex game. They're a good team. It's going to be tough to beat them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"But we did see some things that we liked and we got some great looks, myself included. We've got to knock those down, and we've got great shooters on our team, and we will knock those down."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,Absolutely. It always is.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"Right away. Can't dwell on it. Luckily it was only Game 1, so we've got more to play. But I'm ready. I wanted to play right after the game was over. I'm not going to let that keep me down. I'm ready for the next game. Going to bring the same energy and effort and hopefully make some shots while I'm at it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"I don't know how to answer that. I think we had great looks the whole game. I liked our offense. We could be a little more intentional with the way we're attacking and just getting guys in their spots, but we'll do a better job of that next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,No. No. I had great open looks. I've just got to knock them down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, Bam is an All-Star. He had a great game. Now it's up to us to help him out. He did a great job finding his own shot and getting other guys involved, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,We're going to keep using him and getting him open into his spots and he's going to keep being great for us.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"No. I mean, Jokic is one of a kind. He's a hell of a player. They're good together. They play well with each other. They read each other really well and they're a tough tandem that we've got to try to keep a hold on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, it all evens itself out. Everything opens up, shooting and driving, when you're doing things at a high level. We'll just find ways to get downhill and attack and everything will open up the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,We knock down some shots that will just make guys' lives a little easier.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MAX STRUS,Just stay confident. One game at a time. Just go and get 'em in Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,The status has not changed yet. I'm not trying to be elusive about that. I don't know where that report came out that he was playing Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"All we are focused on right now is his process, continuing to do work and get prepared. Whenever that timeline is, where he's ready to go, I'll let you know."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Semantics. Semantics.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We're doing this game-by-game. I'll let you know tomorrow. The status hasn't changed. You can read into that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's different than Milwaukee. Milwaukee is a little bit more two-on-two. Staying home with the shooter is probably a little bit more like New York, or maybe Chicago."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But what they do, they do very well. You have to make reads. You can't predetermine. You cannot be a robot. We want everybody being aggressive, everybody being a live option."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Obviously, we want to get J.B. and Bam involved as much as possible. They are our two best players. We have to do it in different ways so it's not just a steady diet of whatever that may be. And there were certain aspects of what we did the other night were very good, and there are other areas offensively where we definitely need to improve and be more intentional."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, where do you start? You have two guys that can score 50 in a playoff game. One guy is a triple-double machine that loves to get guys involved. You go down the list of myriad of things you can do defensively, you have to check off some things that you don't really want to do because of both their ability to score and Jokic's ability to create something off-script."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But look, this is what the Finals is about. I said it before Game 1. You're not playing ducks. You're not playing easy competition. You have to find a way to overcome it, even if great players are playing great. We have proven that, and we can win and overcome regardless of how the game is going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Ideal situation would be if it's on our terms and we are controlling the tenor of the game, but we have also won games where we haven't been able to do that for the entire game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, but the intentionality of how we want to attack and appropriate spacing and areas where we can be more aggressive, and whether that leads to free throws or not, you can't control that. But certainly the attacks, and we didn't have enough of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I thought the free throw disparity was appropriate. Maybe we could have got two, four, six more based on a call here or a call there. But overall our attack numbers were lower, and that usually translates into lower free throw attempts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"At the end of the day, it still ended up in a loss. So, yes, we felt like there were some things that we could do better defensively, but the game could be totally different in Game 2. We have to be open to the competition and do whatever is necessary."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"In terms of the shooters, that's pretty simple. Let it fly. Ignite. Once they see two go down, it could be three, it could turn into six just like that snap fingers. As long as we are getting those clean looks, that's what matters. And obviously we want to have a little more balance with our attacks and paint opportunities, against a team that does a good job taking it away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I continu to make so many mistakes. It wasn't Shane it was Mike. But that was from a century ago. I barely remember those times.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Shooters need clarity and a great deal of confidence. And they get that from -- who cares if they get it from the head coach. Yeah, the coach is telling them to shoot it. I'd rather get the volume up and we'll play the percentages."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Not necessarily. There's respect. It's moments in between, like, hey, how do you tie this line so I can fish? Those are kind of the conversations laughter. Certainly wasn't X's and O's or schematics."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Probably more than anything, it was just an incredible life experience, something that hopefully will never happen ever again in our lifetime. When we entered into that bubble, we were just as out of our element as you could probably imagine from the outside. You just did not know how long you would be there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"There was an incredible emotional and mental challenge every single day. I think probably our two groups had real consistent spirit about, all right, this is different. Let's make the most of it, and we have a job to do here. But it was just an extraordinary time and experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, yeah. Keep it consistent, just what it's been throughout really the entirety of the season, but definitely the entirety of the playoff run. Try not to overreact to a good game or a bad game. Just kind of stay level headed with it all."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Thankful to have a staff and obviously a head coach in our corner, that's for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think it's an opportunity to learn. You watch the film, go to school on it, try to take away some things that you did well, and then certainly learn from some things that you can do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think in that sense there are some encouraging aspects of it. Obviously they're a really dynamic offensive team, so you're not going to be able to take away everything, but just make it difficult for them throughout the course of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"You know, I think part of it is when you're in it, you don't necessarily feel that you played as well as maybe you feel like you could have. I think that's part of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"They're obviously a really, really good offensive team. Just trying to learn from that, ways to kind of slow them down in offensive execution. Just seeing that there's opportunities for us to play to our strengths more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,We'll just try to do that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Just play them physical, setting the tone. Obviously they tried to really set the tone there early just around the paint. We're a pretty good team at protecting the paint in general."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,We'll learn from that and try to just have more of a kind of physical tone set early on.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"No, I think honestly it's very much kind of keep it the same, what it's been throughout the year. We've had stretches throughout this year where we've shot the ball great and where we haven't. Keep everything the same, routine the same, maintain consistency, and continue to have that belief and trust to let it fly and that it'll go in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, we got some good looks. Shot quality was there, and I think we can definitely execute better, and I think we will as the series goes on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"This is going to be obviously a challenging task. They're a good defense, good offense, pose a lot of challenges. But we're going to get better as the series goes on. We really believe that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"You know, credit to them for sure. They play differently than kind of defensively we've seen, particularly in the Eastern Conference, some of the things that they do is just a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But it's just an adjustment and getting film with how they're going to rotate and defend and X out on actions and do all that sort of stuff. We'll continue to get familiar with it and work through it, and that's what days today are like."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"You know, we can always attack more. We're an attacking team. That's kind of who we are. Get back to that identity for sure, but we thought we got a lot of good looks, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"In terms of overall strategy, that's more of a coach's question. For us players it's more about executing what the game plan is going in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think in the playoffs, obviously, it's about adjustments game to game, so we had some defensive adjustments. They got loose a few times. Then offensively just figuring out ways to beat them. They played a pretty good defensive game on us, so figuring out ways we could beat them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I thought I had great looks. Ball felt pretty good coming out of my hands, but yeah, I can't worry too much about percentages. They were good looks. I've got to keep shooting those, work on my shots on these couple days off. Hopefully some more fall next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, definitely. I just think an unrelenting will no matter what happens to you until your body can't go anymore, that was just kind of my thought process was like I'm going to keep working at this. This is what I love to do. My whole life growing up I never had a plan B. Always thought I was going to make it to the NBA. Always wanted to be an NBA player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Through all the surgeries, all the up and downs, that never changed. I think it takes a lot of faith, but it also takes a lot of willpower and things like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think there's really a ton of teams throughout the regular season who are good enough to make a Finals run. Tons of things can happen in the playoffs, whether it's injuries, things like that, that kind of give a team an edge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So, I think we knew we had this potential in us ever since this core came together, since we traded for Aaron, and we went on a good little win streak. We really felt like we had this potential back in the bubble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We felt like that Lakers series could have gone a completely different way. Anthony Davis hit a big game-winner, one of those games that put them up in the series, and they were a really good team so they got us there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But we knew we had the team because we were still very young. We knew if we keep this core together, a couple years down the road we could be right back here, and that's what we did."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"And shout-out to the guys that believed in this core, kept us together, and yeah, we're back here and we're excited."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, so in high school I actually played with a few really, really good passers. They're different than Nikola because they didn't come from the center position, but I played AAU with Trae Young who's also a tremendous passer. We fed off of each other. He would find me for amazing looks, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So, I'm used to playing alongside really, really good players. Nikola is a little different, like I said, because a lot of it's coming out of the post and things like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But it's very easy to play with guys like that. I'm very blessed to have good teammates like Nikola.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,Aaron is also a very good passer.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I feel like Jamal has gotten a lot better in that area.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So, we got a lot of dudes who make a lot of good plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, we had a few good looks. I missed one in the corner."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,Nikola missed a little post turnaround shot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I think Jamal missed a shot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But there definitely was a period in that game where we were just launching deep threes, contested shots. I don't think we've really seen a zone the way they do it, so it's hard to make adjustments in the middle of a game when you don't really know what's going on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But that's what the playoffs is about. We watch film, saw what they're doing with their zone. Hopefully attack a little bit better and make a few more of those shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think one thing about our team is we just take what the defense gives us. So, game to game, possession to possession, we've got a lot of guys who are very unselfish and will just take what the defense gives them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think, yeah, I'm still healing, still getting back to my full athleticism and things like that as time goes on, but at this point in the season there's a lot of soreness. When it comes to regular soreness, we all are experiencing that. These games are so intense, playing higher minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But overall, my healing from my surgeries and things like that, I still think I'm on the up and up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think this offseason will make another leap in that area, get to focus on some things you don't get to focus on during the season. But yeah, definitely sore at this point in the year for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, the bubble was pretty unique. So there was three hotels that teams were divided in. I can't remember if the Heat were in our hotel but walking around and going to different restaurants in the bubble, you see everybody. You see all the teams, all the different players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I don't really remember specific instances running into the Heat, but it might have been because they were in a different hotel. But the bubble was definitely a unique experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I look back on it and take a lot of enjoyment. That was kind of the first time playing with the Nuggets where I got consistent minutes, so it was kind of -- it was a good time for me because that still was considered my rookie season and I wasn't getting a ton of time before the bubble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But then we took that big break, I came to the bubble when some guys had COVID so they couldn't come out there, and I really got to play my game and shine with the Nuggets. That kind of started my role on the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But my favorite memory of the bubble is definitely the pina coladas at the pool. We would go to the pool every single day, me, Bol Bol, Torrey Craig. We would just go to the pool and drink pina coladas all day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I mean, we got five guys on the court. I thought Aaron set the tone when they switched. I think I took, like, 15 shots in the first two quarters, so there's really no need for him to be aggressive. We're dominating the game. And when they went zone, he found the pocket, found the middle of the floor and made some key shots in the paint."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,It was a great team game. We had a lot of guys. Mike played really well. KCP was solid on defense the whole game. We had a lot of guys step up throughout the game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just to stay with it. You know, life is going to happen. Stuff is going to happen. Just got to keep the mental fortitude to bounce back in whatever it is, and stay strong. This, too, shall pass. It goes for everything, negative and positive. So just keeping a level head and knowing that you'll see the light at the end of the tunnel one day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just understanding what they are trying to do. They shoot a lot of threes, so they don't have anybody that is going to the rim like that. They missed a lot of really good looks, as well. I think so did we."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"But yeah, you've just got to show your hand, stay disciplined. I think we did a good job of setting our defense. We had guys on a string, and our low man was there repeatedly. And like I said, just trying to defend -- knowing they are trying to get to the free throw line, so trying to defend without fouling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Nah. I had one of my high school teammates who played for the Heat at the time, so I saw him a lot. But other than that, no."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,It's not just the Finals. Way before that. It's meditating before games or at halftime. Taking time for myself to reflect with the good or the bad and come out with the right energy before the game or during the game if I need to adjust.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it's not just basketball. It helps me out with myself, reflecting on myself and being able to have a conversation with myself only so that I can improve within myself. I think that's important for everybody. But basketball-wise, it just helps me refresh and get back to base and a free mind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, we missed some really good looks. I know Miami missed a lot of shots, but we missed some point-blank shots, as well. When they went zone, Jok missed an open 15-footer. I missed an open 10-footer. Mike missed a wide-open corner three. I missed a catch-and-shoot on the wing, which was wide open. I think there's a couple more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"But we got the looks we needed. We just didn't knock them down. If we knock them down, I think they will start to break up the zone a little bit and go back to man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"But it doesn't matter. I think we played a good game. They were trying to fight back all game. I thought we did a good job of just maintaining the lead and not playing conservative by using the clock and not turning the ball over, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"I mean, I don't -- like I said, first round, Finals, it's nothing until you win it, right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"So we haven't won it yet. So until we win it, I think we'll look at it a little differently by then."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's a really good defender. He's got great hands and a great IQ on defense and knows what the player is trying to get to, tendencies, cat-and-mouse, rule of vert, just everything. He talks early in pick-and-rolls. Post defense. There's everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think he does a great job on defense. Everybody is going to have something that they don't do well on the court, and for that to be the one thing that he doesn't do particularly well and be able to still do it at a high level is pretty impressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's been doing it all season. He's been getting better at it, too. So I only see room for improvement for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Any series. You just try to win every game. It's first to four, no matter how you get it done. Obviously, you want to take advantage of being at home. Love playing at home. But any game you can win, you take. So yeah, we're looking forward to just winning every single game that we play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think he won Strength Coach of the Year a season ago. So he's well regarded, not only by people in this building but throughout the NBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Ever since he took over as the head strength coach for our team, he's been phenomenal in terms of not just Nikola, but all of our players, getting them in shape, getting them stronger."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's constantly aware from the nutritional standpoint just all the way across the board. Felipe has been a huge asset not just to myself, but the entire group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think throughout these 16 playoff games so far our bench has been great. Regular season, some of those non-Nikola minutes were somewhat of a crapshoot. You didn't know what you were going to get."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think a big reason for us playing at the level that we've played at was that when Nikola has gone out, the other guys have stepped up and played well. Right now, we have a three-man bench group, Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, Christian Braun. I think those guys are playing well. If Nikola is out, Jamal and Michael or both of them are on the floor so we have two of our top three scorers on the court at all times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But the key for that group is to defend. If you can get stops, you can get out and run. That's when that group is at its best, because you don't have the luxury of coming down and playing through Nikola in the post or wherever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So defend, rebound, run, and then other guys just playing their game and playing the games to the best of their ability."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, he can't play 48. I mean, I've got to get Nikola out. So he's been running the first and third quarter, and he sits to start the second and fourth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think overall, I think Nikola's defense has been a real positive. I think you have to get past the eye test with Nikola because I think most people just think of great defensive players as a guy who is blocking a shot or just making a great athletic play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Nikola does it differently. He has a tremendous IHe's got great anticipation. He's got unbelievable hands for deflections, blocks. He's got unbelievable feet for deflections."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, Miami, they're going to run a lot of pick-and-rolls. I think they lead the Playoffs in double drags set per game, as well as just over 50 direct screen-and-rolls per game, with Jimmy handling the majority of those."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So through 16 games now people put Nikola in just a crazy amount of pick-and-rolls, and we, I think, do a pretty good job of mixing up our coverages, mixing up our levels. Sometimes he's up, sometimes he's down, sometimes we switch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"We got into in the Lakers series Nikola switching on to LeBron at times. When you first hear that, it doesn't -- there is no way you are going to switch Nikola on to LeBron. But he actually did a pretty good job at times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I think his defense is underrated and I think his maturation in the eight years, I think that's been a big part of it, as well. Him understanding that I have to be the best defensive player I can be to help this team become the best team that they can be. He doesn't shy away from that responsibility."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I don't think we played well in Game 1. I watched that tape, and they were 5 of 16 on wide-open threes. As I told our players this morning, the fact that they got 16 wide-open threes is problematic, and if you think that Max Strus is going to go 0 for 9 again or Duncan Robinson is going to go 1 for 5 again, you're wrong."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"The fourth quarter, we gave up 30 points, 60 percent from the field, 50 from three, 6 of 12 from the three-point line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I told our players today, don't read the paper, don't listen to the folks on the radio and TV saying that this series is over and that we've done something, because we haven't done a damn thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"We won Game 1. The reason I told our players I was excited this morning is because we won Game 1 and we didn't play well, and there's so many things we can do better. If we do those things at a better level, we'll have a chance to win Game 2 tomorrow night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,I thought our pick-and-roll defense was poor. I thought our shrink the floor was poor. I felt they got 11 offensive rebounds. Bam had four Jimmy had three.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's just playing to your strengths and feeling how the game goes. You never know how a team is going to guard you. Early in that game, they were switching some things that allowed Aaron to sit down in that paint and post up a smaller player. I think he had 14 of his 16 points in that first half and got us off to a great start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's something that organizationally, that's something, conversations with Calvin Booth when I took over last summer, that was their priority. When you looked at last year's NBA Finals, not many small players out there because people are going to find you. We wanted to have positional size, strength, versatility. I think Calvin has done a hell of a job kind of putting this group together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I thought we got some pretty good looks. The reason their zone was effective in that fourth quarter was because we didn't get any stops. They shot 60 percent, which allowed them to set up in their zone every possession, it seemed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But you look at the first two shots we got against their zone, Nikola was in the middle of the paint -- great look. Jamal gets one middle of the paint -- great look. We miss those. Michael Porter gets a corner three -- great look. Doesn't go in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I talked about them being 5 of 16 on wide-open threes. I think maybe we were 1 for 6 on wide-open threes. But with how heavy they are in terms of guarding the paint, we also have to generate more threes and more quality threes, and I think those will be there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think those two especially have just a tremendous amount of experience in doing so. They've played together for seven years now, and we've been in a lot of big games. Obviously never in the Finals before. But Jamal and Nikola to me has been a potent two-man game for many, many years now. They know how to communicate with each other without even speaking, just reading and playing off of each other and making the right reads."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the key to that two-man game is making sure the other three players are spaced correctly so they can operate in space, and no matter how you guard that, there's a counter to it. You're talking about two really skilled, talented and unselfish players who are willing to make the right play every time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, we didn't go in saying we're going to make Bam Adebayo beat us. We came in with full respect for Bam Adebayo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But if you're going to score 26 points on 25 shots, that's something we're willing to live with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But we can do a better job. That's something that we talked about today, giving him different looks, making sure we're contesting, making sure we're shrinking the floor, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,"But he's a very effective player. He can playmake. He can rebound and push. He scores in the pocket. Offensive rebounds. Whatever it is, Bam can control the game in a lot of different ways. That's the reason he's an All-Star. We just have to make sure that we are working and contesting and making him feel us as best as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,I'm not surprised. Bam played a great game. He got to his spots. He made jump shots. He was aggressive. That's what we need from him.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think what it opened up, Bam was able to get in the paint. He was the one guy that was getting paint touches. It helped us, kind of settled us down a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But yeah, they obviously won the game, so it worked for them, but we've got to continue to find ways to get him the ball and for him to stay aggressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Exactly what I said, what you just said. Got some really good looks. Keep shooting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"I think Max is a very confident player. He got -- those shots he missed, he won't miss them again. That's the game of basketball. Sometimes -- it's a make-or-miss league. The one thing about Max is he's going to continue to shoot, and the one thing about our team, we're going to continue to tell him to shoot the ball, keep going, keep shooting, keep pushing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"At the end of the day we need him to stay aggressive and make shots and shoot shots. We've got a good locker room, so we believe in what he does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"I think this time of year you've got to stay locked in. You've got to watch film. You've got to stay in the game, stay in tune, stay in tuned to what's going on. For me, I stay in tune."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, you go get dinner, you hang out with your friends and family to kind of get away, but for the most part I focus on the game to see what I can do and see what I can help the team do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But as the Playoffs continue to go and get deeper, you've got to stay focused on the games. You can't let your mind wander too much. Yeah, you've got to take some time away, but you've got to stay focused on the game and watch the film and see what you can do to help the team get better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, a lot. You mean like what? What type of positives? You didn't ask that part."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,I would think we just took some -- we got good shots. We got good looks. We got to our spots. We got the situation that we wanted to be in offensively. Defensively we figured some things out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But in the Playoffs every single game is different, especially in the Finals. Every single game is going to be a different type of game, different brand of basketball, different approach, and different guys are going to play well, so we're seeing some good things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I was with him when he started. Ish to this day is one of my guys that I still call my rook. I appreciate it because he's a guy who persevered, wasn't the greatest shooter, wasn't the greatest this, but he just found a way to find a niche in this league and find a niche on every single team he's been on, and to be a great veteran, a great veteran presence, a great positive vibe for every team he's played for."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Thirteen teams is a lot of teams, but obviously he's done his job, and he's still in the NBA, and he's on a team right now that's in the Finals. He's done something correct, and I'm just proud to have a guy like that say he was under my wing for a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yeah, I can't think of -- I'm pretty old in this game right now. I played Tim Duncan and Tony Parker. Honestly, that's a great combination that I got the opportunity to play against. Jamal and Jokic, they're deadly because they both can score, pass the ball. They're big targets, and they have a great feel for each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But yeah, that combination, they're very, very good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"No, I don't think it affected us. I think we were ready to play. I think Coach always says it, he said it, give us our parachutes and drop us in, and we'll be prepared to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"I think Denver played a really good game the first game, and we missed a lot of shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But it's all about preparation now for the next game, so we'll be well prepared to go, and we'll be ready to go tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"He's lying because I've got to go to Spain so I call him when I go to Spain, so yes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"Yes, I will see him in Marbella in a few weeks. Definitely will go visit him because he's my guy and they have a great facility over there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KYLE LOWRY,"But yes, I will be in Spain in a couple weeks. Looking forward to seeing my guy, my amigo."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course, it's motivation. It's huge because it's never done before. We are going to leave some legacy if we do it. But I don't know, are kids supposed to look up to me or whatever, I think they need to have their own path."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I don't think about that much. I'm just playing. I'm just playing, and my focus has never been those kinds of records or whatever, whatever the media are putting on me. I'm just trying to win a game and just play every game. Go step-by-step and play every game to win a game, as simple as that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, he is always the guy who has optimism and energy is so high. I'm completely opposite of him. Just to have him since I came here and we are growing together, and now we have an opportunity to do something nice, I think it's good for both of us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,Some possessions we play amazing and some possessions we didn't play good. Some quarters we played really good. I think that's basketball. That's why it's a live thing. You cannot predict what's going to happen.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, of course, we are going to be better, but we are going to take 1-0 for us. Just being focused for 48 minutes, I think that's going to be the key. Just the way how they play, they don't let their guard down and they are always playing the same way with the same pace. I think that's why they are great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think I need to get a trophy, my friend, I don't know what it is. I'm joking, I'm joking laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not just me. I think when you see the last game, us against Miami, in the first three quarters, they score 65, 68 points. I think that's really amazing. And then you can see the fourth quarter, they scored 30-something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's different. It's different when you play for Serbia. It's always a little bit more of emotions, adrenaline. The whole country is cheering for you, and that's the dream for every player that ever played probably from Serbia, to play for the national team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's a little bit more of, I don't say -- let's say pressure, but it's not pressure. Just emotions. It's a little bit of everything, let's say, for one little next level of everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"The shots that he make, it was pretty easy shots for him. I need to do a little bit better job just to make him uncomfortable. I think he can go to the shots that he wants, if that make any sense, but I just need to be there just to -- him to do another step or another dribble or another move. Just don't give him the easy ones, let's say like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, I mean, I think in the past somebody is always injured. We never had a constant group of guys coming off the bench, if that makes any sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Now when we kind of know the rotation, I think the guys are doing a really good job of playing and being aggressive and attacking when they see the seams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Oh, I like it. Doing good. It's raining today. It was rainy when I came here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Oh, I like it, my friend. Appreciate it. Appreciate it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we are just waiting for the game to come. I think when the game comes, everything is going to be normal. Right now, everything is a little bit too much."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Thank you, my friend."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not just him. I think he played with a lot of good players. He was on some good teams, and he saw a little bit of everything. But Ish, Jeff and him are kind of all old hats, let's say like that. When they talk, I think everybody listens because if you listen to them, you can hear some really smart things that can help you play the game. I really appreciate and am really thankful for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think from the jump we've just got to set the tone defensively. They're a big, physical team, so we know they're going to try to bully us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"We've got to stand our ground, be physical, and keep pushing the ball with pace and make it as tough as possible on the defensive end and just keep playing our game, move the ball side to side, and make good plays on offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yes, I've waited for this opportunity to play in the NBA Finals. My story has been a whirlwind getting here, so I'm definitely grateful and blessed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,So I'm going to take advantage of my opportunity and do whatever I've got to do to help the team win.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, like I just said, my journey has been a little crazy. I went to a smaller school so I had to work my way up, but I'm glad that I'm here. Put in a lot of work, and I'm going to trust my work and continue to play my game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"For sure. We only shot two free throws that game, so we definitely need to get to the free-throw line more, attack the paint, set the tone, and then spray out from there and be more aggressive for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Just make it as difficult as possible. Like I said, be physical with them. They have a lot of different actions. They have a great passing big man, a lot of different guys who can score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,We've just got to be physical and communicate about different things they're doing and just keep playing hard.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, for me I'm a younger player, so having those guys in my ear has been great for me, just learning different things. They've been in these positions before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"K Love has a ring Udonis has three rings I'm pretty sure. So just learning from those guys can help me, help me in the long run."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, we're not discouraged at all. This is a great basketball team. We're a great basketball team. We're going to have to compete to win this. They won Game 1, that gives us time to respond and make adjustments and go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, like I said, they've been here before. They know what it takes to win a championship. They know what it takes to win these close playoff games. They're going to have a lot of information, a lot of experience for the younger guys that we've got."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,They have confidence as well. So that veteran leadership is going to be big for us for sure.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Just relaxing and chilling, taking your mind off basketball, doing stuff -- our families are here. Hanging out with our families and just watching film and going from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"For me, I've just been relaxing, doing what I normally do outside of basketball, and then when basketball comes I get back to the film and lock back in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I'm not a big hockey person. I actually did go to a Panthers game. It's pretty cool to watch. Now that you've said that, what time do they play? 600 here? I might watch. It's the Game 1, right, Stanley Cup? I'll probably watch that, thank you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I actually live in Miami in the off-season. My wife is from there. And he's somebody who whenever I see him, we break bread and we speak. He's somebody I look up to as far as his longevity, how he grinded through the league. He paved his way he did it his way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"For me, that's somebody who you've got to look up to, you've got to respect. For me, he's somebody who I can always count on when I need some knowledge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I think for us it's about looking at film and figuring out things we can get better at. I think at the end of the day it's about effort, but there's some things we can change that we can get better at that we've spoken about. We've just got to go out there on the floor and just execute those plans."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Oh, man. To keep it short, I think it's mostly just staying positive in that grind. Sometimes when you're battling it uphill, you're trying to figure out a way -- things might not go your way. That's when the negativity can kick in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"But for me, it's about keeping the positivity and everything to do with being prepared to work every day, not being afraid of messing up or being uncomfortable. It's about growth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,I've been through it all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Negative is always going to be there somehow, some way, in some form. It's always going to creep. But I think that positivity has just got to override it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I think he kept the game simple. I think he uses his size to his ability. He was a force down low, and that was great for us to get us off to a good start."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"You can't ever predetermine how a game is going to go. I think you just try to read the game, and I think that's something he did very well at the beginning of the game. He got to his spots, got out in transition, got smaller guys on him, and used his size."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"But it's the Finals, man. This is everything. The energy is the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"He's a great guy. His energy that he brings every day, it keeps us going. His passion for his work is amazing. He gives us great energy, and I love Felipe, man, even Claus. They come in and they come to work and they prepare us each day to guard our own floor. They keep our strength right. They're a big part of what we do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I do? I've been there before. Barbosa took me there, I can't tell you, it was a long time ago. We were in Boston. We went for All-Star break. I had a great time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Yes, thank you for all your support. I can't speak the language, but thank you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I really don't care. I just want to play. To be honest, I don't care how long we've got. My job is just to be prepared for the time I'm given on the floor, be there for my teammates."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"So one day, two days, three days, it doesn't matter. On game day, I'll be prepared and I'll be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"Yeah, 100 percent. I could have played yesterday. That's the energy that the Finals gives you. This is what you live for. This is what you play for. You sacrifice everything for these moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I'm just excited to be here, and right now we have a 1-0 lead, but we have to continue to protect home court, try to go up 2-0."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"My wife and kids are gone right now. They've gone home to Miami for when we get there, so I'll be able to get some sleep tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Defense. Defense. So, when he's sitting on the floor we need to lock in on defense. That's probably the most important, crucial aspect of the non-Nikola Jokic minutes because that's how our defense -- that's how we get our offense, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"So, when we get stops on defense, we can get out and run, and we're really fast and versatile when it comes down to defending."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"No, no, definitely thrive, not surviving. I feel like surviving is almost like fear based. No, we ain't got no fear."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Well, I think they got a few too many open looks. It's going to happen. But we need to cut down on the number of open looks that they get. Getting back in transition, keeping them off the offensive glass, and then just kind of tightening up on the defensive end, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"I think they stopped switching. They started to -- I'm not entirely sure how they're going to play the pick-and-roll this time between me and Jamal. They went under one time and got back to Jamal, but they were switching 1 through 4."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"So, I don't expect them to do that again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"But I'm going to just run out in transition, try and get deep seals, continue to be aggressive with whoever is in front of me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"No, we've lost a game. We've lost since April."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Oh, at home? We just take a lot of pride at home. Yeah, we take a lot of pride in protecting our home floor. We have a great fan base that's behind us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,I think that's what it really comes down to is just understanding what it means to keep home-court advantage.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"It's huge, man. It's priceless. JG is so basketball savvy. It's like he's playing chess out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"He keeps everybody poised, solid, professional, and he's still a hell of a talent. To have a guy that can produce and create on the floor is extremely important, and then a guy that can talk to you and give you advice and lead from off the floor is just as crucial."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,It's just solid. It's all sound advice. It makes sense. It's to the point. It's not confusing or left to interpretation. It is exactly what we need to hear every time.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"No, no, it wasn't too much of a switch. I think what was interesting in my first six years in Orlando, I had six different coaches, and before that it was Sean Miller at Arizona and then my high school coach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"So, within eight years, it was eight different coaches and a multitude of coaching staffs and training staffs. There was a lot of movement in there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"In that I got to pick the brain of brilliant coaches for maybe just a year at a time, but still, I got to pick up little pieces from Jacque Vaughn, James Borrego, Frank Vogel, Steve Clifford, Scott Skiles. I hope I'm not missing anybody. Sorry if I am."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Short time we had together, the year that we had together, and then kind of bring it together to an organization like Denver where Coach Malone had already been here for a certain number of years. Coach Malone being here for a number of years and already having a -- kind of like something already going, established here, a foundation. He already had a foundation and had been playing on it for three years, four years, five years. I'm not even entirely sure how long. Five years, maybe six years. Just being able to come in and be myself, that was the biggest thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"They told me from the jump, we got you for a reason. Just be yourself and everything will work out. That's what it came down to. Even in the first game, it was just like a breath of fresh air just because it was like the first time I was able to just like get a back cut and then just like an easy dunk. There was just so much going on on the floor, so much spacing, and it seemed like everybody complemented each other so well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, you just can't be complacent with this team. You can't be lackadaisical. You can't sleep on this team. This team has no quit. They will continue to fight through the entirety of the game. You've got to understand that about this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,You can't take your foot off the gas with these guys.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, throughout the years I got to develop a lot of great relationships in Orlando, whether it be the coaching staff or player development or some of my teammates. Yeah, they still reach out to me and give me some advice from here and there and just let me know that they're still rooting for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"It's difficult because the people around you get excited, as well. So, you have to keep like a calmness. You have to keep a poise to you, like an intense energy but calm, while the rest of everybody else is really frenetic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,It's important to just make the main thing the main thing and just be focused on what the task is at hand.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"One more thing about that -- my bad -- about the media, you know. Still reading the newspaper and the news around the world is important and not being consumed with kind of the bubble that is the NBA, even though it expands during the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,AARON GORDON,"But still, being aware of the other things that are going on outside of the media, the NBA, and the things that are going on outside of the world and reading world news is still really important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah. I try to, as much as possible. Just to keep my teammates engaged on that end because we can sometimes get lost, and then we're scrambled a lot. Just trying to keep them focused on the game plan that we've got defensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It does change a lot, but whatever Coach is drawing up or we're talking about in the huddle, I try to keep telling the guys on the court what we're doing and where to be. Even myself, just to remind myself I'm supposed to be in these positions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Anybody can come out and say it, but it seems like I'm the main person just doing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"They had a lot of wide-open threes. They generated I think 16 open threes, so they had wide-open threes, and they just missed them. But we had almost like 50 something contests on all shots. I want to credit our defense for making them miss, and just got to continue to do it Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Stay motivated. We're here don't fumble the ball on the 1-yard line I would say. We've got three games left, let's stay focused and let's get this championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"That fourth quarter. We came out a little flat. We had great looks at the basket. We just didn't knock them down. But we wanted to get into our offense a little bit earlier than 14 seconds on the clock and just play normal basketball, our basketball, go through our game plans and our plays and just try to get a great shot every time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"We could be better. We were happy we got the win, of course, but our pace and how we played throughout the whole game, we can be a lot better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"No difference. I've got that question so many times. They're both high-IQ basketball players. They make their teammates better, and they can score on any level. I don't see no difference."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Oh, man, he still does to this day. Every game it's something different, or in practice he's showing something that's like real magical. But he never ceases to impress me, just playing with him. He's made me a better player, makes his teammates better around him. He just likes to see everybody happy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I don't see him much off the court, but just being active in our group chat, just talking, joking around a lot. He's really a comedian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just been taking care of my body, staying in the gym, being ready for any opportunity that I get, and just basically just staying ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Not much. I just think I've got to do a better job of getting the ball, demanding the ball, being more aggressive. That's just that, and that will change come Game 2. Yes, they do have some really good defenders, but I have seen really good defenders before."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I think this whole playoff season has been a chess match for everybody on this team, not just myself. So you know, going into Game 2, whatever it takes to win, if I've got to pump-fake five times or 15 times, you've just got to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. I'm going to continue play the right way. I'm going to pass the ball to my shooters the way I have been playing the entire playoffs, the entire year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"But yeah, I think I've got to be more aggressive putting pressure on the rim. I think that makes everybody's job a lot easier. They definitely follow suit whenever I'm aggressive on both sides of the ball. So I have to be the one to come out and kick that off the right way, which I will, and we'll see where we end up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,Not at all. I think I played basketball the right way.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Well, my daughter is out here, so ripping and running with her. Played a lot of Spades. Spades didn't go too well for me yesterday, now that I think about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I'm going to do an escape room tonight. I think my guys went and saw Spiderman today. Just doing normal stuff, because at the end of the day, I'm as normal as they come. It's not always about basketball. It will never always be about basketball. That's how I regroup. I stay consistent in that because that's what I know I can fall back on. My guys, they are going to love me whether I win or lose. My daughter is going to love me whether I win or lose. So that's what I focus on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yeah, I need to say to them I'm still going to throw you the ball, and if you miss the next ten, if you're open on that 11th one, I'm still going to throw you the ball, because you'll never be the reason why we lose. It's always a group effort. I want you to take the same shots because they are going to be there. We are going to throw you the ball. Stay aggressive because you've been the reason that we have won so many games before. You are going to be the reason that we win games now, and that's never going to change."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I have a lot of faith in those guys. I'm in their corner, Bam is in their corner, Spo, Coach Pat, everybody. So when everybody is in your corner, you only have one job to do Shoot the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Do that again. Maybe hold them to 12 less points. Hopefully we can win the game. That's it. No matter how many points they score, we just need to score more. Get some more stops, play harder. Do things the right way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"We're okay. We really are. We are very calm. We are very collected. We have so much confidence, still. It's not going anywhere. We're going to believe in one another, always, no matter what, home or away. And we're still going to get four."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think too much has to be said, I really don't. Down 0-3 up 3-0, you've got to get to four. It's never over. Nobody is ever counted out. You've got to get to four. Once you get to four, it's over with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"So down 0-1, we know we are going to get to four. We are in there laughing, in there smiling, knowing that we could play better. We will play better. We have to be better if we want to win. Not too much is said. It's all about what we're going to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Tough. Tough. They do everything well. You've got to guard both of them, majority of the time with two people. We've got to figure that out because that's coming at us every possession -- if not every possession, damn sure every other possession."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"We'll key in on it. We'll lock on it. But it's tough, no matter who it is, guarding those two guys, who are willing passers and can give you 50 on any given night. Then they have shooters everywhere on the floor. But you're going to have to do hard things to get to where you want to get to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think he does well for what he's able to do. He moves his feet well. He's constantly making guys make decisions whenever they get into the paint. Then his outlet passes from a defensive rebound are very, very elite that, he's been doing his entire career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"As much as everybody looks at what he does on the offensive side of the ball, he's a hell of a defender, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"Pass the ball, which is what I'm going to do. Shoot the ball. Make some shots, which I'm capable of doing, as well. I just don't think we played our best game of basketball, and that's okay. We've just got to be better come tomorrow, which we will be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"But I'm still playing the game the right way. It's not being passive. It's getting my guys involved, because whenever they make shots, my job is a lot easier."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"The country music started when I was in high school. I didn't like it much in high school when I first started listening to it, but my friends at the time, the people I was close with, that's all they listened to, so I kind of got used to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Then I started remembering the lyrics when I got to Vermont Academy during baseball games, because I was on varsity baseball my senior year, and they'd warm up to Zac Brown Band Homegrown, and that was like the first song."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"And by Lady A, Downtown was like the first two songs I really liked."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I think we got shots that we liked. Mike had an open three Jamal had three and Jokic had 15-foot shots open they just missed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"We worked on it today, so hopefully we can execute tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"No, we felt like we played a lot better, so we tweaked a few things on both ends of the floor. We know Miami is a great team. They are going to come out Game 2 and play extremely hard, so got to be ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"I could not hit the ball. I was a bunt -- I laid it down. But I was a great base runner and infielding, but I could not hit the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I loved my time in Vermont, but basketball-wise it was great for me, just living on campus, being able to get in the gym whenever I wanted, and then playing better competition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"And I really started lifting a little bit in high school, so just to focus on basketball a lot more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, he texted after the Heat won and was like, see you in Miami. I'll see you there, but that's about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, AG was huge for us, like he is all year, just chillin in the paint on smaller defenders, scoring whenever he wanted. So want him to continue doing that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"After my freshman year at Wakefield, I knew I was going to have to do that at some point, but my mom didn't want me to leave the house so young."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BRUCE BROWN,"So yeah, after freshman year we talked about it and she was like, after your sophomore year you can go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I mean, I think the guys did a really good job of handling that for me. They built a pretty big lead, and when I come in, my job is just to elevate it. There's not much nerves with what I do. I come out and try to guard people, play defense, get our guys the ball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's not too much nerves with my job, and like I said, those guys do a really good job of building a lead and my job is just to add on to that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Obviously their coach is a great coach so you know that was a really good move for them at the time, and I think that we're a tough team to zone because of our shooters and we have Nikola, so I don't know, I think that we're going to attack it differently, be ready for it now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So I don't know if it'll have the same effect, but they have great players that play really good defense, whether it's man or zone, and they have a really good coach. They're going to make adjustments like that and they're going to throw different things at us, and that's what they're really good at, and that's why they're here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, they're a really good defensive team, so there's going to be nights where it's tough to score, but you win basketball games making it tough on them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think we did a good job of making it tough on them. They missed some open shots, some stuff we have to tighten up, but the best part about that is we won when we played bad."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"We didn't think we played well, and obviously we are going to come back and play a better game. We know they're going to come back and play a better game. If we just do what we're supposed to do, we're going to hit shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They didn't hit shots like they thought they would, but we had great shooters miss a lot of shots, too. We know they're going to be better, but we know we're going to be better. You want to win basketball games when you play bad. That's the most important part."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,Mom doesn't give me constructive criticism at all. Mom is more critical --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"It's not constructive most of the time. Laughter. She'll throw it in there every once in a while, but mom is definitely the critical one of the bunch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Most of the time honestly it's at halftime or something. If she sees something she doesn't like, she'll text me and let me know. Obviously I see it after the game right away. Mom is definitely the critical one, but I know she means it with love."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, Coach Self texted me before the game. I think I saw it after. He just told me good luck. That means a lot coming from him, obviously."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"And then my brother is playing for him, too, so I've gotten to talk to him more recently. But yeah, he texted me before the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think it's a really cool thing, so hopefully everybody has that experience. I think it's really cool. I see Jamal talk to his dad all the time. They talk before games, and that's obviously a really cool moment for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think that being in these moments, obviously the Final Four kind of helped me with that, like I said I've kind of been here before and I think we played a million games this year it feels like. It's just another game at this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"This game means a lot, but you've kind of got to approach it the same way you approach everything else. Same routine. So I think that's why we're so good. We got a lot of guys that are really consistent with the routine. Just because it's the Finals game we don't try to change anything. We try to be us. We come out there and play hard, and I think that's why we win a lot of games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"I don't know. I guess you'll have to ask the Nuggets. But for me, it was just a great opportunity for me. I feel like all those shots were in my wheelhouse, and I've been shooting them all season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"I think it's the nature how Denver is playing it. They don't want him getting downhill and being in open space. I feel like the biggest thing when we're in pick-and-roll is for me to get him open. That's the point of the pick-and-roll, to get my guy open and let him have space."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,Open shots. Open looks. Biggest thing for us is making both of them work in not as much space and really making them take difficult shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,We missed a lot of open shots that we usually make. I feel like that won't happen again. We had a lot of open shots that rimmed in and out usually go in.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"Our process? We got a lot of pocket pass, open threes. Watching film, we had a lot of space to work with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,We definitely know they are going to make adjustments. But the fourth quarter is definitely a big emphasis of ours after watching film and understanding what we did and the opportunity we had.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like we can protect home like no other. Having an opportunity to be 1-1 and then you take care of home, that's a 3-1 split, and you try to close out the series from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It's good. He's ready to go.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It actually has been really important for our group, just to bring that added veteran decorated experience. They've been through the battles. They really infuse a lot of confidence in our young guys. I don't even want to call them young guys anymore."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But also, the example that they set. When I say they're decorated champions, even at this stage in their career, they're willing to take on different roles, and they both have started for us this year, they both have come off the bench, and they've both been really effective in both of those roles. And right now, where we are, this is just what makes the most sense. But they're willing to do whatever, and they just want to help this team get over the top."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'm not sure. No, I don't know. We're going over our prep and that kind of thing. I don't know if that's what you're talking about. I'm glad Pat has never given me a quiz. I probably would have failed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, of course we both feel the same way about that, and it feels at times awkward, us talking about it. It feels like we're lecturing other organizations when we have no business telling them how to do their business. We can only speak from our experiences."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we're definitely going to have to go to school on it. They are in a pretty good rhythm, especially in that first half. Our disposition, the multiple efforts, the resolve in the second half was much better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But you get to this level, it has to be complete games of that kind of disposition. Even if you have that, you are not always going to win all the possessions that you want."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,But that's what you expect. You don't expect it to be easy when you get to this Final round.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This is a great challenge. It's going to require more. We will get to work and see what we can do better, what we can do harder, what we can do with more effort, what we can do with more focus, etc."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, that's what we need from everybody, regardless of when you come into the game, how many minutes you're getting, those inspiring minutes. And that's what our team is about, having a roster of guys that just come out there and you're making great efforts, you're impacting the game and then it inspires the next guy to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We need more of those kind of things. He's kept himself ready, and those are good minutes, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We had some good, clean looks from the three-point line. Then we had too many possessions where we didn't work it to get the possession on our terms."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But you have to credit them with their size and really protecting the paint and bringing a third defender. Things have to be done with a lot more intention and a lot more pace, a lot more detail."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We are an aggressive, attacking team, and so if we are not getting those kind of opportunities at the rim or at the free throw line, we have to find different ways to be able to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, they are fine. I mean, they are not going to get sick at sea. If they are shooters, you're not always going to be able to make all the shots that you want. Then you have to find different ways to impact the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Our game is not built just on the three-point ball. We have proven that time and time again. We can win games. We can win series, regardless of how the three is going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But we also have ignitable guys. You see a couple go through and that also can become an avalanche. One way or the other, we have to find a way to get the job done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I thought he had some good opportunities right in his sweet spot and then also some opportunities at the rim. Then I thought some of our detail with the spacing and the pace and our intention of our offense kind of got us jammed up.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It always kind of could look different, a few of these threes go down at the right time, a few of the layups right at the rim or the short ones go down at the right time, that also could change your perspective or tenor of how you think things are going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,But we do need to do things better. I think that part is clear.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's different. That's what you expect going into this series. They're a passing and cutting team, but also they are an aggressive team, and so are we."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I didn't even look at the box score yet, but like I said, I think the disposition, the efforts were more appropriate in the second half. But that's not enough. It has to be for a full game, and you also have to make some plays when you're beat."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The plays in between it's not always going to happen perfectly. It's not always going to happen based on the scheme. That's the nature of our team, is we find a way to compete and overcome whatever it is. We need a lot more of that in Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, I don't know. I never point to the scheme. Scheme is not going to save us. It's going to be the toughness and resolve, collective resolve. That's us at our finest, when we rally around each other and commit to doing incredibly tough things. That's what our group loves to do more than anything, to compete, to get out there and do things that people think can't be done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The efforts made that work in the second half, but we're proving that we can do that with our man defense, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we've been through this before. Like, they are ignitable snapping fingers. They have heard it from us. They will hear it from us. I love those looks that those guys get. I love it when they see a couple, two or three go down that can turn into five or six."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But I also love it, you know, that toughness and grit, that we don't have to depend on that. We can find different ways and different solutions to get a win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,Thrilled to be here for these Finals. You've written so much about them already. Having a first seed against an eight seed just adds that much more intrigue to the competition.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think they've both had separate, interesting paths to make it here, to have a Play-In team, obviously in the Miami Heat, be here, and one that, as Coach Spoelstra said, struggled in many ways throughout the season. But he said something along the lines, embrace the grind of the regular season. Had a lot of injuries they had to overcome. I think the Miami Heat lost the third-most games, players to injuries over the course of the season. But here they are."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"It's interesting, something also I've been thinking about are the similarities despite them being the first and the eighth seed. One, again, beginning with ownership, you have the Kroenke family and the Arison family. Both Arisons have been involved with ownership a few years longer than the Kroenkes. But with Stan and Josh, you have a father and son combination, with Josh of course taking on the presidency of the team. Same thing with the Arisons, with Micky and of course Nick is the CEO of the organization and work together as a fantastic team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Both families are very engaged with the league office, serve on several committees and don't miss anything that goes on in the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of star players on both teams, of course you have two essentially late-round draft picks in Jokic, a second-rounder, the 41st pick, and Jimmy at the end of the first round as the 30th pick. I think that's a great story for basketball fans everywhere."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Coach Spoelstra and Malone, you have two of the coaches with the longest longevity in the league. Erik has the second-longest tenure and Michael the fourth-longest tenure. A lot to be said there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Again, and just the markets, two roughly around the same mid-sized markets in the league, I think that's intriguing, too. I think it speaks a lot to the competitiveness in this league and the fact that we've come up with a system now, working closely with the Players Association and all the teams, where I like to think every team in this league has a shot to compete for a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We saw in this season in particular, it was a record with roughly just a little over a week left in the season, you had 26 teams still competing for the Playoffs. As I said, that's a record."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,He's somebody who everyone here -- I know many of you in the media knew him well and was someone I got to spend an enormous amount of time with over my 30-plus years with the league. Just wanted to mark his passing again and his impact on the league.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Lastly, I'll say that I appreciate the amount of international coverage of those who traveled to be here in the Finals. I know it's not an easy trip when the cities, of course, aren't known until relative last minute. But these games will be carried in 214 countries and territories and 60 different languages. And on top of that, we continue to have an enormous, measured in billions of followers globally on social media."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"There's tremendous anticipation for these Finals. And with that, happy to answer any questions anyone has."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, I think there's enormous benefit. I get the question asked, too, sort of the converse of that question is are dynasties good for the league. My ultimate view is competition is great for the league, and if as a result dynasties are made, I think that's great, too. So I'm not against seeing repeat championships."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"On the other hand, whoever wins this year it'll be the fifth consecutive year where we have a new team winning a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We decided that given that investigation was ongoing and it remains ongoing, that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to work in these Finals. I don't know what the ultimate conclusion will be. We'll see where the facts take us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"So in assessing what discipline is appropriate, if that's the case, we look at both the history of prior acts, but then we look at the individual player's history, as well. And the seriousness, of course, of the conduct. Those are all things that get factored."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,It's not an exact science. It comes down to judgment at the end of the day on the part of me and my colleagues in the league office.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"In terms of the timing, we've uncovered a fair amount of additional information, I think, since I was first asked about the situation. I will say we probably could have brought it to a head now, but we made the decision, and I believe the Players Association agrees with us, that it would be unfair to these players and these teams in the middle of the series to announce the results of that investigation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Given that we're of course in the offseason, he has now been suspended by the Memphis Grizzlies indefinitely, so nothing would have changed anyway in the next few weeks. It seemed better to park that at the moment, at least any public announcement, and my sense now is that shortly after the conclusion of the Finals we will announce the outcome of that investigation."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think, ultimately, progress has been so slow based on something that Stan Kroenke himself said to me even back more than a year ago, which is the situation here has been a bit of the canary in the mine in terms of the breakdown of the regional sports network model."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Of course what followed then, this impasse, was ultimately the bankruptcy of the so-called Diamond RSNs, 16 others. It's a terrible situation. The league office has tried to mediate several times between the parties. It's a commercial dispute. There hasn't been a simple resolution to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I know there's no doubt it's bad for fans, of course, and the team recognizes that. It's my hope, though, and one of the things that's changed considerably since this dispute has started is the advent of many more streaming platforms, better digital streaming technology."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"As we now embark on our negotiations for our new what we used to call our national deals, we have two years left with our existing partners -- I think Bill Koenig is here, our president of media -- it's a problem we have to fix."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I hope this is a period we look back on, as we say, where we went through a transition, and we got to a place where a fan, frankly, wherever they are can watch every game. Most likely it'll be through some sort of digital offering. When you think about those digital platforms, there's obviously no constraint in terms of individual channels and everything else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"It frustrates me because I think it's a broken economic model where you have demand and the supply isn't there, especially with a leading No. 1 seed team, Finals-caliber team here in Denver, the notion that local fans can't watch the games -- I have, incidentally, a brother who lives in Boulder, so I hear from him and his family all the time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,It makes no sense. It's on us to fix it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I'll rephrase your question. If that had been in effect this season, most of those players would, in fact, have been eligible for those awards. We're putting in place an incentive for players to play more games in the regular season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"There's no magic to the 65, but we're trying to take into account games, of course, that are going to be missed because there are injuries, and maybe occasionally even it's necessary for a player to rest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think, again, this is something we negotiated with the Players Association. Everybody has an interest in the league putting its best foot forward in a highly competitive regular season. That provision plus some others -- I think the Play-In, incidentally, had a huge impact at the end of the season. We're adding an In-Season Tournament."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We're hoping those various provisions plus, frankly, talking more about it as partners with the players, that people will understand that, especially to that earlier question about media, it's a changing media landscape, higher expectations from our fans, different pricing models for fans receiving games, that we're all going to have to play through the long grind, as Coach Spoelstra called it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But again, finding that right balance. That's why it's 65, not 75, because recognize players are going to get injured. And it may be that even if a player has been injured and is out for a significant number of games, we've all come to the conclusion that that player is just not eligible then, therefore, for those level awards."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I have enormous level of empathy. I wouldn't say it's concern, because when you look at the numbers, it's actually not that aberrational. You've been doing this a long time, too, David."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,There is that revolving door of coaches. What's interesting is some of those same championship coaches have already been hired on other teams. So it's a marketplace.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But again, I think that's something that ultimately has to be controlled by the teams. I am, though, just personally, because I've been at this a long time and they're personal friends, and I think sometimes I get it from a team or a fan standpoint you're doing everything you can to win, it's rough to get fired. It's rough on that coach's family. It requires dislocation. It's embarrassing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But the good news is seemingly the great coaches, the ones that have proven track records, get rehired somewhere else. I don't think they go from being championship-level coaches to bad coaches one or two seasons later. For whatever reason change is just necessary, a different voice. We all know how that works."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,But the good news is it seems that talent continues to get recognized and the great coaches get rehired somewhere else.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I'll just give you the other side of the coin, that all really a salary cap is is a mechanism for distributing the players' share of the total revenue. So in this case, and I think the coaches would take this deal any day of the week, the players receive roughly 50 percent of the gross revenue of this league. It's a formula we call BRI, but that's essentially how it works."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"As you know, there's all kinds of complexity to the salary cap system. But in essence, you take their 50 percent share and you divide it by 30, and that's the salary cap."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"While it has the word ""cap"" as part of it, it's misleading in that it's really a sharing mechanism. And what's so great about the system, one that I inherited and take no credit for, is it also creates maximum incentives because when we sit and we're negotiating with the Players Association, we see new opportunities -- take the Play-In or an In-Season Tournament -- they're our partners, and 50 percent of the revenue that we generate from those new activities then go to the players. It just gets expressed through the salary cap."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I pay attention to it, but it's a marketplace. We're able to negotiate collectively with the players because they choose to negotiate as a union. The coaches don't -- haven't made that election. They could form a union and come and negotiate their agreements collectively, but in the marketplace for coaches, we compete -- our teams compete individually, and it's where the marketplace takes us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think you could say it doesn't seem right as a societal matter, but this is a marketplace and it's a business. I don't think it's different than comparing teachers to bankers. We could go down the list, or journalists to players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We as the NBA made a decision, again, David Stern made that decision, to create the WNBA, to fund it at enormous cost, and we continue to support that league. But ultimately I think the women who play in that league would be the first to say they are not a charity. The goal is to turn this into a sustainable, independent business."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"The great news is that our commissioner, Cathy Engelbert, together with a strong Players Association, a fantastic group of women playing in that league, have made tremendous progress, particularly in the last few years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We saw record ratings for this draft that just passed, for this early game so far on ESPN, record ratings on CBS, as well. It's happening. It takes a long time. But I would only say we contribute an enormous amount, both in resources and actual dollars, to that league, and hopefully just as the NBA and certain other sports have grown over time, women's basketball will continue to grow, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, I think it's tremendous that the international players are committed to their countries. I think there's -- especially in terms of World Cup competition, they grew up in different traditions. Obviously, there's the World Cup of futbol, slash, soccer, it has a very meaning to them in terms of World Cup. I think we've seen Americans are more focused on Olympic competition. I think you've seen the commitment from our very best to compete in the Olympics and in certain cycles the World Cup, and not just once but multiple times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Frankly, if it were up to me, I would take one of those competitions, similar to what they've done in soccer, for example, where I think it's essentially 23-and-under for Olympic competition. I think it's too much to create the expectation that every two years that our best players are going back out and competing independently in the summer. Putting aside load management for a second, there's no question there's enormous wear and tear. It goes to the WNBA question about those women playing year-round. Their bodies just can't -- you need a rest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think here we should work with our federation ultimately, and whether it be the World Cup or whether it be the Olympics, maybe have one where it's unlimited in terms of age and your very best play, and then the other competition is one where your very best under 23 or something like that compete, and once you've done it, then their expectation is that you continue to compete."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"The other issue, of course, is international. There's just not as large a pool in many countries for that competition, too, so I think it's just that some of our international players have grown up literally as brothers with some of these players, so I think there's -- I wouldn't call it peer pressure. It's nationalism, too. But I think it's just an expectation that they're going to be out there competing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, one, I'm not going to speak for Michael Jordan. I never will. So, I'll let him answer a question what his current status is. I'd only say that just in the same way that it's wonderful that one of our greatest, Michael Jordan, could become the principal governor of a team, he has the absolute right to sell at the same time. Values have gone up a lot since he bought that team, so that is his decision."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"While he is our only principal African American owner right now, over the years, whether it's Grant Hill who's come in, David Robinson, Shaquille O'Neal owning a piece of the Atlanta Hawks -- I'm sorry, Sacramento Kings for Shaquille O'Neal. That's ongoing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I would love to have better representation in terms of principal governors. It's a marketplace. It's something that if we were expanding that the league would be in a position to focus directly on that, but in individual team transactions, the market takes us where we are."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I will say I know that increasingly our governors are focused on diversity in their ownership groups just as they are in their front office, so the trend lines have been positive over the last several years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I've thought about that, and Joe Dumars, who is here, was in the room with me when we met with Ja, and he's known Ja longer than I have. For me at the time, an eight-game suspension seemed very serious, and the conversation we had, and Tamika Tremaglio from the Players Association was there, as well, felt heartfelt and serious."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,But I think he understood that it wasn't about his words. It was going to be about his future conduct.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I guess in hindsight, I don't know. If it had been a 12-game suspension instead of an eight-game suspension, would that have mattered? I know it seemed based on precedent, and he's represented, and we want to be fair in terms of the league, it seemed appropriate at the time. That's all I can say. Maybe by definition to the extent we've all seen the video that it appears he's done it again, I guess you could say maybe not."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But I don't think we yet know what it will take to change his behavior. Same thing I said at the time he seems to be a fine young man. In terms of my dealings with him, I think he's clearly made some mistakes, but he's young, and I'm hoping now -- once we conclude at the end of our process what the appropriate discipline is, that it's not just about the discipline, it's about now what we, the Players Association, his team and he and the people around him are going to do to create better circumstances going forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,I think that's ultimately what's most important here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Yes, there's been discussion to the extent that's an issue that came up from the moment we put in place the structure. Again, you have the example here, right, we all talk about Miami Heat is the eighth seed, but they started as the seventh seed, and when they went to the Play-In, they lost the first game. And some of you may recall, I think they were down to the Chicago Bulls with less than three minutes to go in the second game. They ended up as the eighth seed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think from our standpoint, it's worked. I'm always, though -- I've acknowledged to the extent we should tweak certainly new things we put in place, we will. I think I'd rather have a few more seasons under our belt before we make additional changes, so right now it's something we're open to new ideas and discussion, but we think it's working pretty well right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,I'm not going to answer that yet. I think let's wait and see what the conclusion is of our investigation.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Well, it hasn't just been discussion, we've dramatically reduced the number of back-to-backs. We've eliminated four games in five nights -- that used to be a regularity in this league, and now we're down to math."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"I think it's the trade-off. Recall two seasons ago we played a 72-game season. In a way, it's not a perfect experiment because coming off the COVID season, so it was condensed in a way that -- as if we had changed and taken 10 games off the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But at least from that season-long experiment, it didn't change resting patterns all that much, and it didn't change injury patterns all that much. There is an economic factor, of course, that's being balanced in terms of playing a longer season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"What's interesting is that what we saw this year maybe surprised some, was all-time record attendance, more people attended NBA games than any time in our history. So clearly our fans aren't saying reduce the number of games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Ultimately, to me, as the science gets better on injuries, if we had better data that suggested a shorter season and fewer back to backs would make a significant difference, I think we would take that seriously."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Of course, the other issue other than the reducing the number of games, you could lengthen the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"But I think, again, in talking to our teams and our players, one, it is already -- when you think of when training camp starts, essentially the end of September, and here we are almost in late June, so we're all still in the same season, plus you want to get in a Summer League for the incoming players, the players also want that chunk of time off on their bodies. That's what we didn't see when we were coming out of the Bubble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"It's just something we're constantly balancing. But we're always open as we learn more, and I think that AI is yet -- will add a new component to better understanding the data around injuries."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Remember with AI you can also digest video. And I think probably in the not far too distant future when a player tears his ACL, they're going to go back over multiple years and instantaneously through AI analyze the movement that that player was making with his left knee or whatever and conclude whether there was some indicia of something that if only the player were strengthening some muscle or something else could have avoided that injury."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"Hopefully with all this new technology, we're going to keep our players on the floor longer and we won't need to modify the schedule."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's something that we've been working on, just bouncing back after runs, timeouts locking back in. So, I thought we did a good job of just executing after they went on runs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Because we have a big goal in mind. You can't dwell on the negative. If they're playing well, you've got to just do better and be in a better mindset to do it. You can't hang your head every timeout."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, I thought we did a good job after timeouts just coming in locked in. No matter what they do, just executing, and playing the way we play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,Yeah. Thank you for asking.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he's done amazing. Just like playing an all-around game, 12 boards, 14 points with basically one or two threes, getting to the rim, playing great defense, pursuing the ball. He's 6-10, he's doing more than just knocking down shots, and that's dangerous. When he's doing that, he's helping us a lot just being on the wing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Even if he's not shooting well, he's going to keep shooting and we're going to keep finding him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"That's just the way he plays the game. If the team is rolling, that's just how you play basketball. If everybody else is scoring, then there's no need to force it. He's a great passer, great facilitator. They're digging, they're doubling, they're trying not to let him score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, he's just playing the game and other guys are playing well. That's just the way he plays. Just let the game kind of come to him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, he's a heavy guy. He's going to get boards and rebound the ball and just be physical down there regardless. Even if he's not shooting well or not scoring well, he's still a load down there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just playing the game. Whoever is open, whoever has the mismatch, that's just the way we play. If it's not Jokic, it's AG set the tone today. Sometimes I set the tone. Sometimes K is setting the tone. It could be anybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"I thought AG just did a good job of making an adjustment early in the game, just being tough down there and just being relentless. I think that set the tone for us to start the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I think we do a good job defensively just flying around, being on a string, not just tonight but all playoffs, all season. You can't be the No. 1 seed with just offense. That's hard to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Jokic has great hands down there. KCP is aggressive. Bruce is one of the best defenders. AG is one of the best defenders. So, we've got a lot of guys -- CB, we don't think he's a rookie. So, we've got a lot of guys that can come in and impact the game on defense and do a lot better than you think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, absolutely. Like I said, we're just reading the game. If they take the pocket away, we're looking somewhere else. If they take me away, then we're looking somewhere else. We're just trying to find the open man, find the best shot, find the mismatch. I think we do that throughout the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, it's hard to guard everybody, instead of just one or two guys. We make you have to be locked in on defense throughout the game. I think tonight was just a great example of it could be anybody's night and anybody's quarter, maybe not your quarter. That's just Nuggets basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just ball movement. Playing Nuggets basketball. That's just the way we play. Find the open man, hit the open man, take the open shot. I think we do a good job of just keeping the ball hopping, and during our offense it doesn't get stagnant. It's tough to guard, like I said, everybody instead of just one or two guys, and that's why the guys are getting open shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Hard worker, loves basketball, dedicated. I don't think he gets enough credit for how well he's played through, how many injuries he's been through. We were out together for a while, and just to see him bounce back, every time that he's been hurt, I think he's pretty impressive. He's only getting better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Shout-out to Mike. He's done a great job just having an all-around game. Even when he's not shooting the ball well, he's impacting the game in different ways. We going to need more of that. He's done a great job, not just this game but all year, of impacting the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,I think we're doing a good job.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was cool. Finals, Eastern Conference, first round, second round, we just want to win a championship, doesn't matter what series. I think it's just fluent, beautiful basketball. The ball is hopping and we're just playing off each other. You can have a great game with only five shots until the fourth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just making reads on the basketball court. I think that's the beauty of what this team is, we have so many different weapons and so many different looks, like I said, you've got to guard to everybody. Jokic dominated until the fourth quarter, and it didn't even feel like it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it's free flowing, and it's a lot of fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, a lot of confidence. We had eight new guys come to this team at the start of the year. I thought we did a great job of building the chemistry and continuity of how we want to play, and everybody is buying in, and you could see it's paying off if we just play the right way, everybody stay patient, you're going to get good looks, get good shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Our core has been playing like this for years, from Mike to me, to Jokic, Mike, we've been doing this for a while. Our timing is great, and our pace is great, so I think it's just almost natural, the way we play. Our reads, it's not a stagnant offense, it's not a set offense. If somebody else is open, we play it through. It's nice to make reads like that during the game instead of just running a set play and just kind of just go through the motions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, this did a great job of just junking up the game -- zone, press, man, double, no double. We knew they were going to do that. That's how they play and that's how they win games, is just be relentless in that sense. They had that 8-0 run to start the fourth, and we just locked back in and took care of the ball and found the best shot. I think once we do that, once we play the way we play, it doesn't really matter what the other team does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, a lot of the focus is on ourselves and not turning the ball over and giving them one shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, those are sets. We're making reads. Like I said, we're just making reads. If I'm not open, somebody else is open if I cut."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just making reads, playing basketball, and had nine days off, so got to show off my little left leg over there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"The number of people that I've heard from in this run has been incredible, from high school teammates, college teammates, coaches, as you mentioned. Most people have an opinion, and everybody wants a ticket. I give them the 1-800 ticket number."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,But it's been really neat to hear from coaches that have had an impact on my career and probably -- my father being the number one. It's been since game one of year one all the way up until this point.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So when I hear from, yes, my father, Brendan Malone, but also guys like Gregg Popovich and other coaches that you've come across in many years, even my high school coach Bobby Farrell, that means a lot. I think people are proud of the journey and they all understand that we have a lot of work in front of us, and we're not satisfied."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But when you get to a stage like this, people that are reaching out, it does mean a lot, and I am thankful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I'm not really sure in terms of Jamal's stats over the last few years against Miami. I know we as a team have had good stats against Miami, which is the most important thing. It's the collective and not the individual."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"We know they're a very good defensive team. We know, more than Minnesota, Phoenix and L.A., we're going to see a lot more different types of defenses, things that we've worked on the last few days."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But one thing I do know about Jamal, if he has a bad game or somebody is doing something to take him out of his game, he's going to figure it out. I think in just these 15 games that we've played in this postseason, I think we've seen that quite a few times in each round."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Teams think they've kind of figured him out or an individual defender may think they've figured him out, and then Jamal will just go into a 23-point fourth quarter or score 30 points in the first half, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,I have all the confidence in the world that Jamal is going to be ready for this stage.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's been the constant, from that first Summer League in Vegas up until today. You could tell early on that he had a very good feel for the game, a high IHe was not only a willing passer, but I think he's always taken more joy in making plays for his teammates than he does for himself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whether he was maybe not in the best shape of his life or he got in peak conditioning, that never changed. I think that's kind of the one constant."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's really funny, I was hanging out with one of my daughters last night, and she said, Are you nervous? And I said, You know what's really funny? I'm not. I said, I think the reason that I'm not nervous is because I know we're prepared."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"It is accurate. I was jealous because every time I saw the Heat staff, they had like three or four bottles of wine. They were sitting in the middle of one of the little lakes there in our detention center."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then there's this loop around where we were, and every night like me and Spo would run into each other. I would be on my bike, he would be walking and we'd get to talking to each other. We were in Africa together for one of the BWB trips. We have a relationship. We have a respect for each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Obviously you look at his body of work and his career, I think most coaches would aspire to do, accomplish what Erik has accomplished."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Lasting image, yeah. Eighty-three days in the bubble away from family, away from friends, and probably I think the biggest thing I can take away from being in the bubble was just how proud I was of our group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you recall, we were down 3-1, not just the first round, but the second round. A lot of people have said since the bubble ended that they just wanted to get the hell out of there. And our guys had ample opportunity to let go of the rope and say, Man, I am tired of this, I want to go home. Especially down 3-1. They never did that. They stayed the course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That to me was so impressive to be a part of a group that believed, never gave up and fought its way to a Western Conference Finals. Just how proud I was of that group is probably what I take more than anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I do it often. It's funny, when you're a young coach, you're always trying to learn from other people and other great coaches and take things from them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I remember reading something about Pat Riley, and he talked how he would quiz his players often. You think the main reason you're quizzing them is to see if they are locked in, focused and paying attention. That's part of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I thought the second part of Pat Riley's reasoning for doing that was really -- what stuck with me is that it also allows you to see if you're doing your job as a coach. If they don't know the answers, you've failed, not just them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"It is something that, being around Jeff Van Gundy, being around coaches throughout my career, quizzing them, keeping them on their toes, keeping them sharp, making sure they're locked in. And at this stage, we can't be spoon-feeding guys. They have to take accountability and ownership for themselves. That's why I said this morning our guys were pretty impressive because every question that I asked was answered with a correct answer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, we're going to find out. It's going to be one of two things. They have tremendous rhythm. They played a seven-game Eastern Conference championship. We've had 10 days off."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the 10 days, we've tried to be really smart with giving guys a break, with the delicate balance of, while giving them a break mentally and physically, also making sure we're conditioned and maintaining our rhythm as best as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,You can't replicate game rhythm without playing a game. We tried to do the best job we could do. So we're going to find out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Going into the first round against Minnesota we had the same thing, like a week to get ready, not knowing who we were playing. Our guys attacked that week with the same voracity as we did this past week."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,I expect our guys to be fully ready to go out there and be excited to play in front of the best fans in the world.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's where your principles come into play. When you have principles that you believe in and you bring to work every day, regardless of the result, regardless of the outcome, based on that result, you can go home that night and know you did the best job to the best of your ability."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"You're right, in this last month or so you see the guys that have gotten fired and their achievements and their track record. I can't say it's surprising. I grew up in this business. I saw my father get fired. I've been fired. It's kind of something that you know is going to happen at some point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think for me, it's staying true to yourself and not compromising yourself ever. And if you do that, I think your body of work will speak for itself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Like Monty Williams. Good friend. Congratulations. I've got to hit him up, I need a loan. But Monty is doing all right for himself. He got fired in Phoenix. Okay, well, Detroit realized here's a guy that is not only a great coach but more importantly he's going to be a great example for our team and help a bunch of young players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that's all you want. If it doesn't work out in one place, you know that 29 other teams are watching to see maybe that guy could work here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I'll say on this is, and I have to say it because it's true, for me, I've been very fortunate. Tim Connelly hired me and Josh and Stan Kroenke have believed in me since day one and have allowed me to get to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Most coaches don't get eight years. Right now it's Pop, it's Spo, it's Steve Kerr and myself. The fact that I'm one of the top four longest-tenured coaches, that has a ton to do with where we are today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I couldn't be more thankful for working for an ownership group that is not impatient and is not trying to find the next great thing, but, hey, listen, let's let this grow and marinate into something special. I've benefited from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think it's a really interesting question. For Nikola, starting with him, that's probably the thing I marvel at most is over eight years, how consistently great he has been. For him to do it every single night, that is a talent. That is a skill that only historically great players are able to do every night, bring that greatness."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, to be averaging a triple-double in the NBA Playoffs heading into the Finals, I think only a few guys named Wilt and Magic have done that in the past. So he's up there with the greatest players of all time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"And with Jamal, I think the last time we saw this was when we were in the bubble. That was the last Playoffs he participated in prior to this year. For Jamal, it just seems like as the stakes get higher and the stage gets bigger, he embraces that. He doesn't shy away from that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think more than anything, it's a mentality. It's an inner belief and a confidence that they have in themselves and their teammates, and they go out there and continue to show and prove every single night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's why I'm just so excited to watch our team in these Finals. We know it's going to be the hardest challenge of our lives. KCP is the only world champion on our team, and hopefully in the next couple of weeks we can find a way to bring the first championship here to Denver."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, there were a lot of things that I liked. To hold that team to 93 points, only 40 from the field, 33 from the three-point line, which is below their 39 percent in the Playoffs, and probably the most impressive defensive stat was only two free throw attempts. I think we got there 20 times. We know Jimmy Butler is one of the best in the business at getting to the foul line, so two free throw attempts. I thought our guys did a great job of defending without fouling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, I thought for three quarters, our defense was where it needed to be. Fourth quarter, 60 percent allowed, 30 points, and I think as I told our players, we're up 1-0, that's great, but we have to close games out. We're up 21 to start that fourth quarter, and they open up with a quick 8-0 run, turnover, layup. We missed a few open shots against the zone, gave up some threes. In the Finals you can't pick and choose when you want to play. We've got to play much closer to 48 minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"That was one of my last messages to the group before our game. I reminded our group, if they didn't know that Miami went into Milwaukee and won Game 1. They went into the Garden in New York City and won Game 1. They won Game 1 up in Boston. So, we did not want them coming in here taking control of the series on our court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Proud of our guys for going out there and getting the win. Michael Porter, a double-double. Jamal Murray, double-double. Nikola, triple-double. I felt Aaron Gordon's play on both ends of the floor in that first half really set the tone, and I thought Bruce was really good off the bench."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"This was everybody stepping up, doing their job, but knowing that we can all be a lot better come Sunday."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think Aaron -- we always talk about Nikola embodying Nuggets culture, and I think Aaron Gordon is a prime example of somebody who's truly selfless. He understood with Jamal and Michael coming back this year being healthy that his role was going to change. He never once fought it. He's embraced it from day one of the season and gone out there, whether it's guarding Karl-Anthony Towns, Kevin Durant, LeBron James, and now obviously guarding a guy like Jimmy Butler. He does a lot of the dirty work for us, and a lot of times he doesn't get the credit that he deserves."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"They were switching early on and I felt he was really big in terms of sitting down in front of the rim, scoring in the paint and finishing at the rim. And again, just his effort on the defensive end was just another example of his importance to our group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, you've got to read the game. If you're giving up tough mid-range contested twos, that's better than them getting a lot of open threes. Obviously, we can do a better job of contesting some of those mid-range shots that Bam was getting, and I think we have to mix up our levels. To your point, Kyle Lowry, Gabe Vincent, they hit a couple of pull-up threes. I was imploring our guys, imploring Nikola to be up higher. When you do that, now Bam gets behind you and you have to trust your low man and trust your weak-side help. In that fourth quarter, I felt once we were at the level, I thought we had some pretty good examples of helping on that roll and disrupting their offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, as I said earlier, I felt Aaron really kind of set the tone on both ends of the floor for us. He's done that all year long, whether it's in transition versus a cross match sitting down posting up a smaller guy, sealing him in the paint, going up strong. They switched a few of the pick-and-rolls early, sitting down, posting up, finding him. And then giving us a great defensive effort against arguably one of the best players in the NBA right now in Jimmy Butler."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"We're a team and give Bam Adebayo credit. He did a really good job of making Nikola's catches hard. He fronted him a lot in that first quarter throughout the game. So, we needed other guys to step up. If you're going to take away Nikola, then find a way to get somebody else open and let them get off, and Aaron obviously benefitted from that and did a hell of a job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I really wasn't, and the reason I say that is because end of the regular season and before we played Game 1, Round 1 against Minnesota, we had the same thing, we had like a week to get ready. For much of that week, like this series, we didn't know who we were playing. But our guys were so locked in going into that Game 1 and I felt since we got back to practice after that Lakers series, our guys have been the same way, man. They've been so locked in. Every day in practice, I haven't had to push them, encourage them. They're bringing it. Tonight, obviously was great to see after such a long break, getting off to the start that we did."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's the beauty of Nikola. I learned a long time ago the defense tells you what to do, and Nikola never forces it. If they're going to give him that kind of attention, he had 10 assists at halftime, I believe. Well, he's going to just pick you apart. Now it's up to the other guys to step in and make shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it was the fourth quarter, we got into the bonus early. I was trying to post him up, get him the ball, tried to screen Bam, so he could catch the ball in a scoring area and let Nikola do what he does."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, I think that's -- Nikola never tries to impose his will or force things that aren't there. He's going to read the game. He's going to make the right play. Most importantly he's going to make every one of his teammates better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I don't think he cares if he scored 27 points or not. He cares that we're up 1-0. I think everybody in that locker room realizes that yes, we need Nikola, but Michael Porter's double-double, Jamal's double-double, Bruce's 10 and 5 off the bench. This is a team. We have some really talented players, but we need everybody in that locker room to do their jobs, to try to go and get game No. 2 on Sunday night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yes, I can't bail them out every time. I called a timeout after the 8-0 run in the third. I called a few in the fourth, but at some point, also our guys have to take ownership. If you're going to win a championship, you need the five guys on the floor to step up, take accountability and make sure we execute and get the best shot on offense and get stops defensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To our guys' credit, they cut it but we were able to withstand that and wind up pulling away."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, it's where it needs to be. I think we're past the point of praising Michael when he has a good defensive game. He needs to, as does everybody else on our team. This is the NBA Finals. We showed one of those at halftime where they ran a pick-and-roll for Jimmy Butler, Michael tried to get under, stayed in the play and wound up blocking Jimmy from behind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So those are the plays that Michael and everybody else needs to play for us to win this series. It can't be like, hey, look at Michael Porter, he's doing a great job. That is his job, and it's Jamal's job and Pope's job and Nikola, Aaron and everybody else that plays for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"I don't know if it's like -- he's even aware of that. Like I don't think he gets up more for Game 1 than Game 2. I think it speaks to 7 to 10 days in between games. I think that allowed us to get some quality rest mentally, physically, emotionally and get ready for tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"As I said pregame, I wasn't sure what was going to happen when the game started, because we had such a long break. But I'm not surprised that Jamal had the game that he had. He got us going early, made big shots late. And when you have 26 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, that's a hell of a performance in your first game of the NBA Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,Their run was to be expected. That team is a really good team. That's the best team out of the Eastern Conference. So you're not just going to win by 20 points and they're not going to go quietly into that good night. They're going to be there. They're going to scratch and claw to get back in the game like they did tonight.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I fully expected that. They're a well-coached team, and they're here for a reason. We knew they'd make a run, and what's it going to take on Sunday night? They're going to come out and try to jump all over us and take control of the series and that game early on, and we have to be ready for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"We did Gave it to Aaron Gordon. I made the point that when you hold a team in the NBA Finals to 93 points, 40 from the field, 33 from the three-point line and only two free throw attempts, could have given it to the whole team tonight. I thought a lot of guys had really good defensive games, taking away that fourth quarter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"So yes, Aaron got it. I thought he did a hell of a job taking on that challenge of guarding a guy like Jimmy Butler, but I felt as a group, a collective unit, I felt our guys did a hell of a job, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,KYLE LOWRY,We fought. The second half was a lot smoother for us. We played a little bit better. We found a little bit of rhythm and we got great shots.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,KYLE LOWRY,I think we just played a little bit harder. A little bit more attention to detail.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,KYLE LOWRY,Same thing. But I am going to take my dinner and chill out for a couple days.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, to be honest, I couldn't wait to start just because when the game started it felt abnormal. Everything else didn't feel -- felt abnormal, and the whole media day yesterday or the day before, it was -- I think people are making something bigger than it is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, exactly. I don't force it. I never force it, I think. It was a couple guys had it going, AG was playing really good, and we had advantage there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,I just take whatever the game gives me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, that's what they're doing. That's why they're great. They're really intelligent. Everybody knows what they are doing. That's a hard team to beat because they keep playing the same way the whole game, and they're really, really smart about how they're doing it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He didn't ask me nothing, so I don't know. I think we did a good job, but guys were focused on how it was supposed to be. We were really, really focused and locked into the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Oh, I love to play with him. I love to play with some -- I want to say dominant big men, if that makes any sense. But he's really -- the best thing he did is accepting his role, and he's really doing a great job of that. Like today he got it going. We were just getting him the ball, and he was really good in the paint today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He's our best defender probably, him and KCP, and just to play defense the whole game on the best player, I think that's really hard to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we are playing that way -- I am playing with Jamal that way a long time ago. I think everybody kind of -- I think they like it just because they are touching the ball. It's not like you just catch and shoot. I think to have the opportunity to touch the ball, to do something with it, to take advantage, create an advantage. I think we are playing a really nice brand of basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He had a couple of mid-range shots. I think he was supposed to make that. He's shooting the ball really well, and we all want him to shoot those kind of shots. He's really good at mid-range. He's really good at threes, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But as long as he's -- I think the whole Playoffs, he's playing really well, and creating for himself and for his teammates really nice looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't say that. I said we're playing good brand of basketball, not beautiful and not great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That's how I learned to play basketball, and I think it's really nice to play -- it's really hard to guard when you don't know who's going to attack and how to defend when everybody is moving, everybody is doing something. I think it's a really nice brand of basketball that we have, and everybody buys in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I'm not sure that I did that for us or whatever, but I think everybody contributed and everybody accepted it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Uh-uh. I mean, no. We have veterans doing a really good job and they are really pointing the main things. If you listen to them, it's really smart what they are saying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, that's a really good sentence about him. Really good, actually. I agree with that. Just because he's everything, what he's doing, it's aggressive, defensively, offensively. He's a champion. He won a couple things before coming here, so he knows what to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,That's a really good sentence. We don't look at him as a rookie.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Mike was 2-for-11, and I thought he made like seven threes. Crazy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, that's going to help us, especially the way, how they're attacking the glass, Bam, Jimmy, and to be on everybody, even Caleb Martin. Even Lowry he's always hanging out trying to steal some rebounds. But he's a big body, and he can help us on the glass, both sides."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Yeah. I mean, it's equal opportunity for the most part. But we're going through big fella. So big fella makes the right play, makes the right read, and he's just so smart, he's so cerebral out there, such a floor general, and Mal is floor general, too. If you make the right read or make the right cut or set the right screen, you're going to be open, and the ball moves, the ball finds the open man. The open man is the right play, and that's how we play the game, and it's a fun way to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Well, it's really a team effort. I think the Defensive Player of the Game could have gone to Michael Porter, too. He really stepped up on the defensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,We're switching a lot. Everybody is helping. We're shrinking. We're stunting for the stunter. It's not just a one-on-one game. I've been saying that all week. It's a team effort to slow that guy Jimmy Butler down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I'm not here for the credit. I'm here for the wins. Playing with guys like the guys that are on this team is just a blessing. It's a beautiful opportunity to play with guys on the team that have so much talent, have so much skill and have so much passion for the game of basketball. That's what I've always loved is to play the right way of basketball, and we do that here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I don't care if I score 50 or 0, as long as I'm helping impact the game and we're winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Not yet. Not yet. I'm definitely going to be sitting in my rocking chair when I'm 79, 90 years old, talking to my kids like, back in the day I locked these guys up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"It's just part of the game. I'm doing what my team needs me to do, and like I said, it's a team effort. It always is. It takes five guys out there to play a complete defense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"No, this is just Denver Nugget basketball. We find a mismatch, we exploit it, and we keep going to it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,I was just taking what the defense was giving me and just attacking what I felt was a mismatch.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Loved his pace tonight, just the pace that he played all night long, the tempo that he played at, controlling the game and controlling the flow of the game was great. His timely shot-making and his distribution of the basketball was very important, very crucial for this win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Well, you've got to want it, first and foremost. A lot of guys don't really care about the defensive side of the floor. Just effort, the want, the energy. That's where it starts."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Then after that, it takes knowing the personnel, and then it takes technique."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Mike played an incredible game tonight. Just so well rounded and so balanced. Affected the game in so many different areas, and he's just getting better and better on the defensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Oh, most definitely. He's a force down there, and he's just more athletic than people give him credit for, and he just has a ridiculous motor. He has a motor that just doesn't quit. It's tough guarding a guy like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"It was awesome. The crowd was super cool tonight. It was just like -- it was beautiful. I took a moment during the National Anthem was like wow, this is really the NBA Finals, and it's really, really cool. The crowd was in it from the start, giving us that extra juice. They've been awesome all year, and they just turned it up another notch."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, it's just an exciting brand of basketball. It's a lot of fun out there just to be battling with my guys. Yeah, winning is always fun, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"No, I think I was pretty prepared. I was really excited, but it was very fun out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"No, just taking advantage of my physicality out there. Like I said, just taking what the defense was giving me and just trying to put my head down and get to the cup, avoid charges, and just really set the tone for our team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,Most definitely. You've got to play to your advantages at this time of year and all the time. I was just looking to play to my advantages.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I think it's a standard that we hold ourselves to and that we have held ourselves to all year long. We've been building habits day in and day out. So, you get to a game like this, the biggest stage in basketball, you let your standard of play and you let your habits carry you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"We don't want to change too much. We want to go back to the film and look where we can get better. If we're looking to improve, I think we're in a good place."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I was surprised. I was like, whoa, my man got VertiMax, man. Not the usual dunk. But Jamal is like a sleepy athlete. He will dunk you for real. That was crazy. It was like, yeah, all vert."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"Well, Blue Arrow is one of the best guards in the league and one of the best scorers in the league. He has a way about him, he has a discipline about him that when he's locked in, when he's engaged, he's up there with the best players in the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Felt great. I think everybody felt great. Missed some shots, didn't get back a little bit, but overall I feel like everybody's wind was good. Everybody was moving well. We just lost the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, they are a physical group. I think we had to adjust to their physicality early, especially myself. They had a couple lay-ups on me early that we had to adjust to. But, you know, it's a long series, first to four wins, adjustments will be made, and we'll learn from this loss."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, I've got a lot of hair on my head so my head is doing all right, thankfully."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,But they are a good team. They are well-coached. They are talented. It's going to be a challenge. It's the Finals. We don't expect it any other way. We are looking forward to Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I definitely think they came out with a lot of physicality, and we have to be able to match that. They did their job on their home floor, you have to say that, but we will be ready. Like he said, we will adjust, and we will do some things very differently and come out here and be ready to give more for Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Probably because we shot a lot of jumpshots, myself probably leading that pack, instead of putting pressure on the rim, getting lay-ups, getting to the free throw line. When you look at it during the game, they all look like the right shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"And I'm not saying that we can't as a team make those, but got to get more layups, got to get more free throws. And whenever you miss and don't get back, the game gets out of hand kind of quickly. We gave up too many lay-ups which we also can't have happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"But that's it as a whole. We've got to attack the rim a lot more, myself included."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I think we are always trying to find Bam, and the way they guard, he tended to be open with some of our sets a bit, and he made some good reads tonight, and he made some shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,He's aggressive. We're going to need him to continue to be aggressive and continue to attack and continue to make the right reads for us.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I agree. When Bam is making shots, I think he makes everybody's job a lot easier. We want him to continually be aggressive, and he was making, you know, the right passes when he couldn't get a bucket, as well, and those shots will fall for everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Next game, stay with it and keep playing that style of basketball. But in the end, if we guard better, not give up so many layups, get back, I think the game is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,He's comfortable and confident. He shoots the ball very well. He cuts to the rim. He guards. He does anything and everything that you ask him to do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"Tonight he spaced the floor incredibly well. He had some timely cuts, some stops, some hustle plays. And that's what made his mark in this league for him, and he's continuing to do it, even in the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"I mean, he's talented. He's an MVP. He's going to make plays. He's going to be great at times. We just have to continue to make it difficult, be physical with him when we can, like we mentioned, take away the layups and try to take away these cuts and attack him on offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think it was a focus in Game 1. Obviously it will be a focus in Game 2 as well. We've just got to be better and put body on body and make sure that we're challenging everything at the rim, not giving up back-cuts and slips for open threes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think whenever we watch this film, it's going to look way worse than it really is, but that's the only way you're going to learn from it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think I've done well in that area. I'm always going to pass the ball to my teammates. I have so much belief and faith in them that they are going to take and make shots, and if they can't, then they are going to make the next play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's how we have been playing all year long. That's not going to change now that we are in the Finals. Maybe I have to be a little bit more aggressive. I've got to put pressure on the rim. Me with no free throws, that was all on myself, nobody else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"So we'll definitely correct that the next game, but only I can do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"Jamal is a talented player. He can score in a number of ways. I think one of the things that makes him difficult to guard is when he gets off the ball, and then you have to deal with the cuts and he's circling back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"And they know they are looking for him. So when he's off the ball, you already know the ball is going to end up in his hands at some point. He's a dynamic scorer. He poses threats in different ways and he's relentless."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,GABE VINCENT,"It will be a tall task, and we'll continue to work at it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"For me, yeah, you've got to attack and attack everybody, not just one individual. I have to do a better job of creating the help, one, two guys, and getting to my shooter, otherwise finishing at the rim, making shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,JIMMY BUTLER,"But we missed a lot tonight and we'll be better in Game 2. At the end of the day, that's what it is, and we'll take this and we'll learn from it, and we'll be back in two days."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BRUCE BROWN JR,I don't think there's any secret. It's tough. But our game plan was trying not to foul. We know they're going to pump fake a lot. Jimmy is great at it. Gabe has been doing it. Bam has been doing it. So just trying to get our hands in the air and jump for everything.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, our second unit, we usually switch one through five because we've got Jeff at the 5. It just makes it a lot easier for us and the second unit. We can be more physical, more aggressive, and try to get stops and get out in transition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, it was great. Everybody was on a string. Everybody knew what we were supposed to be doing. Huge shout-out to Mike Porter Jr.. I've seen a few things of him not being a great defender, but he was great for us tonight, challenging at the rim, getting blocks and rebounding. So, kudos to him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, we were ready, but I was dead in the first. I'm going to be honest, I was cramping. But you've got to get used to the altitude every time we leave and come back, so I think we did a pretty good job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Definitely. And also, I made open shots. I made the shot that I usually shoot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Definitely. Definitely comfortable with the shots we took. You know, I felt like we had a lot of open shots tonight. Ball just didn't go in. That's part of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,But I feel like our shooters will bounce back.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like early in the game, miscommunications caused a lot of our guys to not talk enough. Miscommunications, and a lot of guys were open in the first half."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like going into the second half, we definitely got better with the cadence and talked through it more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"I don't, honestly. I don't think that was part of the game anyway. I mean, we didn't -- I didn't even think about the altitude until you just said it. But the biggest thing is we just missed open shots. We took care of the ball. We got it where it was supposed to go. We just missed shots today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,We made history.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"No. I mean, when we got in the locker room and seen the stat sheet, I feel like that we were all shocked that we only had two free throws."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, Jamal, he's a three-level scorer He can shoot the three, he can pull up and get to the rim. Just got to make it difficult as much as possible. He's a crafty player, has a good handle. He's in good condition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"So I mean, we've got to just key in on him and just make it as tough as possible for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"And yeah, I'll probably be guarding him a lot this series as well, and we have a lot of different guys who can guard him. So it will be interesting to see how we do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But like I said, I feel like we'll bounce back Game 2."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I mean, this is the ultimate stage, the Finals. I've been prepared for it. I've been working at this my whole life. I'm built for this. You know, the ups and downs through the season I've been through and the ups and downs I've been through in my career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"So you know, I'm ready to go, and I'm built for this, like I said."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"If I do say something, will you take the fine? Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Like I said, I just feel like we can't even get into that. You know, we can't let them dictate the game. I just feel like we took a lot of jumpshots, and we missed a lot of them instead of getting to the basket."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Like I said, we're going to watch film and get back to the drawing board."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"I feel really fortunate because I've had a front-row seat to when he was undrafted and we signed him. To see kind of the highs and lows that he's gone through, in Charlotte getting a few opportunities with his brother, to being let go by the Hornets and then to where he's at now, being a huge piece in what we're doing here. To be in the Finals is really a testament to how hard he's worked. He's one of the ultimate competitors."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"Yeah, not too much. It's just really fun because it's all the media that you see here today, all the fans, millions of people watching at home, it all comes down to 10 people on the court, and that's what we live for. That's what we live for, the battle. At the end of the day, you've still got to line it up. We believe in the competitors that we have in our locker room, so we aren't afraid of anyone. We aren't afraid of the moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"It's definitely been a fun locker room to be a part of. For me having played with different organizations and played for 10 years, this is such a fun opportunity for me to play in the Finals but also just to be a part of this locker room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"Yeah, obviously they're both super talented individually but also them working together. That's a lot of their fourth-quarter offense. It's a lot of what they go through. Obviously Murray can put up big numbers and Jokic can do a little bit of everything. Obviously he gets the rest of the guys involved. He can pass it. He's been shooting it incredibly well in the Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,So they can do a little bit of everything. There's no perfect way to guard it. There's no perfect matchup. But you just try to make it tough on them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"I've been in the league for 10 years, and I've guarded him a lot. Not saying I've stopped him a lot, but I've guarded him a lot. I think that's the biggest thing is just having a little bit of experience. I think what he does best is pass, gets all of his teammates involved. Of course they make some easy buckets off of him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"But you say that, and he's had some crazy scoring games, as well. It's not like you can only defend him against the pass."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"He's a handful. I'm sure it's going to be all hands on deck. Bam is a good defender, and I'm sure I'll get my try. I'm sure we'll try some smaller guys on him, try some bigger guys on him. It'll be kind of all hands on deck just to try to slow him down."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"We're really close. Actually I'm getting married in August, and Bobby is going to be one of my groomsmen. We're that close."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"He was one of the first people that reached out to me when I got drafted in Charlotte my rookie year. I didn't know a single person in Charlotte, 20 years old, moving away from home, and him and his wife, Tess, cooked me home-cooked meals once a week when I was in Charlotte. We played tennis together, ping-pong, board games. We'd do all kinds of stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CODY ZELLER,"He's become really good for me, as well, just because he's been -- he's won a championship, he's a Hall of Famer, but he also kind of puts things into perspective of there's more to life than just basketball, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"This season has been interesting. We've had highs. We've had lows. Obviously we've made a push from the 8 seed to the Finals. We've showed a lot of resilience, a lot of persistence, a lot of belief in one another, and we're just excited for the opportunity that's ahead."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, obviously we take the experience from this past series into the next, but this is a totally different series now. We start from blank, we start from scratch. It's 0-0, and we just try to approach each game with the right mindset and just try to take care of business."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Doing well, thank you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"I'd say the support of my family and friends has helped me over time, but I think you grow confidence in anything you're doing with the amount of work you put in, whether it's cooking or golf or basketball. I think we all put a lot of hours and time in and extra reps and shots, et cetera, that when the time comes, you have faith and have confidence because of the work you have instilled."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"This group especially has put in a lot of work on the court, off the court, battling together. We're definitely a confident group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, I'd say one of the most important things I've learned at Santa Barbara was the value of relationships. And I just had to alter my leadership style maybe at that time as a young kid to what it is now. And just continue to grow and evolve and find ways to be a better leader, to better inspire, to just help move the needle with whatever group I'm with as best as I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with. So I'm fortunate enough to be able to be the one right now that's in the limelight, to be able to represent our area the best I can, and I look forward to being able to represent Miami, as well, and trying to get this title."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,A 10 out of 10. I love Jimmy's music taste. We go back and forth with music. I could listen to music with Jimmy for hours.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MAX STRUS,"I'm not worried about it at all. We're ready to play. It don't matter where it's at, where we're playing. We're ready for everything. It's not going to be a problem at all."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MAX STRUS,"Mike is talented, man. We've got the same agent, so I've known him for a while. He can shoot the ball really well and get it off very quick, so he's definitely going to be a problem that we've got to make sure we keep an eye on and not let him get too hot, because we know if he makes a couple, he can get it going. So definitely keep an eye on him, as well as the other guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MAX STRUS,"Oh, that's probably something every day that I could say. Me and Jimmy got a unique relationship. It's like Kyle just said, like 2011, I was still in high school, and watching him play on the Bulls, and me being from Chicago just growing up watching him, it's kind of crazy that I'm on his team trying to help him win a championship here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MAX STRUS,"I'm just here to help him whatever he needs and whatever he asks me to do or for the team to do, I'm willing to do it because he's one of the most highest basketball IQs I've ever been a part of and been around."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MAX STRUS,"Yeah, Jimmy just wants to win at any cost. He's not worried about any of the extracurricular stuff. He just wants to play basketball at the highest level and play the right way, and that's how we're all built. He just goes about it with that confidence, and he doesn't need to talk. He lets his playing do the talking, and we're all just here following in his footsteps, and he just gives our team the utmost confidence in each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MAX STRUS,"I think he gives the belief in you by putting you out there. We all come from two-ways or undrafted guys. So, the ability to get the opportunity to play shows that he believes in you the most, in the fullest. It trickles down from our star players guys like Bam, Jimmy, Kyle. They believe in everybody in our lineup, that we can go out there and help win games and win at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MAX STRUS,"To have the trust from them and the coaching staff, it just trickles down and has us be the most belief in ourselves, and it's a special thing. It's a really special thing to be a part of, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We're not getting into any of that stuff. Our guys are in great shape. They're ready to compete. If Denver wants to tip this thing off at the top of Everest, we'll do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This thing is going to be decided between the four lines. They've also got to come back to Miami. If you want to make it about that, we'll turn off the air conditioning and they've got to play in 90-degree humidity, sap the s--- out of their legs. This thing is going to be decided between those four lines, and we'll decide it then."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think it's been defined enough. I think you can just look at all the, whatever, thousand other articles about it. I don't think anybody wants to hear about it. It's something we believe in. It's for us. It's not for everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I also think you do have to credit and acknowledge Denver's culture. They have a very strong culture. I don't think it's a coincidence that the two teams have been able to have sustained success, and they've done a great job of building their culture."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Mike and his staff have just done a tremendous job of building a system that fits perfectly around their two top players, and they do all the right things. You're not going to have any kind of weaknesses or glitches or cracks in a culture or professionalism or anything like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,We feel the same way about our group. I just think it's set up for great competition.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, I probably think more than anything, it's just the more experience you have, just the more gratitude you have for any of these kind of opportunities. This league is so fragile. It is so tough to go through the gauntlet. Not only just a regular season, 82 games, five and a half months, but then to go through the gauntlet of three seven-game series just to get to this point. You're just really grateful for these kind of opportunities."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"This is a special group. This group has been able to overcome a lot of different things, handle a lot of adversity, setbacks, things that have not gone the way we wanted it to go. Instead of having that collapse our spirit, it allowed us to develop some fortitude and grit collectively and give us something to rally around, which was each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Those are special qualities. I mentioned the other night, it's a reflection of life to be able to develop those kind of things that can get you through the tough times, and then when you overcome it, just makes things a lot more gratifying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"He's very unique. He doesn't really have any noticeable weaknesses in terms of his size, his skill set. He's one of one in the myriad of ways that he can impact the game and impact winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have great respect for the Denver Nuggets' organization, how they operate and the system that they run. That's the way it should be. You shouldn't be playing any ducks at this point when you get to the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know why maybe the mainstream media have kind of slept on Denver, but when we saw them in the bubble, we thought, all right, this team is going to be doing basically what they're doing this year, then up until now. We thought this would be a run for a long time. If Murray didn't get hurt, they probably would have had a couple of Finals berths. That's how great of a duo they are and a system Mike and his staff have built that really fits."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I think, we all think they're legit, and in some ways, it's a mirror image series, not in terms of style, but teams that probably have been overlooked, underestimated, built a chip on their shoulder over that. It's lined up to be a great competition."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'm not a math guy, so I'm not good with percentages. He will not play tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We don't want to get ahead of ourselves right now. He's still just starting this process. We do have a few days here just to continuous work. I can't even make any kind of proclamation until he takes these next important steps, and that's with contact and doing things more on the court live."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We'll just see. We're all encouraged by his progress that he's made, but we want to continue to be responsible and make the best decisions. He's not there yet."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's still going to be all hands on deck. However this thing starts tomorrow, it probably will be similar to the last series, and it's going to look different by the end of the series. You have to be open to all the different possibilities. Both K-Love and Cody are major pieces to what we do. When you're dealing with a guy like Jokic, you're probably going to need several bigs, and thankfully we do have that kind of roster depth at that position. They all bring something a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Nobody is going to be a, quote-unquote, stopper in this series. This is about competing every single possession, finding different kind of advantages in the margins that only competitors can find. But thankfully we do have both of those guys, and we were able to pick them up late."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Well, they're both dynamic. They both can do it on their own, but they also both really complement each other. That's hard to find in this league, when your two best players just absolutely complement each other. They both have scored 50 in a playoff game, and they both can be facilitators."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,I don't think either one of them care how many points they score. It's just about getting the most efficient shot for the offense.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I didn't really think about it like that because back then, I was still thinking, hey, I'm going to play in the league. I definitely wasn't thinking, I want to be Jack Ramsay. I was scared of him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"The story has been told many times, but I probably had a little bit more awareness, I'm going nowhere as a player, and when Rick Adelman was the coach -- Jack Ramsay was the first image I had of a head coach. He was the coach of our team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"As I got older in high school and college, it was Rick. I just loved the way he operated. He's been a big mentor to me, so the Adelman kids, including David, and I've known David since he was probably 3, we were all running around the facility."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But that's probably when I followed them the most, was when they made those two Finals runs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"No, that wasn't really a thought. It was more just celebrating that team and really trying to support all the families. The organizations were much smaller then, so it really felt like a family deal. You grew up with the organization, just trying to support them and figure out how they could knock off those Bulls teams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, it's those moments when nobody else understands. Nobody else is in the locker room. Nobody else -- we say that all the time, our guys are the men in the arena. It's tough to explain it to people on the outside."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But when you have these privileges to be able to go through adversity or setbacks and learn from that, I think those are lessons that we all could benefit from. You develop a grit and a collective perseverance and fortitude. If you approach it the right way, which this group does, you can really grow. They can be incredible life experiences, to be able to come together like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But Denver has a very similar personality. We didn't necessarily hang out with them in the bubble, but competitors recognize competitors and we would acknowledge them. We didn't have to face them in the Playoffs, but we always just seemed to bump into them. The staffs would bump into each other out on the lake. For whatever reason we were all fishing out there, and those were the two organizations that were doing it. I have no idea why."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But they're good people, great competitors. We have respect for them. They have an edge. Mike has an edge. That edge is going to be there for both sides. It's going to be decided between those four lines. This is what you want. You want the greatest challenges in this league. You're not expecting anything to be easy, particularly when you get to this level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We just want to get this started. We have great, great competitors that want to put themselves out there for everybody to see and judge and have no fear about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Man, it's been gratifying. I can't thank the Lord enough, to be honest with you. It's been a great ride. Like you said, it's been a long run, 13 years, 13 teams. To get to this time and this level, it feels really, really good. I'm excited about it, but we've got four more to go. I'm a kid that has always been somebody -- I don't really kind of realize I'm in it until it's over with, so now that we're in it, we've just got to get four more, and I think I'll kind of soak it all in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Yeah, me, DJ and Jeff, I guess we're the old heads, so for us, you could see DJ in the back kind of soaking it all in. Me and Jeff hugged each other -- I think I hugged him tighter than I hug my wife."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"It was just a situation where we were like -- I think the young guys don't really understand the grind that you go through. So it felt good. It felt really, really good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Like I said, still four more to go, but then it settles in and you're like, hold on, this is just the Conference Finals now we've got to get to the Finals-Finals and go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Oh, you know what, we talked about it in training camp. This organization has been really, really good. I know I haven't been here for a long time, but it's been very organized. It's a team that knows what it wants, the plan, how we want to play, from the top to the coaches, everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"It's been great. It's been fun. I can't even lie to you. You usually don't say that when you're not playing and you're in like a leadership role. But it's been fun. When we won the Western Conference Finals, we all had a moment in the back of the plane. That kind of like sums everything up how much this year has been."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Families have enjoyed it, so it's been good. It's been really, really good. The Nuggets, man, we're going to be here to stay for a long, long time, especially when you've got 15 Nikola Jokic and 27 Jamal Murray. It goes a long way when you've got those two guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Honestly, I think you've got to take constructive criticism. I think when people tell you you can't do something, don't take it personal. Realize what you have to do to get better, find your fit, whatever that is. And then on top of that, just keep going, keep pushing, keep pressing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Like I said, I can't thank the Lord enough about this journey, how it's been. It's been fun. But that's the biggest thing I try to tell people Don't take anything personal. Whatever people tell you, take it as constructive criticism, try to get better at it and just keep pushing and pressing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"You know what, I'm still moving pretty fast, so we'll see. We'll see. Right now I'm just enjoying this, and as long as I'm here, as long as they want me to be back here or anywhere else, I'm going to be here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Somebody told me, a vet told me, he was like, you don't want to have any regrets, so when you're done, you don't want to be like, man, I can still play. Until they cut off the lights and say don't come back, I'm going to be out here playing. You're still going to see No. 14 running fast."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Yeah, altitude is a real thing. It usually gives you about a week and a half, two weeks for you to kind of get adjusted to it. Then after that, you find your flow, you find your feeling. You really feel it when you go to opposing gyms. So when you go and play other teams, you realize you can run longer and faster and harder. It really is an advantage. But it takes you about a week and a half, two weeks. For me it did. I don't know about everybody else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"MJ. I was truly thankful about my journey going all the way around. I think I've been on 45 different teams. One of them was in Charlotte. Having Mike as an owner, meeting him -- it's funny because that's what I grew up on, NBA on NBC. So you see MJ and it was just a surreal moment to sign with him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"That's what I think about. When I think about the Finals, that was my era, the '90s. I was a kid. Mike dominated the '90s. There were a lot of great players. That just speaks to how great he was."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ISH SMITH,"Yes, sir, and he made a lot of moments."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I mean, we've played here before, so it's not some folklore that no one has seen before. A lot of us have played here a handful of times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,It's nothing new. We don't expect it to have any sort of impact.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, they're playing really well. They have a handful of guys that can beat you on any given night. Obviously starts with those main two, Jokic and Murray."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Really talented offensively, and they're going to make you work for everything defensively. They pose a great challenge for us. We're excited about it. Definitely they play differently a little bit than some of the other teams that we've played, just so much of their offense being focused around those two, but both those guys are such willing passers, as well. It'll be a good challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, there's lots of moments, kind of when there's a pause in the action, I guess, if you will, to kind of step back and be appreciative of the journey. When you're in it throughout the day to day, you're just focused on what's next. Obviously your perspective shifts and changes as you advance in your career and you want more for yourself, because we're all competitive people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"But there's always moments to be able to sit back and reflect. A lot of it comes from sharing memories and experiences with people that have kind of been around for the entirety of the journey, family, friends, people in my corner, that are able to kind of offer me that perspective. I value those moments and conversations very much so with those people in particular."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, Mexico City was an amazing experience. I just remember the excitement, the energy in that arena. From when we got out there, shootaround and warmups, an hour plus before the game, it was basically packed. Just the entire country it felt like, just excited to have us there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It was definitely a memorable game, to be able to win that one. A lot has changed, a lot has transpired since then for this group in particular. We've had a lot of ups and downs. But that was definitely a cool moment to look back on in the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think the fact that he garners so much attention because he can score, but you have to be smart with how you approach it because he's such a willing passer and they're so good at playing off his overreaction. Finding that balance between making it difficult on him and throwing different looks and multiple defenders and what have you, while also making it so he doesn't constantly get everybody involved and easy looks and get them going as an offensive unit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think we have a connection and a competitive spirit, especially lately, just throughout the midst of this run. I think it's kind of all coming together at the right time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Those two things alone can really, really carry you. You're going to have stretches where the ball is not going in or maybe not playing the way that you want to as a group, but if you kind of have that collective trust and competitive spirit and grit to fall back on, I think that always gives you a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Kyle brings a ton of experience, obviously, from a years-in-the-league standpoint and also playoff experience and somebody who's held that trophy at the end. It's a huge luxury to have somebody like that in the locker room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Obviously I share the court with him a lot, kind of in that second group. He just can come in and just change the whole rhythm and flow of a game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"His impact is so much more than what you see in a box score or what shows up in terms of maybe the game film. He's a trusted leader, somebody that we all kind of count on. I think he does a really good job of navigating that line between discipline and holding people accountable while also maintaining a certain sense of humor and levity to it, as well. He's been huge for us, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,Fist pumping.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, it's been nice. I've had a lot of friends text me about the watch parties, gathering around. The support has been crazy back home. That means a lot, especially from a small town like Kitchener."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Excited for that town. Be back there in the summer, see my friends and family. But, yeah, no one from Kitchener has made the this far, so it's nice to be a pioneer in that sense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,Always had the fire to be on the floor. I didn't need to be in broadcasting to find that fire.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,It was cool to see all the attention that the Raptors got at that time. It was just cool to be a fan of the game at that time of the year. It's even better to be playing.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,It's cool to see. Saw it at the pop-up shop at the gas station the other day. Thought that was cool. Haven't seen that before out here.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"All the little things. Seeing my jersey more often. Anybody's, honestly. To see the city rally behind the team, even the other teams, other players on other teams. I think Kyle wore my jersey while he was practicing. I think that was cool. Saw him at dinner the other day, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,Everybody in the city is behind us. That means a lot.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,I always loved basketball. Couldn't afford the equipment for hockey at the time. Basketball was the easiest thing to give me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I just fell in love with it. The only thing I wanted to do. Night and day, it made me happy, and still does to this day smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Strengthen my knee, as well smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"But, yeah, it was nice to not have -- obviously the outside noise can be pressure, regardless if you're healthy or not at the time. To have the team say to you, It's up to you, if you want to come back, if you're ready. If not, it's okay. We'll wait."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"That meant a lot, knowing that I was in no rush and that I could just focus on my health at the time. I was still working to get back. Just that mental factor of having something to strive for at the time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"But wasn't there. Now you look back, my dad at the time, he didn't want me to play either, just knowing what I can do, how I should look, especially to him. He's been watching me my whole life. At the time I didn't look like that, even if I was making shots or whatever. I knew I wasn't 100."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,To hear from him meant a lot more. It was a team effort in that decision.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, watched all the games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, it's best of seven, first to four. We didn't know who we were going to play. We prepared for both. Once we finally knew, it kind of brought us all to ease to be able to prepare mentally just for the matchups, game plan, all that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was a little relieving to see, a couple days ago, the result. Yeah, we're excited."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Show your hands. Be in stance. It's going to take a team effort, crowd. Verticality, jumping straight up when he attacks the rim. He's going to throw his body at you. He's going to fall to the floor. You just got to stay solid and be as legal as possible. That's a couple things to touch on."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just keep that same mentality. I know there's a lot of media in here and stuff, but we have four wins to go. Keep that same mind state, stay focused. Can't get relaxed or complacent. I think that's the biggest thing. Or satisfied. We haven't won a championship. Until then, stay in the right mindset and everything will come."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"I don't know. I remember watching LeBron against the Spurs, when the Spurs swept in the Finals. I remember Miami versus the Spurs smiling. I don't know. I don't remember specifics."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just remember the stage, the crowd being really into it, all the eyes, everybody talking about it within the city, outside. It's just a great environment to be in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,Excited for the opportunity. We want to make the most of it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,Every time smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Funny thing is it wasn't just for the championship. I used to, like, write down the playoff seeding, put myself on one of the teams, then play. If we played Detroit Pistons, I would go against Billups and Rasheed Wallace, and just talk like Marv Albert, all of them. I was in deep. I was making shot after shot, trust me laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Oh, I can be honest about it. I can be honest about it laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, as players. I'm talking about a basketball camp."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"But me and Ben were there. I was coaching him up. He was really athletic, as he is now, jumping over everybody. Couldn't shoot as well as he could now. Developed his game a little bit. Matured so much. So proud of him as a fellow Canadian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"We played one on one. I think I hit a couple stepbacks, little fadeaways."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,I am. We're talking four years ago.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,This guy over here. Next question laughter.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I was trying to get your confidence up. I remember that. I got you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think I was giving you confidence. Yeah, for sure. You asked me to be honest, I'm being honest smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,I think these are the two last teams remaining. Have the most chemistry within each other. Lowry has been a champion. Jimmy has been in the Playoffs a ton. I remember we played Jimmy in Minnesota for the eight seed. I forget what year. I think it was 2018.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,I'm trying to go through the team.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"Drafted or not, they can all play. They play really well. The handoffs that they do. They put us in a lot of actions. The ball is hopping. They're unselfish looking for the shot, looking for the best shot. They use the whole shot clock. I think they're very well-rounded team and they trust each other. They've trusted each other a lot throughout the season. I think that's what sets them apart from all the other teams in the East that they faced."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think they're really together through the ups and downs. They're very resilient. Kind of like us in a sense where we're very resilient. Been together, continuity, chemistry, ball hops, unselfish. They're more of a gritty defensive team throughout the season, and we're more of an offensive powerhouse throughout the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JAMAL MURRAY,I think it's going to be a fun series.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"Man, he's been huge in motivating us and just getting us right mentally. You can definitely tell he works on himself in the mental aspect. He studies that and he betters himself and he takes pride in that, and to be able to relay those messages in the way they're relayed to us has been super important to us, and how prepared we are not only physically but mentally."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"Yes, they're a unique team. They've got a lot of different ways of scoring, putting the ball in the hoop, and they share the ball. You can tell they really love playing together, and I think that's what's so important and that's gotten them to this point, and I think that's what makes them special is they share the ball and they score and put the ball in the hole in multiple ways."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"We definitely have to figure out different type of plans. I'm sure we'll adjust a lot on the fly to figure out how to keep that ball away from the rim, but they've got one of the best players in the league, and we'll just have to figure it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, I think the G League has improved tremendously. I think they do a great job even promoting the guys that are playing there. Luckily enough when I was playing there, especially in Greensboro, I was on NBA assignment. So, I had the luxury of being able to play heavy minutes and get plays and get shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,But it really got me better just playing and learning how to play and being in a different environments and positions. And just the talent that's in the G League is so overlooked. There's so many people that can play at an NBA level at any given night and play very well and contribute to a winning team.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"I just think the talent aspect and the preparation that it takes to play well, even in the G League, definitely helps you get to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"For sure. I talk about that all the time. We've got the leader, the head of the snake of our team, got drafted 30th. He wasn't a lottery pick or anything like that. His path to get to where he is is very similar to a lot of ours. He was very overlooked coming up, even through high school and college and those type of things. He didn't have all the five stars and all the Kentuckys and Carolinas going after him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"Looking at a guy like that, he definitely gives you hope, and also just puts it in perspective that it's about the long game it's not about having everything at once. It might take some people two, three years, might take some people nine years. But just sticking with it and continuing to perfect your craft can put you in a great position."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"Yeah, it's definitely been a little different for sure, getting recognition or attention."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"But I feel like more often than not right now, this is a time that I kind of stay away from social media, especially when you're this close to -- you're four games away from being a champion, I think this is the most important time to stay locked in, stay focused. But this is what comes with it, whenever you're winning and you're moving on, this stuff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"So, it's great publicity and I'm very grateful and appreciative that even Bam, guys like that, are saying that I've made a name for myself because that's the whole reason I've been trying to prove myself since I've been in the league. But it's one thing to do it once for a series or whatever, and it's another thing to stay consistent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"I got a ton of messages from my people, man. Some messages I can't really say on here, but it's all been positive and supportive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,He's definitely going to come. He's going to come here and he's going to make sure he's in town and make sure he comes to see me play.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"But all my people hit me up, just congratulating me, but that's how I know my people understand and they want me to get four more just because -- just as hyped as they are right now, they're trying to keep me focused saying, we've got four more. Stay focused for four more. So got one more round to try to get to where we're trying to get, but my people couldn't be happier right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,He called me before I got undressed.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"I don't know if he's -- he's definitely going to be at some games for sure. I already talked to him about that. I don't know which ones yet, but yeah, he called me before I got undressed after Game 7. Just hyped, just screaming, just jumping up and down. That's like my brother."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"He was just as hyped as my family was. He's one of the first people that called me. Yeah, man, that's my dog. He's super proud, super appreciative, and couldn't be happier."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"I think just getting our foot in the door. I think that was the biggest thing for us. We just knew we had a gear, and once we got into the Playoffs, it was kind of a relief. Now we could just focus on playing. We just knew we liked our chances pretty much with anybody, knowing that it was the first team to four."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"It's different when it's like the NCAA Tournament and the play-in. We had two chances, but other teams had one chance. After losing that first one, we knew it was the only chance we had to get into the Playoffs. Once we finally got in, we could take a deep breath, get back to focusing on just playing, and knowing that a team had to beat us four times, and it was going to be tough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"I think most importantly, what I learned from them is after the losses, because I'm so used to getting down on myself. It's kind of like a college mentality where I've kind of had to learn from that where you get so mad and get so down on yourself, beat yourself up about losses, and I kind of look at the way those guys operate after losses, and not that they don't care, but they understand it's a series. It's multiple games, it's not just one game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CALEB MARTIN,"They also understand how quick the turnaround is for the next one, to be able to come in with the right mindset that you kind of let things, leave them in the rear view. So, I've been trying to learn that and I think I've matured in that aspect just from being around those guys. So, I think that's really important for me and the growth of my game so far."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is part of it. You have an option to look at it as a distraction or look at it as part of the process. This is the NBA Finals. Doesn't get any bigger than this. So we got our work in upstairs in the friendly confines of our practice court and behind closed doors. Then we come downstairs and do our part, make ourselves available."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I'm just following the lead of Nick O'Hayre and the NBA, doing what they tell me to do, answering the same questions for a third day in a row. But I love it and I got a smile on my face smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,That's an interesting question. And my father did try to talk me out of it. I don't know if Rick Adelman or Flip Saunders did for their respective kids.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I had Wes Unseld on my staff prior, another guy that grew up in this business. I think for David Adelman, whose father, Rick, is a Hall of Famer, for Ryan Saunders, whose dad, Flip, God rest his soul, was tremendous to me in my career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"For me, it's just having basketball people. They're junkies. David Adelman eats, drinks, sleeps basketball, as does Ryan, everybody on my staff."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"There's something to be said growing up the son of a coach, being around the game at every level. My father was a high school coach in New York City, a college coach, an NBA coach, a head coach in the NBA. For Ryan Saunders and the journey that Flip was on throughout the CBA and the NBA, and for Rick Adelman and his many stops. You're hiring somebody that knows the game and knows what comes with the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I feel really fortunate to have the staff that I have, not because they're coaches' sons, but they're great guys who help me out a ton."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I mean, I think they use zone more possessions than anybody. I thought their zone and their pressure back to zone was key in that last series against Boston. I thought it gave Boston trouble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"As you've mentioned, we've seen zone all year long. I think we have one of the better zone efficiencies on the offensive end. Right now in the Playoffs, I think our offensive rating is maybe the best for a team that's ever been in the Finals. We're prepared for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"If we do see the zone, a lot of teams when they see the zone will panic instead of just playing the game, getting the ball into the middle of the zone, using dribble penetration to collapse the zone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"The other thing we talk about, if we call a play, they're in zone, just run the play. This is not college. Bam Adebayo cannot stand in the paint. He's got to cleanse himself at some point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I'll say to that is the best zone offense is your defense. If you get stops and rebounds, that makes it really hard for a team to fall back into a 2-3 zone and try to take you out of your rhythm."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, the last part first."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"That was a discussion we had the day after he suffered the ACL. That was, like, important for him to hear, in my opinion, because in that moment it's devastation. Negativity fills your mind about what's going to happen, how do I come back from this. That rehab process can be a torturous one, one that takes a lot of mental toughness."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"Jamal is really fortunate because he has a wonderful mother, father and brother, close-knit family. He had an organization, from myself, the front office, ownership, teammates and medical staff, that supported him from day one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"Going into the Playoffs last year, you use the word ""flicker,"" there was a flicker of hope last game of the regular season against the Lakers. Maybe Jamal can play, be back for the Playoffs. It wasn't there. He wasn't ready. We weren't going to push him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then throughout the summer, as he worked out in different places, whether it was at home, here, in Phoenix, he took a trip over to Australia, and I saw a video of him playing over there. That's when I knew that he was ready to come back and start the journey to recovery, and more importantly the journey to being the best version of himself as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"Couldn't be more proud of Jamal. Nikola Jokic was deserving of the MVP last round. Fully deserved it. Averaged a triple-double. If you saw what Jamal did in the Western Conference Finals, in a sweep, 32 points, maybe 50, 40, 90 in terms of his percentages, six rebounds, six assists, it was just incredible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I've been here for eight years now. I think, if anything, the fans here, not just in Denver, but Nugget fans everywhere, even back home in Serbia, I think they appreciate and respect him for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's not trying to be something he's not. He's not trying to create a narrative other than I'm Nikola Jokic, I play for the Denver Nuggets, I'm going to do everything I can to help our team win. I'm going to do it with class, professionalism. I'm never going to make it about me. That's a rarity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I often make the comparison, I never coached Tim Duncan, but just from coaching against him and hearing stories about those that have been around him, Tim Duncan was a selfless superstar."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I look at Nikola Jokic in the same vein. I think he's a truly selfless superstar, where it's not about him. He's not looking for people to ""Look at me, tell me how great I am."" He's almost embarrassed by the attention. He wants to be one of the guys in the locker room, have fun, work hard and win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's the thing that motivates every one of us. We have yet to win a championship. That's why we're excited to be here, but know we have a ton of work. It's going to be the hardest challenge that any of us have faced in our NBA careers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"It hasn't come up in any of my thoughts, discussions, narratives. That's a question probably more suited for the Miami Heat. For us, all we're worried about is winning Game 1 tomorrow night. That's our sole focus. None of the storylines that accompany this series are going to distract us from that focus."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, there was a game in his rookie season. Just to backtrack a little bit, to Nikola's credit, once we got back from Las Vegas that first Summer League where he was a solid player, he realized at that point in time that I got to get in better shape and I have to lose weight. He did that, like, right away. I think that was a sign for me that this kid is serious about this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"But there was a game in his rookie season at San Antonio. He put up a crazy stat line, I don't know, 25 or 26 points, 12 or 13 rebounds, six or seven assists against a guy like Tim Duncan. That was, for me, kind of when that light bulb went off saying, Wow, what he just did, who he did it against, on the road against this team coached by that guy, this kid has a chance to be a special player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,I think the second-most-important moment in Nikola's and our history was second year when we tried to play Nikola and Jusuf Nurkic together to start that year. Did not go as well as we had hoped. I was bringing Nikola off the bench. We lost the game at Dallas. I remember having the conversation about what am I doing? This kid was All-Rookie as a center.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"I started him that next game, probably around December 12th, year two, and that's when our team took off. He became the focal point of everything we did. We realized that we had a player that we could build an offense and a team and an organization around."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then you draft a guy like Jamal, the pieces that we've added and you get to where we are today. It was that San Antonio game that really stood out to me about the potential that he had."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,They weren't really battles. I won every game we played against them laughter.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"No, that Georgetown-Villanova rivalry goes back a long way and the respect that the two universities have for each other is awesome. The pros that they've both made. But just being able to have a guy who has been in the league now 16 years, a guy I played against in college, just kind of him going through his heart stuff, just to be able to see him have this opportunity on this stage and to be able to still be playing basketball at this high level is a pretty cool story for him. You just appreciate a guy like him for all the things he's been through and is still doing it at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it was just something that it was a heated moment. It hurt a teammate of ours, and we wanted to have his back. At that time, we're always going to have our teammate's back in that moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"But I don't think there's anything festering. We're at a different level. We understand that it's about winning four games right now. Anything that has happened in the past is things that we can't control right now. We've got to worry about winning basketball games, and that's all that really matters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"Belief and trust in your coach, honestly, and belief in each other. Being able to switch from zone to man to whatever you want to, trap, double-team, doing different things. You've got to be able to have a sharp mind and be in the moment and say whatever Coach needs, I can do, will do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"It's just fun to be able to switch things up, change rhythms, because sometimes you've just got to do something different, which in Toronto we did that, and in Miami we're doing that now. We're switching up and doing different coverages, different things. And the versatility that we have on this team is pretty remarkable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"I think it will help a lot, but we've also got a head coach who's been doing it a long time, also, who has been here more than me. But I think just for me in this moment with these guys, I'll be able to help just kind of keep our focus, stay here. We've also got Udonis Haslem, who has been here, who has three rings, also."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"But I think we're just prepared mentally to stay stable no matter what happens. It's kind of been our season the whole year, just being here and staying in the moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"His personality is very different. He's one of a kind. But how he treats his teammates, he treats his friends, it's like no other. I think that's what helps us as a group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"He may say some things or he may do some things that you might be like, oh, whoa. But it's coming from the best part of his heart."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"Because we're around him every single day, unfortunately, but fortunately. But being around him, you just get to learn the guy and learn his true love for the game and his true love for winning and for you as an individual."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"Man, you're aging me so bad. Max was still in high school."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"He used to embarrass me and Aaron Brooks in practice. Too fast, couldn't keep up with him. I ain't going to lie, I used to dislike having to go live practice against him. But if you go back and look at his journey and the things he's been through, to finally get to this point of getting to the Finals, I can't wait to just see him and say hello. Every time I see him, he'd still call me ""vet."""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"He was just a good kid. Coming out of Wake Forest, wasn't the best shooter but could get anywhere on the floor at any time, any moment. He was always a special kid and a special guy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,Sometimes you just have these stories that people should look into because his story is a very unorthodox story. I'm sure he's happy to be in this moment.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we just don't care about what others think. I think we do what we do no matter what. I think we work hard no matter the time, the place, the situation. I think we prepare ourselves, and we're well-prepared to go into any situation no matter where it is, what time, anything. We're prepared to do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KYLE LOWRY,"The culture is just about believing, and we believe in what we do every single day, every night, the work we put in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"2014, I believe as a team to Rio had a great experience, obviously playing with Andy Anderson Varejao who showed us a number of amazing things out there in Brazil."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Everything, man. We were there I think for five days. We saw Christ the Redeemer, we went to different beaches, different places to eat, as well as seeing all the basketball fans over there and how the game has grown."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"I think it all depends on who Denver puts out there and the matchups that are out there. As you saw in the Celtics series, they decided to go small. We started to match that, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"We'll go over our game plan today, we'll see a lot of things that are going to stick out on film, a lot of things that we'll be able to do, who we'll be able to match up with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Denver is an extremely tough team. They're here for a reason. They're well-coached offensively and defensively. They're very sound, they stick true to their principles. They push the ball, they shoot the ball extremely well. Defensively they're there for one another."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"It's going to be a really hard-fought series. But Denver is a great place to play as well, so we're excited."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"I mean, it made perfect sense to me honestly. I obviously was eager, wanted to play, kept myself ready. At the same time those matchups, how they took Williams out of the starting lineup, decided to go small, that's how kind of it goes into matchups, that's how it works within the Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"I felt I made my impact in at least the first two games, maybe one quarter before I had gotten hurt there. Again, just continued to be there for my teammates, be a vocal leader, keep it light between UD, Kyle and myself, just teach these guys, help them kind of grasp where we're at, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"I think the beauty of it is you get to reset the deck, figure out what the matchups are going to look like in this series. Again, this is a great group to be a cheerleader for."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"It's an amazing thing. It's what you play for. As a player, being a competitor as well, what it's all about. But I do think being here with a different team and with the Miami Heat, just such a storied franchise with so much rich history, I think it's very sweet being here for a fifth time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"I mean, I don't think that's something we're really focusing on. I just think we just wanted to get here as early as possible after that Game 7 victory. More than anything, just rest our bodies, be ready to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,Last guy on the Heat I would let babysit my kids? I don't know. Everybody's pretty damn responsible. Probably Nikola Jovic just because he's so damn young. That's the only thing I can think of. He's still a child himself. That would be tough.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"I mean, hopefully we'll deliver a championship soon thereafter. That would be a nice way to send him off. I told him, it wasn't in the script for us to lose Game 7 in Boston because he wasn't going out like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"UD is so special for this organization. It shows you that vets really do matter, 20 seasons, for an organization, in a place where he grew up, is truly a special thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Yeah, I mean, he's going to go down as one of the greatest big men to ever play the game. He just continues to impress and just beyond the statistical output that he has, the impact he has on the game, how he does it, how he operates, what we've seen, in a lot of ways is unprecedented."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"He's not a guy you're going to stop. You just have to hope to stand him down, continue to make things really tough for him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"He's extremely smart, manipulates the game. I mean that in a basketball IQ sense. Can get anything done how he wants to do it, where he wants to go. That's going to be a full team effort to just slow down what he's capable of doing, but again, easier said than done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"It was fine. Nine days is a very long time, especially when you're every other day here. Okay, like maybe we find out who we play tonight, maybe we don't. Obviously, we found out two days ago or so."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"I think during this nine days, we were able to be smart about managing -- continuing to stay sharp, staying in good shape, but also get the ability to rest that a lot of what's needed as a team. Somehow find a balance and take advantage of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Because he cares a lot. He's a competitor at heart. We can see the fight and tenacity that he has. He wants to win just as much as we do, and I think when you have a guy like that at the helm it's very important, and it's contagious to the players, and I think we all kind of rub off on each other. He can see what we're fired up and he's ready to go. When you've got guys like Ish who just come in and try to bring the morale down laughter, it's great, but we have other guys that are very positive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Oh, man, I've played against Reggie for a lot of years when he was at OKC, when he was in Detroit, and I always hated Reggie just because he was such a--. I'm being honest as a competitor, because he's such a good player. He's able to get downhill, he's a great shooter. He also can find guys. Him being able to kind of cut your defense apart was very annoying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"With him being on our team and him playing in spurts, whether he plays or not, I think that his knowledge of the game and him being able to help guys, I think that has been beneficial to a lot of our guards, and our energy has just been great, and I think guys like Ish and Jeff have done the same thing, and we really pick each other up out there, so that's great for our team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"You know what? That's a great question. I think for me, it's something that I practice a lot. I just wanted to go and try to learn from people smarter than me and peers about the subject that I was already kind of diving into on my own."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Basketball and everyday life, life is kind of a roller coaster, it's up and down, the emotions are high, stress level. I just wanted to be able to be able to find a better way to manage that throughout the course of my life on and off the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Yeah, I mean, when you kind of see greatness like his every day, you kind of get used to it. It's kind of bad to say that, but we'll come in after games and like KCP had 20 points and Bruce off the bench, 17 points, nine rebounds, it's great, Nikola, another 30-point triple-double. It's kind of like, we've said that about 65 times, so it kind of gets repetitive after a while. You kind of start to just take it as normal when it really isn't normal for somebody to do that throughout the course of the season, throughout the Playoffs, shoot at such a high percentage and be okay when he's not shooting the basketball. He's such a selfless player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"Jamal, Mike, whoever, Aaron, KCP, he's going to feed those guys. Sometimes we have to force him to shoot the basketball, which is crazy to think about. When you have a guy like that who is the head of the snake of the team, it's kind of -- it's great to be a part of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"I knew he was good. Just every night like that, that's great to see. I'm just glad to be a part of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DeANDRE JORDAN,"I think that's the thing. We've got a group of guys who are varied. We've got some great veterans, we've got a guy in KCP who's won a championship, who's been there, Jeff, myself, Ish, who have been in a ton of playoff runs with different teams, and some young guys who kind of keep it light and fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,Thank you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't even know. Back in the days, I don't remember to be honest. Maybe I remember when Dallas won the championship, Miami. I remember San Antonio winning it. But then, to be honest, I don't even remember the opponents."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It was Miami-San Antonio, right, in Miami when Ray Allen hit that big shot? I remember that one. To be honest, I don't remember. I remember recently when I got in the league, but I don't remember when I was growing up because it was a really hard to follow, to be honest, first. Then I was not really -- I was following your league and your basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Of course. I think everybody did that. Even Cody Wise probably did that. Three, two, one, trying to make a shot. Everybody did that probably in the life smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it's not Bam against me or whatever, whoever. It's Denver against Miami. Just because I think we kind of have a similar play style, we are getting everybody involved. We like to play team basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,It's not going to be me against him or anybody against anybody. It's going to be a Miami against a Denver. I think that's why it's going to be interesting.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, I think I cannot say that, but someone who is older can, who remembers, just knowing them or watching them play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But yes, Radivoj Korac is from my hometown, but I don't know, can really be compared or whatever. I think that's somebody older who remembers them, who did something probably in the basketball in Yugoslavia or Serbia or whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,But that's a good question. Thank you.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Model my game probably, yes, yes. Probably he's one of the best power forward players that play the game. He did with such a ease, it's really, really -- I remember when he play against me, he was little bit older, but he still gave me the easiest 20 points ever in life probably. He always had a counter, but he was so patient. I think he's a great player to look up to, to model your game to him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,We going to see tomorrow smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But, yes, we were waiting. I think we took a good, professional approach to those eight days, nine days, 10 days, whatever it was. Just because it's actually long break, you know, I think we did a good job. We stay in the shape getting ready, staying sharp, but still get enough rest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But about the opponent we going to see tomorrow, is that true or I'm lying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He was playing in the same team that I played back in Serbia. One of his coaches was my Godfather who work there. He told me I think year before he's going to get drafted that he's actually really good player, really good person, that he's really working hard, can have a talent to be NBA player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"So, I know him before I actually met him little bit. I never watch him play, to be honest. Just little highlights, but never like a full game, whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But he needs to say that. Whats he's going to say? I don't want to meet him smiling. Yes, good guy, good person. I saw he's getting bigger, so we're going to see if he's going to get opportunity to play. But I believe he will. He has a lot to offer."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,I'm confused.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's hard to say because sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not. I'm cool with that. I think everybody else are good with that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think the way how he play, everybody can step up, everybody can be a best player in one game or whatever, week, whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. I don't know, can I say myself as the best. The ball is in my hands a lot, so I make a lot of decisions. But I don't know if can be the best player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Las Vegas tell us that we were underdog before. That doesn't... It's not correct, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think we are not the favorite. I think in the Finals there is no favorites. This is going to be the hardest game of our life, and we know that. We are prepared for that. We are prepared for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"So, I think there is no favorites. Definitely I think we are not favorites in this series. I think they're not either. I think it's just the Finals. There is no favorites in the Finals, in my opinion."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,You're going to see tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But we saw the zone. Definitely we didn't see this kind of zone because they are switching zones and they're really, really messing up the game in their favor. We just need to be focused and solid in what we are doing because that's why they are great, that's why they are winning, that's why they're in the Finals. They're messing the game in their way, and they're doing that really good."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know how it's going to affect me. We see tomorrow. Maybe going to have 10 turnovers, maybe going to have 10 points. We will see. Other assists."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Thank you, guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"Yes, I am glad to be home. I am on the best team in the NBA, I believe, and yeah. Hopefully you all enjoy the series as much as I plan to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"It's great. It's been 11 years removed for myself being in the Finals, just exciting especially to be at home and be part of this team. Just feel blessed to be welcomed where I was when I came over. We're glad that it's finally here. It's been a long time waiting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"Yeah, a different appreciation. I think I appreciate them all. You just try to live in the moment and enjoy it, but yeah, being a little bit older and being removed so long, a little bit different appreciation for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"I wasn't sure what team I'd be playing for, but I thought I'd be playing in the NBA Finals every year, so I'm just blessed to be in my second one in my 12 seasons. I know how few and far in between they come, so I'm just thankful."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"No, no such thing as leveling up. Great quote You do not rise to the level of the occasion, you sink to the level of your training. I think that's all that shows. Usually, the best players in usually every sport, the best at their craft usually last because they put the work in, so we get to see minor fruits of their labor, but we don't get to see their complete true excellence because, like I said, you sink to the level of your training."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"These guys have been putting in the work all day they're showing, and they've been playing amazing. This team has been playing amazing. I'm proud and I'm blessed to be part of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,I've got a series to figure it out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"Special. It's special. Their connection is amazing. They've been together for an amount of years. They've played each other's positions growing up, so I think just having the spectrum of Jokic starting from one, growing up and now being a five, playing like a point-center, and having Jamal starting as a big and now he's a point guard, going through that spectrum, I think they get to see the game in so many different ways. Like I said, they were special already coming in years ago, so getting to see their continuity and how it's built is just amazing. It's hard to stop. It's been fun. It's been tough playing against it in my career, and it's been fun now being a part of it and watching."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,I definitely rep 719. I'm from Earth.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"It just prepared me for the NBA life, moving every two, three years when you're traded. Hearing the rumors, it doesn't really faze you. You've been the new kid your whole life, so you find solace in being yourself and being alone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"It's been fun. They had a good season. Yeah, I don't know if the NBA is going to be making too much money off of me buying seats."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"It's been fun to watch. It's been fun to watch. I think he leads through action, leads through example by the way he comes in and prepares each and every day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,REGGIE JACKSON,"Extremely great basketball mind, so he implements himself at times being the coach by what he sees on the court. He doesn't do too much, he just strives, I think, for excellence, and he just holds people accountable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"It feels amazing to be here. I always dreamed about this as a kid, so it's going to be fun. Nobody gave us a shot, but we knew we could get here somehow, some way. So, excited to be here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Like I said before, it feels amazing. I'm going to say that word a lot, obviously, ""amazing."" Everybody had different journeys getting here. Everybody got here with different paths. But now that we're here, we're excited to be here. I'm excited to be here. Just ready. Ready to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Game 7 is one of the best two words in the NBA. It was a great game against the Celtics. I dreamed of playing in Game 7s growing up both when I was younger, so it's pretty cool. I'm glad we got the win, but it's past us now and now we're focused on the Nuggets."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, they see something in us that nobody else saw in us as undrafted guys, kind of like hidden gems. They believe in us, and they do a great job with developing us and taking us up under their wing and just making us be the best players we can be. They just do a great job all around."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm a junior, so it was my father's name. You'd have to ask his father, but he's not alive right now. I don't know the story behind it, honestly."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I've heard it's like an old name. I've heard it's a last name, too. So yeah, I don't know. I'm a junior. I don't know the story behind it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I've heard that. Yeah, I don't know. Just my father's last name, as well. I don't know. I guess I've got like H's in my family or something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"My father is from Kingsville, Maryland, so it's like Baltimore County."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"No, we have no concern at all. No excuses around here. We still feel fresh. We got two days off after Game 7, so we've got no excuses from us at all."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"Yeah, I wasn't in the bubble, so I can't really speak from my personal experience how it was. But I'm pretty sure it was not the same, playing in front of fans, just playing in the type of environment, like Mile High City or Miami where it's going to be. It's going to be fun. It's going to be exciting. A lot of energy in the building, so it's definitely going to be different than the bubble."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,Good. Good. Excited. Excited about the opportunity. Great to be back here in the Finals. Looking forward to it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,"No, I kind of just figured I'd take it one year at a time. You know what I mean? Stay in shape, work hard, let my body communicate with me about how long I can do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,"I think now I see the leadership. I see the culture. I see everything. When you watch Bam, when you watch Max, you watch Gabe, they don't need me any more. You know what I'm saying? You saw it in the Finals. You saw these guys grow up right in front of your eyes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,"I have been part of the process, I know what they put in to get to this point. But I think the world has seen those guys grow up right in front of their eyes. My work is done as a leader."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,"No, no. The impact that I have with these guys is because I'm not a coach, because I can practice with these guys, because I can go through the drills, because I can go through the grueling hours, understand all of that. That's why I have the impact."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,"The reverse part of that, what people don't understand, if I'm out of shape, not capable of keeping up, they don't listen to me. I have been able to set the tone, compete at a high level for these guys to understand or respect what I'm saying."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,"Enjoy it. Enjoy it, man. Enjoy this moment. That was one of my messages in the last series. If we get over this hump, you guys have no idea how enjoyable that next round will be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,"I'm at this point in my career, just this point in my life, where I think memories are the most valuable things you're going to have. I've had the money, all these different things. None of that really matters. I think memories are priceless and I want these guys to create as many memories as possible right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"Man, what it takes? Dedication, passion, sacrifice. You got to do the right things to be in this position obviously. You got to be for the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"I think all those qualities UD has. He's shown me those qualities. That's why I'm in the position today. He's been a good mentor, friend of mine for a while. Watching him from afar, seeing how he's went about his business."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"Also, I live in Miami, so seeing his work from afar. Studying that allowed me to get in this position. I just took it and put it to my use, now I'm in the position I am in today. I just try to relay that message to the young guys to be in this league for a long time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"I seen a lot of growth in there, maturity obviously. When we were in Orlando together, he was young, still trying to find his footing in this league. But now I see, like I said, a much more mature Aaron who is simplifying his game, not trying to do too much but be effective in his pursuit of the game, letting the game come to him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"I think his defense has been tremendous. I think his focus is starting there, and he's allowing that to carry over to the offensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"Aaron, he's a workaholic. He's somebody that has worked on his game a lot to get to this point. He's a big X factor for us, what he brings to this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"I've seen a lot of growth in him wanting to be in this position. For me, I think he's one of the best two-way players in this league. I don't think he get enough credit for that. He deserves to be where he's at right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"I won those, by the way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"I love Kyle to death, man. He's been a good friend of mine. He's somebody who is a true competitor. Like you say, since college. Like I said, I won a lot of those games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JEFF GREEN,"He brings the best out of you. He's going to guard, compete to the high level. I've been loving his game ever since college, since he got in the league, how he plays, his approach to the game. I think I have a good record against him, so I got to keep that going."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"My bigger brother has been there every step of the way. We battled on the basketball court, on and off the floor. And he is just somebody that has been so solid and kept it so real with me from day one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,I cant even really answer that in just such a short amount of time. I would need so much time to elaborate on how my big brother has been there and shaped my life and shown me what to do and what not to do. How to move. How to act. How to hold yourself. Made me tough. Big bro made me tough when it comes down to it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"I dont know. What would you suggest? I guess just play fast. Play for all 48 minutes. Yeah, just play faster."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"Always be deeply present. I think that is a reward in its own right. Just be in the moment, enjoying this, regardless of the outcome, regardless of what happens. Just being present with my brothers out there battling, attempting to bring how a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,Staying out of foul trouble is going to be really crucial. Jimmy does a great job of seeking contact and getting the refs to make a decision.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"I've said it before, I'll say it again I think out of everybody that you mentioned, I think Jimmy could potentially be the most complete player out of those guys. That's saying a lot. As far as the offensive package, the defensive package, the in-between too -- the transition, the cuts, the offensive rebounds. He can shoot the three. He can make the three. He can make the middie. He can get to the cup. And he does it through 48 minutes. He is a difficult cover, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"To stay out of foul trouble is huge. Jimmy is also a really smart player. I know he's going to try to get the switch a lot so I'm not the primary defender. I'm just going to do my best to make it difficult with him. Use my size, continue to use my physicality and use my speed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"That is my brother. Jeff is my big bro. We played in Orlando together. Different opportunity, different circumstances."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"Coming back together, this organization has been a blessing. Just to see eye-to-eye, relearn each other, just know that you have a brother in the locker room, for real."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"He gives me little advice and tidbits here and there, texts before the games. It's just all encouraging. Just the belief that we have in each other is amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"I used to watch Jeff Green growing up. I've always been a fan of his game forever. He's an incredible talent. Just an awesome dude to have on the floor and in the locker room, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"That's a real thing, a reoccurring theme in my life. Just overworking to the point of diminishing returns smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"It's like working so much to the point where now it's game time and now I have a nagging injury or a nagging ailment or something like that. I'm finally taking the needle off of that broken record. I've conserved enough energy, made sure I stayed in the right rhythm."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"That's how I've always been, been a workhorse. I try to be the hardest-working player on the team, which is hard in this organization. There's a lot of really hard workers. Not an easy task."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"Now it's just about trusting the work that I have put in from that point, from before that, up until now. Like I said before, just the presence, the moment, letting it all go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"Jimmy is not like a crazy talker. He doesn't talk too wild. I think he talks, if you start with him, if he gets rolling, he might start chirping a little bit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"I think what gets under people's skin about Jimmy is his calm and collectedness. Through 48 minutes, he's very poised and he's very calm. I think that's really what irks other people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"Not long at all. Didn't take me long at all. It's an amazing luxury for a center, for Nikola, big fella like himself, being able to just see the floor. He sees everything on the floor, everyone before it even happens."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,"If you double-team, he can pass over the top of the double team. He can pass with his left hand, right hand, off a spin. He always keeps the defense off balance. You always have to be ready to shoot, ready to score. That's one thing that I've learned."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,AARON GORDON,It was almost like clockwork when I came in because I love to play like that. I love to cut. I love to get out of the defender's vision and make him pay for that. So it's been a blessing.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Been preparing all week. Just getting treatment, getting our bodies ready to go tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But just trying to get through this day as quickly as possible, try to stay focused on what's at task. That's four more wins to be NBA champions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, they've been doing pretty much a great job of that themselves. For me, it's all about just we've been sitting for a long time. We're going to be a little bit jittery, anxious to play. Just trying to keep them calm, knowing the first couple possessions are going to be a lot, even for myself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm feeling anxious right now to even get out there. But just try to keep them calm, stay focused on what's at task, like I said."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, this is my third playoff appearance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I've seen it before. It can happen. You can slip into just getting comfortable because there's that many days off.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But for us, it was more just getting in the gym, doing something, even if were not practicing, just doing treatment, free throws, shots, whatever it is, just to get out of the house, do something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It works for us. We focus, were ready. Just excited for tomorrow."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Every series we play, they are tough opponents. They play hard regardless of what it is. This Miami team, just by watching them throughout the Playoffs, theyre relentless. They dont give up. They are going to play 48 minutes and we have just got to be prepared for it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"The bubble wasnt bad. Like you said, no media there, no nothing, just basketball, which was exciting as well. But being here, able to have the fans and everyone here, doing media. This is exciting as well too, because I didnt get a chance to experience the media aspect and play in front of thousand of fans screaming. Like I said earlier, Im excited and just happy to be here in this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Yeah, when they went up 3-0, we thought the series was done. But Boston is a great team and they fought back tremendously from 3-0 to tie the series up. We didnt know who we were going to get at that point once Boston started winning so we just started preparing for both teams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Guarding him as a team with all five guys. He does everything so well, and we're going to have to be in the gaps, we're going to have to gang rebound. We can't have defensive lapses. We're just going to have to get after it. I think at the end of the day, he's a major key, as DJ Khaled would say, and we're going to have to lock in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Because we do it every single day, and we know what we're capable of. The outside individuals don't get the opportunity to see that, and I wish that y'all did because then you would see that the guys that we have on this team, on this roster, can really play some high-level basketball, and we're going to stay confident because, like I said, we're in the grind every single day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Guys have been out of the lineup all year long, guys step up, fill in, and do their job. We're never going to be surprised."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think so. I think there's a lot of, like, stuff about the whole situation that people don't understand, and I'll let that stay back there. But I don't think it has too much to do with anything, this thing in the past. It's high-level competition. But I will say I wasn't talking to Jokic. That wasn't my beef. Make sure you write that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,The individual who I was talking to definitely knew who I was talking to.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"I'm just -- I would like to say that I'm never rattled. I'm very calm. I'm very consistent in everything that I do, whether it's before the game, after the game, during the game, and I think when my guys look at me like that, they follow suit in every single way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"I love that about them because they're never shook. No matter what. We could be down, people can think that we're out, and all of a sudden we're right back in this thing and it's because we do the same thing every day. We love being around each other. We want to see each other succeed. We really do enjoy when each other play well, and we're going to continue to do that, never going to get rattled, and we're going to see where we end up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"So many of my former teammates have shaped me into this, quote-unquote, leader that you think that you see in front of you today. Not perfect or anywhere near it in any way, but I'm me. My style of ""leadership"" works here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"But more than anything, I've got to give a shout-out to D-Wade because he had always told me about the culture here and how it fits who I am, what I'm about and how I go about things. You see it everywhere it really is a match made in heaven. I love it here, and I hope to be here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"None of that. I was never that good at basketball growing up anyways, so me being in the NBA was so far out that I didn't think I would make it this far. I'm glad that I am here and I have the opportunity to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Maybe I'll hit a game winner like D-Wade. I think that would be really good. I'm not standing on no tables, but it would be really good to be D-Wade for a day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, we didn't have cable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"That's my guy, my brother forever. I miss him so much. I used to spend so much time here with him, watching him be great. He motivated me because his story is really, really incredible. Through everything that he's been through, to make it and do what he did for the Broncos. I actually have a lot of love for this city."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Like I said, I miss that guy. I wish he was here to sit courtside and watch me do my thing because we talked about this all the time, maybe not Denver versus my team, but just being able to watch me win a championship like he did."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Yes, he'd better be there. So Ney, I know you're looking somewhere. You'd better be there. But that's my guy, too."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Part of my routine on game days and off days is I watch all types of sports of people who inspire me to be great. He's one of them. So, I've probably seen each one of his highlight videos on YouTube way too many times, Sasha Alexander Zverev tennis, Carlito Carlos Alcaraz tennis, you go down -- Serena, everybody. I love greatness in any way that you view it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"He's obviously a close friend of mine, so I pay attention to him a lot. But with him in my corner, I think I'll be okay."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, I just be drinking some water, listen to some music. I think that's the formula, you've just got to listen to music, drink water, drink wine, play Spades and dominos."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Before Game 1, probably Dermot Kennedy honestly. He be having me grooving. Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Lauryn Hill, Kirk Franklin. You never know. But it's going to be something. Spice Girls. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"No, I'm not going to lie. I'm going to say nobody cares. You don't, either. I'm still expected to do my job at a high level if I take the floor, which I will."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"We're going to be okay. We're going to get the job done, bum ankle or not, and I'm not taking a follow-up, so don't do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"Honestly, I haven't seen paid attention to it just yet. I haven't lied to you. I've got a lot of time between after this media session and the game to really lock in on what I'm going to do to help this team win on both sides of the ball. But I'm going to play the right way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,JIMMY BUTLER,"If I'm not open, I'm going to pass the ball. I'm going to try to collapse the defense and create help, kick it to my open shooters, play basketball the right way, and know that this teams way of playing basketball is going to win it for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, my time at Miami was great. Coach L was one of the greatest coaches I've had. His practices were set up for me to get to the league. It was just like the league PD, then we'd get into our shell drill, stuff like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"I loved my time in Miami with him, as I said. I can't wait to see him when we get down there. He actually texted me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, he's extremely important. He was one of the reasons why I came. He told me exactly the role I was going to play. When I didn't see it, he saw it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"Without Jeff, I don't know if I would have been here or not. On and off the court, as I said, Jeff, when he was in Brooklyn, he was huge for me, just my mental and for the team. Him and D.J. have been great vets, just the way they carry themselves. They know how to be serious, when to make people laugh."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"They've been great. They've been amazing. Actually I think, what, second series, I forget who we were playing, the Suns or something. I was a little tired coming out. Then I ran out, I heard the roar. I was good, I was ready to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,I know it's going to be crazy in here Game 1 and Game 2. I can't wait for us to start tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"I definitely enjoyed it. I was talking smack in the locker room. You heard it all year -- Kansas is better than Miami, all these guys, whenever they went. I was screaming at the TV. I watched every game. Super excited for those guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"I worked out there all last summer, so I was around them a little bit. I was just super proud of them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it's great. I was talking to my people yesterday. I was like the last time I won something was in high school. So just to have the chance to be here at the highest level is just amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,I think we're ready. We've been there before. We've had a long break during All-Star. I think we'll be fine. There's no worries there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"There was no advice. He just said, See you in Miami. I texted him back, I'll see you there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"He's been texting me throughout the year saying congratulations, good luck, you've finally shown what you can do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"Coming into league, people were asking what position I would play. He said point guard. Not a lot of people believed that. As I said, I love Coach L."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, it would be great. I try to bring my winning ways everywhere I go, play extremely hard. Now to be the first time in Denver Nuggets history to reach the Finals, to be able to win, that would be insane. Hopefully we can do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, I played them a lot coming from the Eastern Conference. They play extremely hard. They pack the paint a lot, so we're going to have some open threes that we need to knock down. We've done that this year against them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,Bam is an extremely good defender. They might switch him three to five. They're not going to switch with Duncan. We know what we need to do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"From Dorchester, by the way smiling."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"But, yeah, there's not many people from Dorchester, Massachusetts, who make it on this level and be able to play at a good level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BRUCE BROWN,"It is crazy to take it all in. I haven't thought too much about it. I'm sure I'll think about it a lot after the series. But now, yeah, it's crazy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, it's been great. Obviously to your point with Remy, he's a great dude, and winning with him was fun. Just these however last many months it's been, it's been a good experience. Got to learn a lot, got to win a lot. Obviously, this is the biggest goal, though, and we're close to getting there, but we've got a long ways to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think it's a big deal for opposing teams especially. It's a big deal when you get here and getting used to it, but we've been here resting and waiting for enough days to get used to it, so I think it's a big deal for opposing teams to come in here and try to play at the pace we play for that long, especially in the Playoffs when guys are playing 45 minutes. It's hard for teams to keep up with our pace for that long."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Well, in my time on the court, I try to be as high energy as possible, and especially in the Playoffs. It's not as long. Just try to have energy, and I don't think that stuff at this point of the year affects you as much."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, it's been smooth. I think the Nuggets have really let me be me, and that's a big part of it. But the transition is different. There's a lot of things that are different. Preparation is different. Then just stepping into a higher level of basketball is different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think KU obviously helps you as much as you could possibly be helped, and then being there for a couple extra years also helps, playing at a National Championship level also helps."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's a lot of things that help you, but there's not much that can prepare you for this moment and these moments, but if there was a player that was prepared, I think it would be me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I've talked to him a little bit. He hasn't been able to get out here for a game yet, but my brother just committed there, to play his last year, so I've talked to him a little bit about that, too. He's a great guy, and I love him to death. He's done a lot for me, and I talk to him as much as I can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Man, he's great. Like his dedication to his craft, how he's bounced back from injury, no excuses, no complaints, comes in here every day, come back at night, he's in here again. Just his dedication to his craft and just the way you've seen him overcome injuries and things like that, and he's not playing at a normal level. He's playing at the highest level, and probably better than he's ever been in his career."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Just to see a guy work that hard and then to be through what he's been through, it's great to see his success."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Me and him are pretty close. We talk a lot in the locker room. Just to see his success is great for me, and we all really enjoy it when he's playing well, and the Nuggets are at their best when Jamal is playing his best, so I really enjoy watching him play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Well, I think he said a couple quotes in the last couple weeks, just like how much his family means to him. So, off the court, he's a big family man. Obviously, his daughter is a big part of his life, his wife. Just the way he treats people off the court, the way he treats his family I think is something that everybody can take away from him. Just a great guy, a genuine guy, and a guy that's obviously great at basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You can take a lot of things from him, but obviously those are things off the court you can definitely take from him is how caring, how genuine he is to the people around him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"Tough shots, difficult shots. Trying to get him in an uncomfortable zone and force him to take tough shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"Make him take tough shots, force him into tough shots, and live with the result. That's the biggest thing for me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"I feel like this is one of those series where he becomes very dangerous when you let his teammates get involved, and he can make those incredible passes and end up with 12 assists."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, we've definitely had moments in this run where people thought we couldn't do it. People thought we weren't going to make this, weren't going to do that. You know, when you've got the trust in your 15, the coaching staff and whoever is getting on that plane with you, when everybody believes and has a trust, I feel like you can do anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"If it ends in a win, it doesn't matter. You can talk about stats, you can talk about this guy did that, did this and that. But you know at the end of the day, they're going to remember the people who won."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,My mom. I know I talk about her a lot. I hope she doesn't call me during media.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"But it's been my mom because she's been a leader in my life, since I've been born. Seeing my mom go through every adversity, all the adversity she's been through, my mom walked to work, my mom was a single parent, we lived in a single wide trailer. I lived off of 12,000 a year from my mom. Having that type of person lead, I feel like it was just bound for me to be able to get in that mold."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"Definitely uncomfortable when you first start being -- when people start looking at you and saying you have to be more vocal, you have to be a leader of the ship. I just look back at those days how my mom just lived for me, and it was by example."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"I've always had that will to lead by example, but every moment in the moments of truth, I'll take the chair, and it counts for whatever it counts for, maybe once or twice a game, just depending on it. I feel like it's by example, and I'm the person that if you're going through something, I will come to you and talk to you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,Everybody has their different versions.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"A lot. I feel like that's been the biggest thing in a lot of series, not letting me be comfortable in the paint, get to my spots. So biggest thing for me is just watching film, making adjustments, and figuring it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, the swagger Caleb plays with. That's my biggest thing, because when he got here, he was truly quiet. Like Caleb was one of those people, he's like, it's like a morning person that doesn't talk in the morning, but he was like that all day. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"We'll be in practice and he'll maybe say three words, and the only reason he'll say those three words to me is because I've known Caleb since we've been in high school."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"Now seeing him communicate, talk, really be himself on the court, express himself, I feel like that's the biggest -- those are the biggest steps I've seen him make, and I'm truly proud of him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,BAM ADEBAYO,"I really look at film, not really analytics. But I definitely do watch film, look at tendencies, look at plays, see if I can see hand motions to see what types of plays they're running. Just the little things, the little details that you don't look at throughout a game, I try to find the little things in the film."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, as I told our team, forget the eight seed stuff. They beat Milwaukee 4-1. That team had the most wins in the NBA this year. They beat Boston 4-3 and they were up 3-0, the team with I think the second most wins in the NBA this year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"So, you get to the NBA Finals, it's not about seeding anymore, and for those who are thinking that this is going to be an easy series, I don't even know what to say to you people. This is going to be the biggest challenge of our lives. This is the NBA Finals. You're trying to win the first NBA championship in franchise history, and it's going to be the hardest thing that we've ever done, which is the way it should be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"But regarding the themes, obviously a couple things that jump out to me, they're leading the league, the Playoffs rather, in points off turnovers, close to 20 a night, and that's after, I think, 18 games played. So, it's pretty impressive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"On the other end of that is that we're No. 1 in fewest points allowed off of our turnovers. So that's a battle that's going to be really important, and we can't turn the ball over."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"We know how good they are on the defensive end. We've had a great offense, in large part because we are shooting the ball well and we're not turning the ball over, so that's really important in terms of not beating ourselves with turnovers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"The three-point line, you have the two best three-point shooting teams in the Playoffs, in the Finals. They're just ahead of us at 39 percent. Obviously, Jimmy and Bam attract so much attention, but you have to give so much credit to Caleb Martin, Gabe Vincent. We know Duncan Robinson is a great shooter, we know Max Strus is a great shooter. Tyler Herro will be back at some point. We know what he's capable of. Obviously, just been so impressed with Gabe Vincent, the poise and confidence he's playing with, and Caleb Martin could easily have won the MVP of that Eastern Conference championship. He's just shooting into a very big basket right now, playing with tremendous confidence, so the three-point defense will be really important in terms of us guarding that, and we've done a pretty good job of that throughout the regular season and the Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"With a guy like Jimmy, you've got to give him different looks. You cannot guard him with the same play or the same scheme over a game, over four quarters or a series. That's going to be a challenge to give him different looks and to keep him off the foul line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's third in the Playoffs in free throw attempts per game. I think they're at 9.1. We know a lot of their guys are real big shot fake players, so they're disciplined to stay down, be the second man off the floor. Give them one shot it's going to be really important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"The last thing I would say is that we have to continue to get out and run. We're second in the Playoffs in fast break points per game. In our two head-to-head meetings, we only averaged nine and a half fast break points against them, which is our third lowest against our 29 opponents."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Getting pace, getting fast break, getting attack, getting altitude into this series while home will be really important."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I've gone on record countless times, and I'll do it again. I feel really fortunate and blessed to be working in an organization run by Stan and Josh Kroenke. They gave me a chance eight years ago to lead this team, and the most important part of this last eight years is their ability to be patient and have a big-picture approach and let this thing grow into what it is today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"That is not normal in pro sports, not just the NBA. In all my conversations with Stan and Josh, they've won Super Bowls, they've won Stanley Cups. They've been around some great teams, great players. But I also know that they're basketball people. Josh was a hell of a player in his own right, and Stan will tell you he grew up a basketball fan."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is the one thing that is missing from their trophy case, and that's what motivates every one of us when we come into work every day is to bring home that first championship for this city, for our fans, for the Kroenkes, for our players, and we know we have a hell of a fight in front of us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, you could get into the basketball, the skill level. For me, when I look at Jimmy Butler, what separates him from most players is the drive, the competitive spirit within him, a relentless attack."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"It was really cool seeing the press conference they showed from last year when they lost and how everything he talked about in that moment kind of came to fruition a year later, and he has this team back in the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think what makes Jimmy hard to guard is we know he's talented, he's big, he's strong, he can get to his spots on the court, but he has the gift of drawing fouls and getting to the free throw line. But he's a big-moment player. He's not scared. He's tough. He's relentless, and he's a warrior."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's why from the first -- from the Play-In games to that first-round series against a really good Milwaukee team with great defensive players, like Jrue Holiday said, it didn't matter who was guarding him, Jimmy was going to get where he wanted to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,It's not just on Aaron Gordon it's on all five guys on the floor to try to slow him up and to give him different looks. We'll be ready.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I mean, you see it all throughout the season when teams come in here. The altitude is real. I think they got in late last night, so they're going to try to acclimate as quickly as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's somebody that embodies our culture, and the beginning of that is work. Self-motivated players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,Thanks for listening and paying attention.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think that's a great question and an interesting one because three, four years ago, the number one pick-and-roll combo in the entire NBA was Nikola and Jamal, and most people would just assume that it was Nikola setting for Jamal. It was actually the opposite. It was Nikola handling and Jamal setting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"The reason it was so effective, aside from the obvious, two really talented players, is that Jamal is big, strong, physical, and not afraid of contact. Some guys like to slip out of every screen because they don't want to make that contact, they don't want to give themselves up. Jamal from early in his career here, he's shown that he's willing to go and set a screen on a big guy, small guy, doesn't matter, because he's tough."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, the second part of that is he also knows that if Nikola has the ball and he screens, his man has to help, which will give him separation. If you want to simplify the game of basketball, it comes down to separation. The great individual players, the great offensive teams find ways to create it, and the great one-on-one defenders and the great teams find a way to negate it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Jamal realizes when he sets great screens, whether it's on Nikola or anybody else, that's going to allow him to maybe create some separation and pop for a jump shot or a drive, and Nikola, Aaron and Jamal have really good synergy within that three-man game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think it definitely is a delicate balance in that regard. But for me, it's just getting back to work, and we've had a great week of practice leading into today. It was nice to finally know who we were playing so we could speak about a lot more detail and specifics with the Miami Heat and their personnel and their coverages and their plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"But for our guys having been off as long as we have been, I think we're just excited to play again, and it happens to be in the NBA Finals, which is pretty cool. But the message all along has been, yes, enjoy it, enjoy this city. Last time we had this we were in the bubble. We didn't get a chance to experience any of this. We were all the way down in Orlando."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"But also, don't get bored with success and don't listen to everybody telling you how great you are because we haven't accomplished anything yet, and we're playing against a team that has been playing every other day, and they're on a mission, we're on a mission, and that's why it's going to be a hell of a series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Everybody that's been here in my eight years has been a part of this. You mentioned a guy like Tim Connelly I wouldn't be the head coach in Denver if it wasn't for Tim Connelly. He was here for seven of my eight years, and his fingerprints are all over this team. So yes, Tim Connelly is a part of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"You mentioned guys that have been on my staff. Everybody that's ever come in these doors and helped me, helped our players, helped this organization, they're a part of it. Every player from year one when I came in like Emmanuel Mudiay and Gary Harris and Kenneth Faried and Jusuf Nurkic and Wilson Chandler, Randy Foye, Danilo Gallinari. I could sit here and -- it's been a long list in eight years, man. But they're all a part of it. They helped us get here. You had to lay a foundation. You had to go through growing pains."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,The players in that locker room right now are reaping a lot of the hard work and sacrifice that those other players and coaches gave to this team and organization.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"So yes, this is for everybody that's come through here, and I love the fact that after one of the press conferences Jamal Murray unsolicited talked about Gary Harris, talked about Monte Morris, talked about the guys who were so instrumental in his early years here, and I think that's a great mindset let's not forget where we came from and give thanks to those that helped us get to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, it's going to take a full team effort. It's not just on a starting five. We wouldn't be here in the NBA Finals if it wasn't for contributions from everybody, whether that's leading into practice, whether that's a guy like Thomas Bryant going out there and being the best version of Bam Adebayo as a scout team player, and I mean that sincerely. Everybody has got a job to do and do it to the best of your abilities."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"But also look at the contributions of guys like Bruce Brown, Jeff Green, Christian Braun. Those have kind of been the three guys off our bench that we've played in our eight-man rotation, and each one of those players has had a huge impact in us being 12-3 at this point as we approach Thursday night and Game 1."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,"The other thing I'll say is in any given series, there's always curve balls. You never know who's going to play. Somebody who has not played a ton of minutes leading up to this point could be a guy that maybe helps us win a game, win a quarter, win a possession, and when you get to the NBA Finals, every possession matters."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,MICHAEL MALONE,We don't have just eight players on our team. We have 17 guys in that locker room that I love and care about and that are a part of us getting to this point of the season.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"Yes and no. I mean, a lot of things that -- it's more feeling and being in the moment. A lot of things you carry over to the Finals when the Finals start. For me I was stuck in the moment of just making it to the Finals instead of actually enjoying the moment of being there and playing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,But it's nothing you really take over. It's just about accepting where you're at and being prepared.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"A lot of respect. They've created a culture. It's their way. It works. They established something that's been beneficial to them, that's gotten them to places over and over and over that a lot of teams haven't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"Much respect to them. Much respect to Spo, how he gives his guys confidence to go out there and produce no matter who's on the floor, and obviously Pat is Pat. He's been doing his thing in this league for a long-a-- time. You've got to give respect where respect is due."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"Honestly, I don't know what they're going to do. This is a question for them. I know we're prepared for what they bring to the table. You watch their game, and they play zone. They play hard-nosed man-to-man. They can play all different type of ways."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,But we have to make sure that we're prepared and we execute whatever we're trying to do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, at the end of the day it's just about playing with effort. We did what we had to do in the Playoffs to get to this point, and that came with rest. Our job is to go out there and execute, play hard, and try to get the win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"Rust, I don't think nobody on our team has even thought about it. I think Coach did a great job of making sure that we stayed well-conditioned through the practices that we had, and when the game time comes, everybody is going to get tired. Like we can't control that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,But our job is to go out there and play with effort and play with pace and play Denver Nuggets basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, one scenario is just a lot of up-and-down. Probably one of those scenarios, 5-on-5 scenarios. That's pretty much it. Without giving you a long breakdown of every practice, high intensity, throwing every kind of scenario at us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"All I can say is he did a great job, without going into too much detail."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"The adjustment of going from player to player, and it's not -- you just named three guys from each series, but Aaron has been guarding multiple guys each series. It's not just the guys that you singled out. He's been doing a good job of understanding the assignment of who he's guarding but also knowing personnel, if there's a switch, but I think he's been doing a tremendous job. He's part of the reason why we're here. It starts with defense, and he's the head of the snake on that defensive end and the pressure that he puts on their main guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"Our job is to try to make plays for each other, try to find open spots, just try to make the right reads. How they play with their zone, they do different things within their zone, obviously, so our job is just to be aggressive and make plays."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"Thank you, first of all. Great question. How do I look at my journey? Man, long story short, I'm proud of myself, from all the obstacles that I've been through in my career. Like you said, the obstacle that I faced 10-plus years ago, not allowing those type of things to hold me back, breaking barriers down, multiple teams, adapting to every circumstance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"To be at this point, 16 years of my career, I'm happy. I'm excited. This is a blessing. It shows the hard work. Whether people want to look at it or not, with all I've been through, which everybody knows, to be at this point, being productive, giving something on a great team in the Finals, I think it's amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,I'm proud of myself on how I got to this point and accomplished some of the things I wanted to do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"It's everything. This is what I play for. For me, I always play for team first, and ultimate goal was to always win a championship. It would be everything. Like I said, with everything I've been through in my career, to win a championship is everything, and for the city of Denver, same thing. I'm pretty sure that they're excited for this. Long-awaited for this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,JEFF GREEN,"We go out there, we play for the city of Denver, and we're going to give them everything we have in order to bring that championship home. We're looking forward to the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, we have player personnel sheets and booklets essentially that we can go through and study players' tendencies, what their strengths are, what they like to get to, how they're most effective. Then I just kind of go through that, treat it like a Bible for the next couple of days and just stick to the script."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, I came into the league as a defender. I tell all the young guys coming into the league, find a niche that is going to help you stay in the league, and my niche was defense. It's been there. I've been able to develop it and kind of fine-tune it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,But I'm most excited about just helping my team. I'm not really worried about showing the world anything. I do it for the guys that are in the locker room.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"If I can take on that task of guarding the best player night in and night out and make it easier for the guys around me so they can focus on their jobs, so be it every time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"It's not really about overhauling as much. It's just reading the game. These guys are such great players, such great players in this locker room and playing on the floor, that you just have to make the right read. You've got to be in the right spot every time and do what the game is asking of you. I've gotten to play in the dunker spot a lot, so that's what I love to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"We've got the utmost respect for them. They fight and they scrap, and they have no quit in them. They play through 48 minutes a game and more if necessary. They play fearless. They play disciplined. They're well coached and have some guys that have been there before and have some guys that have chips on their shoulder."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"We're not looking at the seeding or the story around it. This is a very talented basketball team, professional basketball team, and all those guys over there got game. So we respect it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Oh, man, just how much I appreciate KCP and Brucie B. chasing around guards. Trying to guard a lot in that Warriors series between Klay and chasing around Steph a little bit and then switching to Draymond, there was just a lot. We got some defenders on this team, some two-way guys. It's nice to have those guys around and locked in on the defensive end."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Then just the physicality of the game, understanding that there's going to be some fouls that don't necessarily get called, but it cannot deter you from attacking the rim and attacking the game every single time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"A lot of drive-and-kick, a lot of drive-and-kick and a lot of slips. They work the clock. They use all 24 seconds of it to find the best shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"They play good to great. It's going to get you a higher percentage. They do that time in and time out. Every possession, they play good to great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Oh, I mean, we've been working. It's not like we've got our feet kicked back or our hands back and our feet kicked up. We've been working. We've been locked in in the gym, working diligently."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,We feel like we're in a good space. It's been a good balance of work to rest. Happy we have home-court advantage.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, the altitude actually, it is an advantage. It plays a difference. I remember when I was in Orlando and coming to play against Denver, it was difficult just to get your first and second wind."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"But that team is full of fighters. That team is excuseless. They don't make excuses, and they will not use that as an excuse. Honestly, we're just going to play our game and try and run them and play the way that we know how to play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"You always want to keep home court. So first and foremost, it's what we worked for all season long, to have that home-court advantage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"But I've been telling my guys all year, we don't want the easy route. We don't want anything easy. We want to be great. Miami is the best team out of the East, and that's what we want."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, Jimmy is a difficult cover for different reasons than the guys I've guarded in the past like KD and LeBron, KAT. Jimmy does everything. He does all the intangible things. He gets out in transition. He gets cuts. He gets offensive rebounds. He gets backdoors. He gets spin-outs. He does a lot of the game within the game, as well as being really skilled. He's a difficult cover."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Just make it tough for him, play without fouling to the best of my ability and just compete. That's really what it comes down to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"I think it's lethal because of their ability to score from all three levels. It's rare. It's really rare that you can have a guard and a big that can both shoot the three, both score in the mid range with the floater and attack the rim. It's very rare. You don't see it often at all."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Of course I watched the Finals. It's just an awesome feeling. It's amazing. I'm doing it for everybody that has ever helped me in my life, doing it for the people around me. And just proving us right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"It's hard to put into words how amazing this experience is. Playing basketball at the highest level is a blessing, and I'm doing everything in my power to continue to receive those blessings for myself, my family and my team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"The key to going up against a zone is, well, good shooting. That always helps. If you've got some lethal shooters out there, you can shoot people out of the zone. Ball movement, patience, attacking the zone, the middle of the zone. Really, the middle of the zone. That's what unlocks it all. If you get in the middle of the zone, everything else kind of unlocks. Oh, yeah, offensive rebounding against the zone, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I mean, he's been going crazy. I don't really set targets for like points. I just want to make it as difficult as I possibly can for him all night long for 48, through an entire series. Just making everything that he gets tough. Make him work for everything. It's not like a one one-on-one. Basketball is a five-on-five game, and it's going to be a five-man defense out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Just make him work and, like I said, just make it tough, not necessarily worry about the points. If he gets to his 27 mark but he takes however many shots, it's a win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Just do what we've been doing all year Take care of our home floor. We've been great on our home floor all year long, and we don't expect that to change. We want to be disciplined through 48, have energy, play hard. If we can play smart for 48 minutes, I believe we'll come out of here with a W."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think really just keep our head down and stay focused. Took a couple days of rest and just watched these games. Know we could play either team. But no, just keeping our head down and staying focused until we get this ring."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, definitely try to take time to reflect and be grateful. I've been journaling, things like that. I try to do gratefulness journaling and just reflect during this journey on all the things there are to be grateful for, but at the same time just stay hungry, keep working, never let up. At the same time, you've got to take moments to reflect, I think. That makes it worth it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I think they're both really good teams in their unique ways. Boston is obviously very talented all the way through their whole roster. Got a lot of guys who can play. So you can't really take any of their guys lightly because they all are hoopers.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Miami is just very gritty. I think both teams are scoring around 20 points off of other teams' turnovers. We're emphasizing taking care of the ball and things like that. But they both present a unique set of challenges. We'll see tonight who we play. Neither team is a rollover. Obviously they're both very good teams, so looking forward to seeing who we play tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think just the same as he's always been. I think all our guys are really doing the same things we always have. We just have everyone healthy at this point. I think that's really the big difference between now and previous years, is just health. But no one has changed who they are during the playoffs. No one has tried to do things they haven't done all year. I think really that's the key, was just all of us being healthy and being able to play as a group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, I don't know. I wouldn't really say the word is like ""proud of."" I don't really look at myself like I've really made humongous leaps in any area. I still have a long ways to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I appreciate when people say that, but I definitely have a long way to go and a long way that I know that I can reach. I wouldn't really say that I look at anything from the past year and am excited about it. I just keep trying to get better every day."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think we've been pretty consistent as a team throughout the entire Playoffs. Every team we've played has been a little bit different Minnesota, then Phoenix, then L.A."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"The game plan has been a little different, where guys are getting their shots. But as a team, as a group, we've stayed pretty consistent and together through this whole thing. That's not going to change."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I mean, Trae, me and Trae Young have talked a lot. He's jealous since I'm in the Finals and he's only made the Eastern Conference Finals. We were talking about that in L.A.. He came to our last game in L.A."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"And then Brandon Roy, my coach from high school, yeah, he called me the other day and he pretty much was just criticizing everything that I was doing. I think he's jealous, too, because he never made it to the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But those two dudes.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"B-Roy still gives me lots of advice. He was my coach in high school, so he sees kind of how my game has evolved since my injuries and things. He gives me great advice as a good mentor to me. But I would say those two have been the ones that have been in touch the most."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"It's definitely been a long wait. It seems like we haven't played a game in forever. So we've just been trying to stay in shape, stay in the gym and just wait and see who we play. We thought we would have known a while ago, but the Celtics, they're making history right now. They're being very resilient. I'm very excited to see how tonight's game goes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But we're not really hoping for either team because they're both great teams. We've just got to see what happens.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"That shot, that was one of the craziest endings to a game I've seen. Jimmy Butler getting fouled on that three and then Derrick White hitting that buzzer beater."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, the Celtics are feeling really good about themselves, so it'll be interesting about tonight. We know both of those teams play with extreme confidence. It's just going to be a fun Finals either way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, it's definitely -- it's still a process because I still -- I'm able to play and contribute, which is the things that I said earlier I got to be grateful for. But I still feel like there's a lot of boxes I can still tick, growth I can still achieve, just in rehab in general and feeling better. But I've definitely made strides throughout the year. During the entire year I was kind of almost -- I was rehabbing simultaneously and like playing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I feel good at this point. There are some things that I'm doing different this time around to try to just keep my back in check and everything. But like someone said earlier, it could get taken away from anybody any day, so really just trying to stay in the moment and take it day by day and do my work every day and leave the rest up to God, for real."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think you definitely have to do that with this eight- or nine-day break, try to just find ways to make yourself go harder than a normal practice, just to make sure you're kind of in shape. Trying to create game shots in the flow of practice, normal pace, game pace. Then I've been doing different conditioning things just to try to stay in shape."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"It's a little different when you're not playing games every other day to try to stay in basketball shape, but we should be good. We've been practicing pretty hard, things like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of Melo. He was one of my favorite players growing up, and we've actually developed a relationship off the court. When I was in New York for that little stretch we had against Brooklyn and the Knicks, we ran into each other and just chopped it up. He told me come kick it with him in the offseason, come out there and work out with him for a little while. So that's definitely something I might do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I'm a big fan of his and his legacy. That's definitely one of the guys I looked up to growing up, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, he's handling it as well as any rookie could. He's already a valuable piece of this team and he's just a rookie. I told him, you can't trip about playing a lot some games and -- it doesn't matter how good you are as a rookie on a good team it's hard to get minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"He already has a very good foundation as a player on this team, so going forward he's obviously a big part of this team. He knows that to be able to play as a rookie in the Playoffs, guard some of the best players in the world, is pretty dope. He just brings a winning culture. They won in Kansas."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,I knew Christian growing up. He played with my little brother. So it's really good to have him on the team.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Seattle definitely had a big impact. I feel like growing up in Missouri and then moving out to Seattle and being around all those pros and getting coached by Brandon Roy, that was when I really took my game to the next level. He helped me just get better every day and eventually become the best player in the country on the best team in the country."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"That was his first year coaching, which is kind of crazy. I think he's won like four state championships since I left Seattle. He's just a good friend of mine to this day. He loves basketball. He's just a really good dude."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Seattle definitely has a big piece of my heart, and that was definitely a dope time in my life."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"They don't. No, I'm playing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think he's the longest -- correct me if I'm wrong, he's been here the longest out of all the staff. He's pretty much been here the longest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"He's just the OG around here. He's just a goofy dude. He gives me encouragement before games, and we have our inside jokes. I'm pretty close with him out of all the staff and the whole organization. Me and Sparky are pretty close."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"He's definitely just a big part of our team culture, always bringing the upbeat attitude. Even though he's an equipment manager, he doesn't have to be that joyful every day, but he brings that good energy to the Ball Arena, and we just love that dude. He's definitely a big part of what we've got going on here, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Calvin is my guy, too. He's a real chill dude, real laid-back dude, but he does what needs to get done on that side. We have a good relationship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Obviously I think it's pretty well known now the guys he brought in are a huge part of the reason why we're in the Finals. Obviously KCP and Bruce being two of those guys. But really the vets, too, as much as the guys on the floor are contributing to us winning, like DJ, Jeff, Ish, Reggie. Those guys' attitude and their leadership is just part of the reason why we're doing so well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,It's really just finding a group of guys that mesh in the locker room is a big part of winning. I think Calvin did a great job of that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I just think I would say my family, really. Just their encouragement. Them being at the games, wherever that is, L.A., Phoenix. They've been flying to the games to watch me play. We've got a family group chat. That's always the first thing I check after games, see what they were saying during the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think just having a family like that, seven brothers and sisters, I'm really lucky in that area. So I'd say my family, for sure."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Early in the season. I don't have an exact date, but I felt that Michael was fully back. I felt this was by far his best season as an NBA player. The commitment he made to being the best defensive player he could be and buying into that end was definitely evident early on, as well as was his commitment to being the best offensive player he could be and playing without the ball and moving without the ball and spacing the floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Obviously Jamal missed a lot more time than Michael, but I think for me with Michael, I could tell early in the season that he was poised to have a very good season. He was moving well, he was healthy and that was all we needed from him because he's such a talented player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"I mean, I think that makes for a great story, but I don't know if it's entirely accurate. I think throughout the year, not just the Playoffs, he's picked his spots in terms of when to be vocal, when to challenge his teammates."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Game 3 was just, hey, here's something we can do offensively, which is great. But I think it's even more important when we're playing at Houston and he calls the guys together before the game starts in warmup lines because he doesn't like how we're warming up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, you know, all year long the one thing I've talked about with Christian is that he's a winner. The guy has won at every level, and here he is in the NBA Finals. It's kind of staying true to form for Christian Brown."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then as a rookie, game 2 at Golden State, he plays and he plays well because Jamal didn't play in that game. I think that's when we all realized that for a young player playing against the defending world champions on the road, he wasn't afraid. That really stuck out to me. Most young kids, they get in a situation or environment like that, they're going to be a little bit over their head, and he wasn't."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"All season long, Christian has been a pro in regard to staying ready. Am in the rotation? Am I not in the rotation? I'm not going to allow that to take away from my work ethic and my dedication to my craft."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then obviously the last two months of the year, whatever it was, he was a rotational player for the No. 1 team in the West. He's done his job in the Playoffs. He's gone out there and defended, rebounded, ran the floor, moved without it. He's never afraid of the moment, which you have to appreciate for such a young kid."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, it's definitely been a challenge because while these two other teams are going to a Game 7 and it's been great theater from afar because Miami is up 3-0 and now it's going back to Boston for a Game 7 -- yesterday we took off, but all the practices leading into it were about us, with a real heavy emphasis on conditioning, pace, purpose and just working on all the things that we need to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then today we started working on things that both Miami and Boston, kind of things that we need to be prepared for, both offensively and defensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"The best thing about tonight is we're going to finally know who we play, and that gives us Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday morning to get ready for Game 1."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, I think if I'm the same coach I was in year one, then I've failed. That wasn't meant for laughs. Thank you in the front row."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think for all of us, everybody sitting in this room, if you're the same person that you were from a year ago, not even just eight, then we've all failed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"I challenge myself to continue to grow, and not just as a coach but in all facets of life. If you're not growing and improving, then you're probably getting worse."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, there's no doubt in my mind that I am a much different coach than I was in year one. I think eight years in, I think for me, you kind of don't coach every dribble. You don't win and lose with every win or loss. It's not life and death."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"You try to pick your spots when you need to be emotional. It can't be every game, it can't be every halftime, it can't be every postgame. But over the years I've challenged myself to look in the mirror, be honest with myself, listen to those around me and become the best version that I can be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"And by the way, I think I've given him the ball for a long time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I have to give so much credit to Stan and Josh Kroenke. When we beat L.A. the other night in L.A., I loved the fact that they were there and part of that celebration. I often allude to my third season, that game 82 at Minnesota when we lost. We won 46 games, but we lost an overtime game to go to the Playoffs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Probably 80, 90 percent of pro sports teams probably would have said, we have to pivot here, we have to go in a different direction. I can remember after that game being really dejected and down because we failed in that quest. But John Kroenke came over to me and put his arm around me and was so excited. He talked about look at how well our young players Nikola and Jamal just played in the play-in tournament before the play-in tournament."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the fact that they had the ability to be patient and take a step back and have a big-picture approach, we had the chance to do something special if we let this continue to grow and develop and mature. So, yes, I think trusting the process, I think being patient, and that's what all the great sports teams over the last 50 years, regardless of the sport -- you look at teams like the Steelers, they've had three coaches in seems like 70 years."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"The programs that change a coach every year or two never get off the ground. You have to let something take root, let it grow, go with the growing pains and hopefully it blossoms into something like we've seen here in Denver."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the way we've done it, I hear from a lot of people saying, we want to be like the Denver Nuggets. We want to draft well. We want to have our players develop, add the right pieces around them, be patient and see where it goes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"This has been really fun to be a part of that process. I can't thank the ownership, front office enough for being as patient as they have been."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Nobody wants to hear my coaching takeaways. That was a crazy ending. Obviously that game was won and lost quite a few times in the last three minutes. At one point Boston looks like they're going to win going away by double figures. Then Jimmy Butler gets to the foul line. Al Horford fouls a three-point shooter. Great challenge by Joe Mazzulla because even though they don't win the challenge, they put the time back on the clock, which allows Derrick White to have the time to get that put-back in before the final buzzer. That's why you always preach to your players, you've got to play for 48 minutes. That game right there is a perfect example of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know I speak for everybody in that locker room, we just can't wait for tonight's game to be over, to finally have some clarity, so when we wake up tomorrow morning we know who we're playing, we know who we're preparing for and we can kind of turn the page and really focus in on that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,The Eastern Conference Finals has been a hell of a series. I think this is the first time where a team has been down 3-0 to force a Game 7 and have home-court advantage. So we'll see if that plays a part. But I'm expecting another crazy game and ending in is Boston tonight.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"All that. For us obviously knowing we're going to be playing one of these teams and all week long with my coaching staff, we've been talking about both teams, the problems they present and the things that we have to be worried about. We always identify the themes going into each and every series, and they change depending upon who you're playing and what problems they present."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"We had a long meeting this morning, and tomorrow we'll have more clarity in that regard. But I watch it as a fan of the game. I watch it as a coach getting prepared to play Game 1 against one of those two teams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,But I allow my wife to come down once in a while to check on me. She's allowed down.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"What stands out for me is that because he's healthy, he's confident. When you're not healthy and you can't move and do the things that you're accustomed to doing, that really makes it hard to go out there and be confident in your game and what you're able to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"First and foremost with Michael being physically healthy, I think that is giving him the mental confidence to go out there and play the game at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think the series he had against the Lakers, just the scoring, the rebounding, the efficiency was a huge part of us sweeping L.A. in that Western Conference Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,But he's in a very good place right now. He's confident. He's really bought into trying to become the best player he can be on both ends of the floor.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,One example of that is end of games. He does not want to be taken out because of the perceived lack of a defensive player.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Every time this season when he has been taken out, he gives Ryan Saunders a death glare -- like, I can't believe you're taking me out. He's closed a lot of games for us lately because he's 6-10, he's defending well and he's rebounding at a high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's confident, he's aggressive and he's had a huge impact on this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it's interesting, when I go back to that trade deadline, I think we were in Tampa playing the Raptors. As is always the case, to get a player, an impact player, you have to give something up. Gary Harris was a huge part of our team. Gary Harris was here when I got here and was a big part of us kind of building our team into what it is today."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"To give up a guy like Gary Harris, as well as R.J. Hampton, who was a rookie, that was hard. The lead-up, we're driving to the airport. We spent the night after the game. We're driving to the airport. It's the day of the trade deadline, and Gary is on the bus with us. I get a call, and as we're approaching the plane, the trade is done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"In a weird way, maybe it was great it happened this way because a lot of guys were crying, and we all had a chance to give Gary a hug and let him know how much we loved him and appreciated him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"So that was hard. That's something that is never really talked about when trades are made. You always talk about the player you're getting. Just like trading a guy like Monte and Will for KCP, man, those guys were here for a long time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Second part of your question, it was evident pretty quickly, to your point, but the game that stands out right after that trade deadline was our game in L.A. beating the Clippers. They were healthy, we were healthy and we beat them, and Aaron's impact was noticeable because of his ability to guard a guy like Kawhi Leonard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know after that game, I felt we had a real chance to win a championship that year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then unfortunately as we all know, soon thereafter, Jamal suffered the ACL injury, which kind of put things out of whack for a while. So Aaron has been tremendous for us. You look at the job he's done against Karl-Anthony Towns, against guys like Kevin Durant, LeBron James and whoever we have next round he'll play just as important a role for us, so very grateful that Aaron is here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's been difficult for us as far as how long we have to wait to play, just being anxious and being ready. That's the most difficult part. We're just trying to stay focused with it for this long time period that we have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Lucky for us, we get a couple more days of rest. But we're enjoying this time, fixing all our injuries, getting back, getting ready to 100 percent, everybody, and just trying to stay focused. Everybody just reminding each other what's at stake."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I'm going to tell them what I see fit. I don't know. I haven't been -- my time I had in the 2020 NBA Finals wasn't this. I didn't have a long period of time to rest.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But just talking, having conversation, just reminding everybody on the goal that we have. Just trying to just tell them to keep -- reminding them to stay locked in, no matter how you do it, just try to do it the best that you can."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"But I think as a team, I think we've done a great job of that as far as coming in, getting our work in, off days, just staying on treatment and just being ready."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It says a lot, just being professional, making it work for himself and the team. It's just being a professional and just adjusting to your teammates and the organization."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I feel like we've been here a long period of time working out. I feel like it does affect us just because I've felt it out there before playing. But like I said, the advantage is them having to come in and adjust to the altitude, which we've been here for a while now doing that, working out, getting our breathing right, lungs, everything. It's going to be an advantage for us, I would say."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"No. I mean, Mike is a great coach. Been doing it for a while. I had his dad in Detroit as an assistant coach, so I've been knowing both of them for a long time. He's just very professional about his job. He wants to get it done no matter what."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It was. For me, it was a breath of fresh air. I got a chance to compete for a championship again. Just knowing this team from playing them, I knew what we had and what I was coming into. I fit well, I would say."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,It made it so easy for me when I did get traded. It made it so easy for me to adjust and just be comfortable within myself and my game.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I don't remember the conversation between us, but every time I see him, though, I do thank him. We do talk and just -- I'm happy I'm here and being in the position to win another championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"They've both got a lot of fight in them. They're not going to back down and give up games easy. That's pretty much all I can see right now as far as like watching the game. Both teams are tough. But when we do our thing, we cover both teams because we don't know who it's going to be. We're just hoping -- we're just waiting right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It is. We make it fun. I feel like on any team you can make it fun when everybody is sharing the ball. But here, everybody shares the ball. Everybody wants to help each other out, no matter what it is. That just makes your confidence go high when you've got your teammates behind you all the way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"First of all, we have more veterans over here. Secondly, they're all vocal. Everybody talks, no matter who it is. Even me, they come up and talk to me, give me advice on what I should do or ask me what I think about this. I love feeding off them guys like Ish, DJ, Jeff. We talk a lot about just basketball. They've just helped me out to be the leader that I am, vocal, and just being able to get my teammates in position and just letting them know, all right, we can do this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, I don't think there's a difference. My 2020 championship, I had great Laker fans. Here I have even greater fans. I just love being able to put on for my fans. It gives a great feeling and a confidence just knowing the screaming and the support behind you is also greater."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I heard the rumor. I didn't know how true it was until the next morning when I woke up and got on the phone with my agent. They said it could be possible but wasn't sure yet. But my agent did his job. He made it happen. I'm happy.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm always talking about it. For me, just to be a part of history with the Denver Nuggets, making their first Finals appearance, winning their first NBA championship, I feel like I'm more excited about that than anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"No, to be honest, when we win, the win was nice, and like about half an hour after that, we were just, okay, it's a win. It was not -- to be honest it, was not some -- I thought it was going to be much bigger feeling to be honest."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,And I didn't celebrate or whatever. I was just enjoying relaxing.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"He give me the ball a little bit more basketball-wise. But like this, not much. I think he still have passion. He's still into it. Still -- you know, basketball-wise, he's giving me the ball more but like a person, I think he didn't change a lot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, I think he deserve especially because he averaged a lot. He averaged 30 points, a great percentage in the last series. I think that's really hard to do, especially that high number of points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But not just points. I think his energy, I would say even from the first round, his energy, he's been our best player since round one, and he's really stepping up and in that reaction, like being in. Even if he doesn't make shots, this, that, but his energy is always good. I think that's the best feeling for the guys around him. You know, yes, we know he can make shots, he can go for 50. But even when things doesn't go his way, he doesn't fall down. He is still playing. He's still fighting. I think that's the best thing about him right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, to be honest, you cannot control what people are going to talk about you are not going to talk about you, so I'm not even going to comment of, you know, he deserve or not."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think he deserve it, but who am I."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"My first couple of years, I had really good chemistry with Gary Harris, if you guys remember. We had a really nice two-man game that we have. Then kind of slow build-up to Jamal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But he always had a fight in his eye. He always had that something that -- he was, I don't want to say chasing something, where he always has to be better, be more. He always wanted to be something bigger than he was in that moment. I think if I remember him -- if I have one thing that I remember him in my rookie year, it was that. He was always hungry for more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yeah, he was there. He won a championship. But the best thing about KCP, he knows exactly where to be, and I think that's the best. He's doing that in first game, seventh game, playoff game, Finals game, whatever, pregame. He always do what he supposed to do, and I think that's the best way to describe him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's not seven. It's basically my whole life, except wife, who is 10 years with me. But always my family, my mom and dad was always supporting, my dad especially. He always thought that I could be something more -- like Jamal wanted to be something more."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Then when I go to the other city, and kind of my older brother took that role and kind of he lived with me, and then we came to the United States, and then my brother, Nemanja, who lives here before, seven years I think or nine years, it's like 15 years, we get together, and it's just a nice journey."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"To be honest, when I was coming to United States, I was happy that I'm going to be with them. When you're a kid and you're small, when you were little, you always want to be around with the big brothers, and that was -- I was not going to say I was more happy. I was more happy to be around them than being in NBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"No. That cannot help you. But the thing that I knew that even before that the basketball is not main thing in my life, and probably never going to be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"And to be honest, I look at it because I have something more at home that is more important than basketball. I think that's maybe that I'm going to -- I learned this. I knew that but this kind of proved me that I'm correct."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, yes. Especially when you get bad days, good days. When you go home, it's always normal, and I think that's the best thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"At that time, I didn't know. At that time, I never thought I'm going to be in NBA. But seemed like it was all connected and we all get together in USA, so it was a good thing for us. Maybe that was a sign that it's a good thing because my wife, at that time girlfriend, she was going in Oklahoma in college, and we were separate for six, seven, eight months, I don't remember."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But we were young and it was kind of nice period, nice to get together in that age, 20, 21. But I never thought I'm going to be in NBA. Maybe that was a good sign that my family -- that my family -- I didn't know that there was going to be my wife -- my girlfriend, I didn't know that's going to be my wife, get together and live from day one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't know. That's a good question. You know, I thought we going to do some -- I thought I'm going to have in myself, I'm going to have a bigger -- I'm going to have bigger emotions, yes, we won the game and I was really happy, yes, yes, we made history, this, that. But at the end of the day, next year, nobody is going to remember us or two years from now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"So maybe if we win it all, maybe it's going to be different but we will see."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, still isn't, but yeah, that's true. Felipe was the first guy who told me I was going to be an MVP. It was a car drive to the airport, I remember him, I was laughing. He is the guy who first mention to me in conversation or whatever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But I never thought that I'm going to come here, but to be honest I'm playing the same way since my days in Sombor, I think, so I didn't change. Maybe I upgrade a little bit, but I didn't trade my style or play since day one, and it's working. So maybe the consistency is the key."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't watch Game 5, so I don't know. I was walking with my daughter -- I'm lying. I watched the first quarter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Today, I don't know what we're going to do but I think we're going to -- family, I think, maybe somebody is going to watch together, but I'm going to watch with family, or not."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Maybe I'm not. Maybe that's just talk around me. I don't know, I think probably my family, my close friends, my family, you need to ask them. I think I didn't change because I still have the same friends, same family, same spot that I'm going, same things that I'm doing. But maybe you need to ask my friends and my family. But they are not going to answer you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, there is no answer, probably."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, just keeping things tight. You know, everybody coming out, getting their work in, staying in their routine because you know we have so much time off."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like you said, we don't know who to prepare for, but we are going to be ready for both, and just staying tight, getting shots up and making sure you're healthy, making sure you're in the gym, not staying out of the gym. So just keeping everything tight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, obviously this is what every player wants to do is compete at the highest level, and you know, winning is obviously more fun for everybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So just going from the situation in Kansas and winning a lot, and then winning my last year and then coming straight here and getting into the situation that, one, is a good fit, and two, then we get to win right away. I couldn't imagine a better spot to be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"And just the people around you, obviously I enjoy them and just this team, and so yeah, I'm blessed to have two years in a row playing at the highest level and winning at the highest level, and it's different. In the NCAA Tournament, it's one game. So, there's a lot of pressure on that one game, and here there's a lot of ups and downs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, we have had series where we win two and we think we are up 2-0, it's a big lead, and then you go lose two on the road. It's completely different. But the same pressure, the same fun atmosphere, fun environment and the fans at both levels have been great. So, just blessed to have that opportunity to win at the highest level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, they don't ask too much of me. Obviously, I mean, they get that from what we did in college as a team. And then just having that on your resume coming into this, they know that I wasn't coming in here trying to, you know, do too much or play outside of my role or play outside of myself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They allowed me to be me, and I said that all year. Like Coach has allowed me to do what I do. My teammates, all the players have allowed me to be me, and it's just made the transition so much easier. I don't have to come in and try to do anything I'm not good at, and just thrive in the role that they put me in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think earlier they saw that when I was put in that position, I didn't try to do too much, and I just wanted to win. I wanted to make winning plays, and those energy effort plays. And I think that this team is a team when I got here that was like super talented, like the most talented team in the NBA probably, and we just needed pieces. We didn't need anybody to come in off the bench and try to do too much, try to shoot too much."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"We just needed pieces that complement what we already have, and I think they saw that I was willing to do that, willing to play defense, and then obviously they taught me a lot over the course of the year. So I think that's probably how I earned their trust."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"No, I don't think so at all. I think that I did similar things in college. Obviously, I scored more in the role, but it was similar my freshman year. I didn't have that same scoring role."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So you build those things up over time and this is really similar to -- I was on a good team my freshman year and I was more a piece to a really good team, and just making energy and effort plays in the time that I get, whether it's two minutes, five minutes, twenty minutes, just try to make an impact and make an impact on the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"The biggest thing I learned. I think the biggest takeaway from the Conference Finals itself, for me, like I just said was like whether you get two minutes or you get 20 minutes, you have to make an impact in those minutes, and there was times definitely I could have been better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, looking back on that, I have to be able to build on that and learn from different mistakes. You know you're going to make mistakes but the leash gets shorter in the playoffs. We are winning. We swept in the Conference Finals. So, there's nothing to be upset about or anything like that. You've just got to learn from it. You have two minutes, and then you have to make an impact in those two minutes and the team has to be better when you're on the court. So that's probably what I learned the most."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Man, there's a lot. I think that everybody kind of talks about his routine. You know, he comes in and does the same exact routine every single day, the same shots, the same step-backs, the same fadeaways, the same free throw routine. He doesn't take any shortcuts. He's here early. He's here getting treatment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, his routine, his consistency with what he does is obviously the most impressive part, and I think that's why you see -- and he makes comments like that all the time. Like it's just no different than what he does every day. Like those shots that he hits, all the fadeaways, all the one-legged-behind-his-head shots that he's hitting, like he shoots these things every day. So, he's not surprised when they go in, and I think that consistency is what everybody wants to take away from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Well, I don't know about that exact shot, but I mean he hit one at home that was the exact same shot. Just I think it was on the other side."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think he was shooting like a really good percentage on those fadeaways, like the last-second shot we beat Orlando early in the year on a step-back, similar shot. So, when the clock is going down, that's what he's good at, and he shoots the same exact shot every single time, and it goes in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,So just the consistency in what he does every day. Nobody is surprised when he hits them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I mean, obviously he knows the game better than anybody I've ever been around obviously and I think that everybody would say the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, him and Coach see eye-to-eye on a lot of things and they are on the same page, and that's probably built up over however many years they have been together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So him, Jamal and Coach are on the same page. A lot of plays they draw up, I know Coach said in one of his postgame interviews that Nikola came over and took the board and we ran like the same five plays that him and Jamal drew up every time and scored on it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So just the knowledge that he brings, and he's not a guy that wants to take over in the huddle. He listens to Coach and does what Coach wants him to, and when he sees things, he points them out and that goes for anybody on the team. I think Jamal sees things, he points them out, and everybody is on the same page. And that's just trust built up over, you know, however many years they have been together."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I've got good teammates. I've had really good coaches. Obviously, I went to Kansas, Coach Self was great. Come here and another great coach with Coach Malone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like I said, every system I've went into, whether it was AAU or it was up to the NBA, every system I've went into was a winning culture and was a team that demanded certain things of you."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, I'm not going to sit here and say it was me coming in and changing anything. It was me coming in and adapting to what was already set up before I got there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, KU had a culture set up when I got there, and I was just really easily able to adapt to that, and I think I would say the same thing for here."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Like when I got drafted, I knew, hey, this team is the most talented team in the NBA, especially that starting five, and obviously we had Bruce who has been important as anybody."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's no secret thing but just joining a culture and being able to adapt is how you get on the court doing that, and I think that's what I've been good at is adapting."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think the trust that they have built up, like I said before I got here, and then adding pieces like Bruce and like me and guys that come in that are low maintenance. They listen to Coach and they trust what he's telling us. We come in and we drill the same fundamental things in practice all the time. Teams that struggle, they get old with those things, and Coach says all the time, I think he said the other day, ""Don't get bored with success."""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think we have came in and we have drilled the fundamentals and listened to Coach and nobody tries to push back on what he says. It's a good balance between Coach listening to the players, like we said with Nikola, and us listening to Coach."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I think everyone is on the same page, and we have a lot of guys in that exact moment in their career, they want to win and this is their time to win, and I think that we had all the right pieces come together. And we are here. We have not done anything yet. Job is not even close to finished. We want to watch who wins this game and then finish the job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"He's been great, ever since Draft night. Like when he drafted me and he told me exactly what he needed from me and what he wanted to see from me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"You know, he doesn't chime in too much. Kind of lets me be me. That's another part of this whole organization, letting me be who I am, and I think ever since Draft night, he's told me what I wanted. He knew that I fit well with this team. Thought I was a perfect fit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So, we've been on the same page with that, and like you said, I'm his first draft pick. So it's my job to do what I'm supposed to do and come in and contribute. I think I've done that for the most part. Like I said we are four games away from doing what we want to do. I don't think anybody in the locker room feels like we've accomplished what we want to accomplish yet."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So Mr. Booth has been a big part of my first year, and he just chimes in when he sees different things, but it's my job to make him look good, obviously."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"They are similar for sure. Kind of like old school way teach things, the way they go about things. I like that. I think that's the coaching style I prefer. They will both tell you when you're wrong, but they will also tell you when you're doing things right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So they are tough on you. They are funny. They like to joke around. They keep things light-hearted, but they really want to win. Those are two of the most competitive people I've been around since I started playing basketball."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Coach Self, that's all he's about and all he's done, and Coach Malone is the same way. You guys see Coach Malone get so frustrated because he wants to win so bad and that goes for everybody on the team. Everybody on the team is at the point of their career where we want to win. Like I always want to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"But just coming off that championship, and having a chance to get another one, we are all in the same place and I think there's similarities with everybody's mindset. So Coach Self and him are similar but I think everybody is similar and like our competitiveness with this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, I think there's a lot of differences. Like I said just with how the games are set up, and college is one-game elimination and this is obviously a series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"So there's a lot of differences. This you, you have to be more keyed in on personnel and with players' tendencies. In college, you're more set on sets and things like that. There's a lot of differences, but I think just being ready to win and we have guys that do what it takes to put ourselves in that position, and we've got talented guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"There's definitely some similarities and differences, but it's all the same thing. Every time you go out there, we are just trying to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"No, I think I'm pretty much right where I'm supposed to be. I got drafted to a perfect fit and this is where we all expected to be. I think I said this multiple times."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"I told all my people this, when we won the Western Conference Finals, it felt good, but I mean, it didn't feel like -- we still haven't done what we wanted to do. Like I don't feel like I've accomplished the goal, and I want these next four games worse than anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"This is kind of where I expected to be it the team I'm on and everybody in the locker room is on the same page with what they want and winning. So I think I'm right where I need to be, especially for this year, and obviously there's a lot of growth, and like I just said, I learned a lot from, especially last series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 27,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"But there's a lot of growth that I need to make, and right now, we are focused on winning and then in the offseason we'll focus on other individual things. But I think I'm right where I need to be and just want to get these four games really bad."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was good. Everybody on the flight was standing up, it wasn't just the players, so it was nice to have the staff, just mingling, all that, which was cool. Obviously, everybody was just enjoying the moment, like you said. It was a good flight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Just our awareness, especially we need to lock in on practices for just the detail stuff, man. Let's be on time, let's not have any turnovers that we're doing scripts, just kind the simple things so we're not getting sloppy just because we are where we are. I think it's more of those mental awareness days instead of -- we know our bodies are going to be right by that time, June 1, so just making sure our mental is staying sharp and locked in throughout these days."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think he's done amazing, not just with his scoring or his shooting but with the all-around game. He's grabbing boards, he's helping out on the boards, grabbing like 10 a game, and playing defense, just communicating more, doing all the little things that will help us be more in tune on both ends of the court, staying spaced, not cutting when it's not there. Picking his spots when to shoot it, pass it, cut. Just everything. Just playing a more complete game throughout the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"That's the thing, we take the rest, yeah, but you don't want to pick up bad habits throughout this week. Like I said to Mike, just staying sharp, whatever it is. If we've got to flip the switch and lock in for a drill or two, let me do that. Just be able to stay locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,We don't want to get relaxed. I think that's the biggest thing. We don't want to relax and just wait. We want to stay sharp.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Well, on the defensive end I'd say it's our intent. I was watching the hockey game yesterday, just threw it on, and they said one team is playing -- I think it was the green team and the white team. Couldn't tell you. But one team was -- they said one team was playing with a certain intent, a certain intensity, a meaning, whether they turn it over or not, whether they missed a shot or not, they play with a certain aggression and awareness and the other team was just kind of going through the motions, and you could visibly see it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think our defense has been being played with intent. I think we've all been on a string. When we need a stop, we all lock in, even if we don't get it, we lock in and try and get it possession by possession. I think that's crucial at this stage."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"They've been great. I think the biggest thing for them is just staying ready. I think during the season, P-Wat Peyton Watson came in against Phoenix and another team I think he played where he played really well. Just being aggressive, not overthinking. CB Christian Braun has been great all year, just picking his spots and being solid while he's on the court. And everybody else, man, just staying ready and staying within the group upstairs."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"If we do two groups, everybody is either making a sub, subbing themselves in, or just knowing what's going on. I think that's crucial."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"So right now we're very team oriented. We've got everybody participating, everybody involved, and everybody mentally, like I said, locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"I think we've seen everything. I was going to make a joke, but no, that's okay, because it'll be everywhere."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just think we've seen everything. We've seen all the adjustments. We've seen the double from the baseline, the double from the top, the sign from a non-shooter to single coverage to -- know what I'm saying? We've seen every different type of mixture. We've seen them try to put Kawhi and PG to switch it, we've seen everything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,It's all a read. It's all balance. It's all timing. I don't think that worked.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just think because we've envisioned it since the beginning, like just me personally, me and him have envisioned it and dreamt about it and went through all these moments in our head and on the court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's been saying, how often do you get this opportunity to be in this position and living your dream basically, living it up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,Just taking advantage of the opportunity and realizing what the opportunity is I think is the biggest thing. So just having fun right now.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I don't know. I've been playing basketball a lot lately."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, that's why it's nice playing with this team because everything is a read. If somebody is open, you're going to see that on film that that guy is open, and everybody is playing for each other. If I cut, it's for the other guy to get an open shot. If I run my lane, it's for everybody else to get their own shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"So, I think when we're just playing the right way, everything opens up for everybody. Could be a Bruce three, could be a Mike back-door cut, could be AG that's just standing in the dunker waiting. I think everybody eats when we're all playing for each other, and we've been doing that for a while now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,I think we're just in a great rhythm of playing unselfish basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, like I said, we came off the bench together my rookie year when I was backing up Gary Harris, and he was backing up Nurk Jusuf Nurkic. So, we would actually come into the game together, and we would run post-ups or just simple give-and-goes, but we used to run it crazy, run it really good, and he used to make a lot of over-the-head passes, and I'd say then we kind of developed a chemistry."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Soon we both started, we started playing off each other. We started to figure out where we like the ball, when we liked the ball, when I'm going to pass, when he's going to pass, when he's driving, when to relocate, where to relocate. It was just all the details we picked up together over time playing for most of our careers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, not just me but everybody. I just think he puts everybody in the right spots. When it's time to lock in, he can lock you in. He doesn't -- he's funny. He goofs around a lot, yeah, but when we're messing up -- you know like you know when you're messing up but you're getting away with it? Yeah, he'll get on you, and I think I respect that a lot just because we're all in it together. It's not like it's malicious or anything, it's just we all have a goal here. We're all here for a reason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's nice. We've been putting -- I go to him for a lot of the offensive stuff, just reads and what he's seeing just because I know he's locked in on that, and sometimes Coach may be thinking about subs or lineups or time and score, whatever, but he's always given me great input on what we can run or sometimes we have the same ideas, which is just really nice to see that what I am feeling in the game he's also seeing from afar."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"Well deserved, and he should definitely be getting more offers."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"I mean, you can only play one game at a time, but we know we've got four to go, four wins to go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"To answer your first question, no, we haven't sat down and talked about it or anything like that. Like I said, we talk the language on the court when we're playing. We just read the game and play off each other. There's no -- it's hard to explain. There's no selfishness when we're playing the game. It's just hit, cut, pass, move. If it's not there, you don't throw it. I try to go one-on-one, doesn't have it, hit, cut. We're just kind of free flowing, playing the game, and it has been working."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"It's nice. Especially coming off the injuries, to be here. It just feels good. Like I said, I want to win these four before we indulge in any celebrations or anything like that. Just trying to stay locked in. Yeah, just stay locked in and enjoy the moment, but we know we've got more work to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, we're just trying to win a championship. All that comes after you win the championship. If we were to lose, no one gets that trophy, right? We win the championship, everybody eats. I'm just excited to see everybody succeed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I didn't see anything. I didn't hear anything."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, I remember everything. I was sitting there with my coaches. It felt like it took forever to take off, and the front of the plane had some music playing, sounded pretty lively. But the back of the plane was -- I was nervous to go back there. They said, Coach, you don't want to go in the back, so I stayed away from the back and kept my head down. Watched part of the fourth quarter, all the plays that we made down the stretch, which was just incredible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,Have we come up with a name for Nikola's shot? Is there going to be like a historical name for the shot he made? A Sombor Sling. All right.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"It was eventful. But for me, it was just trying to soak in the whole moment, and kept on asking myself, Is the series really over? Let everybody else have some fun, but we've got a lot of work to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it's impossible to keep your rhythm if you're not playing games. You can do whatever you want in practice, but there's no way you can replicate playing an NBA playoff game. We gave our guys off Tuesday. Wednesday was an option day. A lot of guys showed up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then just yesterday had everybody come in, get some conditioning in, PD, and today we got a good practice. Didn't go long. But for us, my biggest concern is the rhythm, as you mentioned, but more importantly conditioning. You're playing every other day, every other day for so long, and now all of a sudden you have an eight-, nine-, 10-day break, whatever it is. I wanted to make sure we got up and down, conditioned."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"The energy in the gym was great. It's a tough situation because you're just kind of preparing for an opponent you don't know who you're going to play. So right now as I told our players, this is about us. We have to shore up who we are and address the areas that we have not been maybe good enough or areas that we can clean up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's really hard to keep your rhythm when you're not playing NBA games, but we'll do everything we can to try to keep the rhythm as best as possible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, I think for eight years now, I think it's kind of been a part of our culture. In this business, you have to bring in talented players that's a given. But I think we've always done a good job of identifying guys that will fit into this culture."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, it's a delicate balance because I think in life, not just in sports but in life, you have to enjoy moments. I think if you don't enjoy the small victories and the moments along the way, I think you're missing something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"At the same time, we have much work in front of us. Our goal wasn't just to win the Western Conference championship. It wasn't just to get to the NBA Finals. Our goal was to win a championship, and obviously that's in front of us still."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"So you enjoy the moment and you enjoy the people you're working with and go to war with every night, but at the same time, I think it's my job to remind our guys that don't read and listen to everybody telling you how great you are because then you're going to get a little soft with success, and I don't want us getting soft with success. I want us staying hungry. I want us staying desperate and urgent and disciplined."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"That's our biggest challenge right now, because we don't even know who we're playing. That's going to be our biggest challenge as we approach next Thursday night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, obviously that last four seconds was an eternity. I took that technical foul in that second quarter on purpose because it was -- which is most of the time when I get a tech, it's on purpose."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"As I told one of the officials at the end of the first half, I said -- I let him know I did that on purpose, and this is why. I just felt it was getting out of hand."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then you allude to the last play of the game where they get LeBron the ball in the high post. He drives to his left hand, Aaron Gordon on his hip and Jamal Murray in front of him. Puts his hands in there, makes a great defensive play, correct no-call. But we always know in those situations, a great player a lot of times will get those calls."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Kudos to the referees for realizing it was what it was. I think all of us were somewhat stunned when the buzzer went off, there was no whistle, holy s---, we won. I think I speak for a lot of people. So that was amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Nikola's shot, I mean, that's what I wanted to watch because just all the key plays down the stretch, things that -- Nikola's drive, which wound up being the winning basket of the game, just guys stepping up with a potential sweep on the line."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"You and I talked about this, Kis. You reminded me of the history this franchise has had with the Lakers, and it hasn't been a history that Nuggets fans are proud of. So to do it against that team in that building made it even that much more special because of the guys like Dan Issel, Doug Moe, just the great players, great people that have represented this franchise for so many years. So this was for them, as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the moment, it's us, our coaching staff, our players. But this was for all Nuggets. That was what was really cool about it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"No, we're just going to show up for Game 1."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I mean, each round we have one coach dedicated to the opponent. So right now obviously we have two coaches, one working on Boston, one working on Miami. We have been talking about both teams every day. Obviously watched the game last night, and we'll watch again tomorrow night to see if Miami can close it out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"If you talk about Miami first and you look at what they've done this postseason, being in the Play-In, upsetting Milwaukee 4-1 in the first round, beating New York in the second round and jumping out to a 3-0 lead over Boston in the Eastern Conference Finals. Erik Spoelstra is a hell of a coach. Won a championship. He's been there forever. Jimmy Butler has been played at an extremely high level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But when I look at Miami, I kind of see a lot of similarities between Miami and us. People talk about Jimmy, and Bam was an All-Star, but to me they have guys stepping up every night."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Gabe Vincent has been phenomenal. Him being out last night was a big advantage for Boston because Gabe Vincent has been playing so well. Caleb Martin has been playing so well. Kyle Lowry has had a great postseason. Kevin Love, Duncan Robinson. Tyler Herro may come back."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that that game is going to be -- if it's Miami, that series will be hard-fought, very good defensive team and with a guy in Jimmy Butler that has shown that, kind of like Nikola and Jamal, the biggest stage, he takes advantage of the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then obviously in Boston you have a team that was in the NBA Finals last year. We know what they're capable of on both ends of the floor. Jayson Tatum is one of the best one-on-one players in the game. Jaylen Brown, that two-headed attack that they have. But their other guys, their role players, if you will, the Al Horfords, the Marcus Smarts, the Derrick Whites, the Malcolm Brogdons, those guys, Robert Williams."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"You don't get to the Finals with just one player. I think ourselves and, whether it's Boston or Miami, have complete teams and have quality depth."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"No matter who it is, we know that we'll have our hands full trying to bring home the first championship in franchise history."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"That he's never changed. I think we all see it in all walks of life. How does fame, fortune affect you, and for most people, it goes to their head and they become something different. Sometimes they forget where they've come from and who helped them get to where they've gotten to. And the one thing I really love about Nikola, just forget basketball, to your point, just as a young man who is a proud father and a husband, as you mentioned, but through all the success, the MVPs, the max contracts, all that stuff, he's still the same guy. I marvel at that because I've been in the league and around this game a long time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"That is a rarity in this business. And for a celebrity, a superstar in general. The fact that Nikola is still a humble, selfless person and he cares about home, he cares about family, he cares about his horses -- like the guy is just who he is. I couldn't have more respect for him as a man because of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,Interesting question. You have to find ways to improve from series to series and round to round to try to advance. But every round and every opponent is a completely different problem and challenge.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,Every team is built differently.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"You think about the first round with guys like Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards, you think about the second round with two unstoppable players in Devin Booker and Kevin Durant and you think about LeBron and AD. I think overall our defense has really passed that test to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Then you think about our offense, we played the Lakers, who had the No. 1 defense in the Playoffs, and our offensive rating after four games was 122.3, which is historical. So that speaks to how potent the offense is. When you combine a capable defense with that offense, that allows you to do great things. That's what we've been able to do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I see just kind of a real consistency from our group, from Game 1 against Minnesota through Game 4 against the Lakers. That's what you want at this time of year."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, if anybody is still talking about the Lakers in the NBA Finals, that's on them. They've gone fishing. We're still playing. The narrative should be on whatever two teams are still alive, because to get to that point is historical in nature for us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's the first time in franchise history the Denver Nuggets have made the NBA Finals. We're not satisfied with that, but I just hope that the narrative is on the two teams that are representing their conferences. Let's salute and appreciate the greatness of every one of those players on the court. Let's appreciate the journey each of them has made to get to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"We have guys, it'll be their first time in the Finals. We have guys in KCP that have won a championship before. That should be the narrative. Let's get all the negativity out of the way, because this is a tremendous accomplishment. I hope that they're celebrated for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Oh, it'll be a hell of a challenge. To your point, if you look at Jimmy Butler's body of work and what he's been doing since that first round against Milwaukee, upsetting the No. 1 seed four games to one. Milwaukee has got some really good defensive players. I think I heard Jrue Holiday say the other day it didn't matter who was guarding Jimmy in that series, he was in a zone and he was unstoppable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"You don't stop a guy like Jimmy Butler with one player. It's not going to be just on Aaron Gordon. It won't be just on Michael Porter or whoever is guarding him. You have to guard guys like that, and you mentioned them, the KDs, the Anthony Edwardses, the Devin Bookers, the LeBron Jameses. That is five guys defending as one to try to stop a player with that kind of talent. That's going to be the same mindset if it is Miami trying to stop Jimmy Butler. You have to give him different looks and you have to keep him off balance and you have to have five guys locked into that task one possession at a time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, no, I can't go home and be in like Game 7 mindset because my wife and kids would leave me. I have to force myself to take a deep breath and remind myself that I am a husband, I am a father and to be a part of my family. My family keeps me balanced. My family keeps me grounded. I think that's so important at this time of the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"We spend a tremendous amount of time preparing our players, preparing ourselves and getting ready for each and every game. But I think you also have to take time to enjoy the moment and be a regular person. If that means me going home today and beating my wife in pickleball, so be it. But I have to make sure that I'm taking a deep breath once in a while and enjoying the view while also maintaining an eye and a perspective on what we have in front of us. That's our attitude as a team right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know what, I've never heard that question before, and I think it's a great one because I've never even thought about that. It's funny how different players use maybe a perceived slight -- I was drafted, I was traded -- they use it as motivation to carry them forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the eight years I've been with Nikola, and I spend a lot of time with him not just during the season but in the offseason, off the court, I've never felt him have any kind of perceived slight about being drafted 41."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think for him it's been more about somebody took a chance on me, even though I guess he was drafted during a Taco Bell commercial. Maybe that was what pushed him forward, was it didn't even have his pick on the draft."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"Early on, being the best player he could be was not necessarily about a skill set. It was about maturing, growing up, handling adversity, dealing with the referees, getting into the best shape of his life, losing weight. I think once that all happened, that kind of coincided with our rise to where we've been the last five seasons now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I can't speak for Nikola, but I've never felt that being picked 41st in the second round has been his motivating factor for him to be a two-time MVP and to be a guy that is averaging a triple-double in the Playoffs. I think what really motivates him is no more individual accolades and awards he wants to be a world champion. I think that's what motivates Nikola Jokic as well as everybody else in this building."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, I mean, everybody was super happy. Everybody was just having a good time. I was all throughout the plane, talking to everyone through the front and the back. Then I got a little tired, so I went to sleep."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,But high spirits on the plane. We're happy we're in the Finals.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Pretty relaxed days, recovering and getting ready for the Finals. Today was kind of our first practice. Last few days were PD days, so today was our first practice."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I mean, honestly, either. I don't care. We're going to prepare the same, whoever wins. But that's a great series right now. I can't wait to find out who we play."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"For me, it's not difficult at all. I've watched every game. Right now, really just recovering, resting. And then our days off have me some time to go out and golf. It's been great."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, the first day of golf I played pretty well. The second day was terrible."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, this is just a great locker room. Make everything easy, make coming to work easy. Like today was a serious practice, but everybody was having a good time laughing, smiling. So it's just a great group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I don't know. Different people deal with different situations different. You could talk to Mike different than you talk to Jack or Jack talk to me. Just knowing that, you just know how to approach your teammates and how to come off correct to them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"But me and KCP, you can come at me any way. You can spaz on me, you can come nice. I'm going to take it the same way. If that helped this group, for both of us, then I think we did a pretty good job."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, I haven't thought about it too much. I think I'll think about it when we're done. But obviously it's been a great season, been a great decision to come here and play with these guys. It's been a perfect fit. I'm happy I chose here. Coach actually asked me what my contract was like for next year. But I haven't thought about the future, other than the Finals, yet."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, you dream about being in situations like this. I never really used to watch the Finals. The only time I did watch it is when I was growing up and was a Celtics fan and they were there. But now approaching it, it's crazy. My phone has been blowing up ever since the sweep."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I can't wait for it to get started.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Maybe a little bit, but it's a whole different year. The Celtics have a different coach. But I played them last year, so I kind of know -- I played the Celtics a lot the last few years, so kind of know some of their players."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,But maybe. We'll see.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I really haven't thought about free agency at all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Oh, last year? Yeah, it was just fit, and then they basically said what I wanted to hear because I wanted to get out of that 4 man, big-man role, floater game, and show what I can do. The first time they said you can come here and be a guard because Jamal was coming off injury and Mike was coming off injury, and that's exactly what I wanted to hear. So that was a perfect fit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I would say just vibes in the locker room after practice. Usually the last few teams I've been on, practice is over, everyone showers and everyone gets out. But here I sit in my locker for like 30, 40 minutes like it's college, just joking, laughing and having a good time with the fellas. Some of them leave early because they have families, obviously, but when they don't have to go home right away we just sit in the locker room cracking jokes and having a good time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, he's just the ultimate leader, ultimate professional, comes in every day, works extremely hard and holds everyone accountable. But he is the only one on this team who has won a championship. He knows what it takes and what we need to do. We've got to listen to that guy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, definitely. As I said, me growing up a Celtics fan, watching the NBA Finals when they were there, it would be insane. Like I said, when they had me mic'd up, the Playoffs in L.A., I'm watching the Celtics play L.A. in the Finals, and obviously this last round we played the Lakers. It would be great. I'd be in front of my family, my people back where I went to high school."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"But if we did go back to Boston, there would be a lot of tickets, so it would be really expensive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I think coming into the year, we always knew we had a chance to be here, and we've proved it all year. There's been ups and downs, for sure, but the biggest thing we improved on was defense. Early in the year it was nonexistent kind of, or some games it was there and some games it wasn't. But on the defensive end, we got a lot better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,Not that I could remember now. But yeah.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Obviously just being a guard. I didn't show that I could be a guard in Brooklyn, but here I'm majority playing backup 1, you could say. In the biggest minutes of the game I'm on the floor, contributing on both ends of the floor. I think the biggest question was can I score outside of being with those two great players I played with last year, and I've proven that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, so the rumors coming into free agency last year was I was getting a lot offers, which I wasn't. Nobody really wanted me because they didn't know if I could be a guard or not. I kind of took it personal. But I knew after the season, the way I played in Brooklyn, it wouldn't fit or people would question how I played."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"So I kind of told my agent that I was going to get F'd this summer. I already knew it. So I just came in with a chip on my shoulder. Denver came in and said the right things, and it clicked. It was a perfect fit."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"I think it was very easy. I think right away it clicked maybe. I just think I had to be more aggressive. I was kind of passive toward the beginning of the year, trying to pick my spots. But my teammates told me to be aggressive, be me, nobody can guard me out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,So I think it was an easy fit to move to backup point guard.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"Yeah, that would definitely be cool. Would probably practice at the U, be around Coach L and all those guys down there, and I could finally congratulate them for making it to the Final Four in person."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,"But I loved my two years at Miami, so it would be great."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"Yeah, on the offensive end, an athletic big guy, someone that is catching lobs and finishing everything around the rim, running the floor. And then obviously on the defensive end, providing that rim protection. Blocking shots, altering shots, protecting the paint and doing all those things. Just doing whatever it takes to win."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"Really excited. Obviously, he's a great point guard. He can make plays and can score and can do a little bit of everything. So I'm really excited for that."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"For sure. It's something I take pride in, the defensive end. Having that opportunity, having that role, is something I'm really looking forward to."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I'm just super excited to get going. Looking forward to being done with this whole chaotic process. I'm just ready to work hard. Super excited."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN WILLIAMS,"First thing I'm going to buy, hopefully somewhere to live, and then probably a dog. I'm kind of looking and trying to get a dog."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN WILLIAMS,"I mean, Shai, and it's kind of ironic that we'll be on the same team now. But I think we have the same type of play style, so I think it'll be cool to compete against him in practice every day."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN WILLIAMS,"I mean, first, try not to ugly cry when you hear your name get called. It's kind of a surreal moment and it's hard to really put into words."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN WILLIAMS,I worked out with them probably a couple weeks ago now. I had a really good workout and the vibes were really good and it was a really competitive environment going forward. So I really enjoyed working out there.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN WILLIAMS,"I think just defensive fire. I think everybody can score the ball. I think just being able to be versatile on defense, as well, and bring that competitive spirit into that gym."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN WILLIAMS,"Oh, absolutely. I think it's a dope experience. He's super talented. It's kind of cool that we get to go through this experience together now instead of being enemies on the court."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,For sure. One thing I'm going to bring is defense. That's what I like to do. That's what they need. I love to defend.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,"The one thing I'm going to work on is my shot. If I can get more consistent in my shot, keep getting my reps up in my free time, just getting a lot of shots up and getting a lot of workouts in. That's what I love to do."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,I worked out with them. Interviewed at Chicago.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,"It was good. I worked out with Malaki Branham, my new teammate. That's good. That's crazy to be his teammate. That workout went good. We competed. I feel like that was the best workout that I ever went against -- Malaki, Dyson, Wendell, Bryce McGowens, Ryan Rollins. We competed and that's what we love to do. Overall, it was a good workout."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,"I fit good. They drafted Josh Primo and they developed him. I feel like the San Antonio Spurs are a big develop team organization, and to be going there is a big blessing."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,The first thing I'll buy with an NBA paycheck is my own car. I never owned my own car. To own my own car is going to be special for me.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,"I look forward to playing against Ja Morant. He's a good player, fast, gets to the basket, athletic. So guard him, it's going to be good."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,"Yeah, for sure. If I got to go down there and they call me to the G League, let's do it. I'm going to get more reps and learn from the other guys that are there. It's all about learning. I love to learn from other people to make me better. So, yeah, G League is good."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BLAKE WESLEY,"Just excited to be here. They may not know me but, I'm a funny guy, outgoing, love the fans. Get along with everybody. So Spurs fans, you're going to love me."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PEYTON WATSON,"First thing I'm going to buy, I ain't really put too much thought into it. I was just really focused on getting drafted first. But probably something like a car or to move my mom wherever I live."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PEYTON WATSON,"And then you said player I want to play against? Most definitely KD. That's my childhood idol growing up, and I can't wait to match up with him."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PEYTON WATSON,"Well, I mean, clearly they know what they are doing. Sam Presti, great GM. I've had some conversations with them and they are really looking forward to putting their stamp on this season and getting some wins. I can't wait to add to that and try to help us win."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PEYTON WATSON,"Yeah, just really getting to know each other, getting to know me as a teammate, as a player. I didn't do a lot of interviews my freshman year, so people want to know my personality and what I'm like in the locker room, as well."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"No, not at all. I actually talked to Houston on the phone when they called and everything. So once they told me I was heading there, I knew it was a trade. I wasn't really too worried about it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"The two other guys they have taken, we played in the same conference in college. So I'm familiar with their games. Me and Jabari played a little bit in high school together in a camp, so I know how he plays as well. I feel like us three are going to jell really good together."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"I know a few guys that are already on the team as of right now. So I feel like I can just go in there and connect with the guys on and off the court and it's going to be an easy transition. Houston is a pretty fun city, so we're going to make sure Toyota Center is full and going to turn up."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"Yeah, so some of the guys that I've known for a minute now, Josh Christopher, Jalen Green, Daishen Nix. I knew actually Josh Christopher and Jalen Green since like the sixth grade, just us playing in California every weekend during AAU. Just seeing their faces and talking to them, I'm really well connected with them. I know them on a personal level. So that's pretty cool."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TYTY WASHINGTON JR,"I mean, every player wants to be a top pick, high pick and stuff like that. As I was falling, I wasn't really stressing about it. It only takes one team to believe in you, and you can go out there and shock the world. That's kind of my mindset on it. I always bet on myself, so I'm just going to go out there with a chip on my shoulder and remember all the teams that skipped me."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JEREMY SOCHAN,"I'm very excited. I think I'll bring a lot of versatility to the team, energy and fight and passion. I'm really excited."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JEREMY SOCHAN,"Right, exactly. I think the Spurs, the best team, they've won the most, and they play as a team. I think that's what I'm about, so yeah."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JEREMY SOCHAN,"I think just all around the person I am, and then on-court stuff I think I just showed that I can be a really good fit for them."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JEREMY SOCHAN,First thing I'm going to buy is a driving license and then a car. I'm looking forward to playing everyone. I can't wait to play every day and just work and compete.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JEREMY SOCHAN,I just want to tell you guys that I'm going to bring energy every day. I'm going to really compete and bring a lot to the table. I can't wait. We're going to have fun.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JEREMY SOCHAN,"It meant a lot. I feel like they were stressing a little bit, too. But I feel like we were very aware of the situation, and what happens, happens. You can't control it. I feel like the vibes were really positive."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JEREMY SOCHAN,Definitely. I think I'm going to fit really well. It's a really young squad. We have a lot of energy. I feel like they were one of the best teams in assists. I really feel like I really fit with that. I feel like it's going to be good.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"First thing I'm going to buy, probably somewhere to live, H Town. So probably that."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"And most looking forward to playing against LeBron. That was my idol growing up, so that's who I'm looking forward to playing against."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"Motivated. Real motivated to get down there, get to work and just meet my teammates, meet my staff, just meet everybody down there. Just building relationships, getting to know the family and just getting to work."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"Definitely added a chip, but God makes no mistakes, so I'm happy to be here. I'm happy to be where I'm wanted. I'm happy to get to Houston and just show them, give them what they picked. Just happy to be here."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"No, everybody in the NBA is similar. Everybody wants to win. Everybody is easy to get along with. I'm just happy to go in there and just meet new people, meet my teammates. And I know they're a young, hungry team just like me, so I'm ready to get in there."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"Most thing I'm looking forward to is just growing with them over these next few years. Growing with them, trying to win games with them, growing with them."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"We're all young, all new to the NBA lifestyle, so just learning from them. They're older than me, so just getting in there and ultimately building that relationship with them so it can transfer to the court."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"It was a night that I'll never forget, seeing the smiles on my family's faces, seeing the smile on my brother's face, seeing the smiles on my family's faces in the crowd. It was just something I'll never forget. Making them proud is something I've worked for all my life."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"My dad just told me it was time to amp it up a little bit, time to work even harder. It's a new level, whole new game. Just trying to get there and get to work."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"Anticipation. Like you're just sitting there, cameras floating around, you don't know where you're going. You get jitters a little bit, you're shaking, you've been working for this all your life."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"You know you just want to hear your name called, and when it happens you get a little relief, emotions settle in. After that, it's just a whole new life. You're a part of a new team, new family. So got to put it behind you and just go forward."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"Goals I wish to accomplish is win an NBA championship, multiple-time All-Star and ultimately be a Hall of Famer and one day be listed as one of the greatest ever."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"But ultimately I just want to win championships and be labeled as a winner, always deep in the playoffs, somebody always competing for championships. That's what I want to be."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"I really didn't expect it, but I knew it was a possibility. So when it didn't happen, I wasn't surprised. All the guys up for the pick are great players. They bring a lot to the table."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JABARI SMITH JR,"Like I said in other interviews, it was a coin flip. When it happened, I just was happy for him, clapped for him and just waited to hear my name called."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,SHAEDON SHARPE,"My first sport growing up was hockey, so I did like pro skating. And in terms of like festivals, I did go to like Sunfest and some other ones."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,SHAEDON SHARPE,"I'll probably invest my money into some type of crypto or something, or even just help my family out. But in terms of like playing against an NBA player, I'd probably say LeBron."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,SHAEDON SHARPE,"Well, originally I played football. I went from hockey to playing football and then basketball. But I mean, I just found the love playing basketball with friends and family. We would play outside, in the gym at the Y. I just fell in love with it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,SHAEDON SHARPE,I feel like basketball is taking over in Canada just because we've had many draft picks come out of Canada.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,SHAEDON SHARPE,"So yeah, I feel like it's taking over. But hockey is still in Canada. So it's two sports."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,SHAEDON SHARPE,"I really had no clue, honestly. I mean, when I found out where I was going, it was the same time you guys found out. I really just soaked in everything and just had fun with it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"I'm excited. I'm excited to get down there. I feel like for me, the first thing that I feel like I bring to the Kings is just a winning culture, winning mindset. I think that'll be special for me, to be able to get down there and help them win and see success in that."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,So I'm excited to go down there and play with a lot of really good players. I'll open it up for questions.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"First thing I'm going to buy with my paycheck, probably pay some bills and some groceries. Nothing crazy. I'm not flashy or anything like that. I'm excited to just -- not anyone specific, just go against all the guys you see on TV, the Hall of Famers that have made their mark on the game already."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"I'm excited to compete, and that's the biggest thing, against some of the top guys in the NBA."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"Yeah, it was special. For me to have them here has been a blessing. For them to hear my name be called on draft night, with my mom, my dad, my sister and my brother here, it's a really cool feeling."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,I think I'll never forget it. I'm just glad that I got this opportunity to be in this position I am today. It was all them. It's all I can say is that their hard work throughout the years when I was little helped me be here where I am today.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"Yeah, I got to talk to Coach a little bit. What they're all about is winning. I feel like for me, I bring that winning mentality right away with them. I know they've got a lot of good guys, a lot of pieces right now. What they're doing, that's to get to the playoffs and do damage in the playoffs."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"Right now the emphasis is winning, and I feel like I bring that."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"Yeah, I think that'll be special. There's not many guys that come out of Iowa and are in the league. For him to come out of Ames and do what he's done in the league and have the really great career is really special."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"I'm excited to get to know him a little bit. He's my teammate. Just excited because Iowa kind of has a different feel to it. I'm going to get down there and just try to build a great relationship with all the guys. With Harrison, it'll be really cool. It'll be special, for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"Yeah, I think playing alongside them, they all have experience and they've all been there. I think for me it's about learning from them and kind of being that guy that is always on their shoulder, always learning, things like that, to adjust to the league."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"I feel like it'll be really good for me and my career to be going into that scene, and I'm excited to get to work, for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"Yeah, I always have a chip on my shoulder. I mean, three years ago I was an unranked recruit going to Iowa, and I'll never forget that feeling."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"For me, I'll have that chip on my shoulder no matter what. I know that greatness takes time and I know that I have a long ways to go in my development as a basketball player, so for me it's being able to be the best version of myself and get down there and see what happens. I really think it'll be good."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"It's a great feeling. Especially to do that in two years. It's special. I've grown up next to University of Iowa, live 25 minutes away from it growing up. To have that under my belt I feel like is really special because a lot of great players have came through."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"For me, I wear it with pride. It's just it builds for future generations, for the Iowa basketball program, and it shows that you can come here and be special. It's not the most glamorous place in the world, but we get the job done."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KEEGAN MURRAY,"For me, it's a really great feeling."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BRYCE McGOWENS,"This day has been amazing, getting a chance to be here, celebrate this with my family. This was my dream since I can remember. So just being able to be here and get drafted, it means everything to me. I thank God."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BRYCE McGOWENS,"Yes, that's a great group of guys in Minnesota. So having the opportunity to go against them every day, learn and just compete against them is going to be major for me."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BRYCE McGOWENS,"Just a scoring spark, me being able to score at all three levels. Bringing in early leadership and just a competitive spirit."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BRYCE McGOWENS,Most definitely.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"Yeah, I mean, I bring my heart to the Pacers. I'm really fortunate for them to draft me. My goal is to have an impact already on both ends of the floor and bring W's to the team."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"To be honest, I'm not going to spend my money. I think most of it, I'm just going to save it. I'm looking forward to playing against Luguentz Dort a lot. We're from the same neighborhood, so he's the one."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"I feel like I'm pretty excited, to be honest. Tomorrow I'm going to wake up and be a Pacer. Just having the chance to play with Tyrese, Chris Duarte and the other guys on the team is going to be fun."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"Like you said, Tyrese likes to pass the ball. He can really pass the ball. He's a great teammate, as well."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,I'm really looking forward to playing with them and just having fun playing the game.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"I would say the NBA Academy helped me a lot. Just getting used to the NBA lifestyle basically, just living by myself. I come from Montreal. For the team, lived in Mexico for two years. Learned a new language, new culture, started eating tacos and stuff."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"I feel like it really prepared me. Just living by myself and being a grown-up at a young age, basically."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"One guy I'm really excited to play against is Luguentz Dort. We're from the same neighborhood. I used to see him, call him my big bro. Now we're at the next level, so it's about time for me to show him who's really the big bro. Looking forward to playing against him."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"Some players I like to model my game after are Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown. I feel like they're two really good comparisons for me, but also they're just two-way players and they're like dogs inside of them."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,BENNEDICT MATHURIN,"I mean, it's great. Those two players are really some players I put myself to."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"You know, I'm ecstatic. I'm excited for the opportunity. I know, as a kid, you look at this level of basketball and you don't really understand that it's a real thing, i's an attainable thing. And to finally get here, I mean, it's surreal. I'm just so excited."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"Yeah, super, super looking forward to it. Super excited about, just playing in the league in general. Just super excited."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,So I think just my ability to just be a defender. I think that's really what I did in college. And also just playing hard and just trying to win.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"It's a dream come true. I can't believe they said my name in this draft. I'm proud of it, and yeah, I can't wait to work."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day. Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career. I'm not worried about this."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,For sure. For sure.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"I think I'm going to have to work to improve my shot, my passing game, my running, too. I think I have to improve on my post play, too, offensive play, because I'm more a defensive player. Sometimes I'm thinking too much what I'm going to do on offense. Even if I have a good read, I have to make a quicker decision."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,I really look at Bam Adebayo's game because he can do everything on the court. It's a goal to be like that.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"I think it's a perfect fit for me, especially because they are a team who are contenders to win the title."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"I'm a competitive guy, so I always try to win. I think it's a perfect fit for me right now."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"There were a lot of plays in that game. I watched that game. I was actually at the arena for, what was that game, I'm not sure, Game 5 at Miami."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"But Game 7, you know, they were just unlucky. That's all I'm going to say. Things didn't work out how they thought they would. That's all."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"Of course, when you look at the game again, you always make a mistake. So they know already what mistakes they made and for sure they're working on it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"I think it's perfect because you can learn a lot from those guys, always, 247. I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot. I'm always trying to get more and more experience every day. With them, I'm sure I'm going to learn something new."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"First thing I'm going to buy, I'm not sure. Something for my family, for sure. I just want to get a gift for all of them because they are always here for me."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"I was in Miami for almost one month when I came for the draft process. I think the city is great -- nice weather, perfect weather. I met a lot of people there, really good people."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"So I like Miami, yeah. The funny thing is, it's the first city I came to when I came to USA, so I think it's a perfect one."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,NIKOLA JOVIC,"I don't think we are that familiar. I think our basketball IQ and passing, I think that's the two things that we can kind of compare. Of course, he's doing it on another level. And of course I'm looking forward. I never met him before, so I'm looking forward to meet him and to play against him, it's going to be really good."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"It's just a dream come true for me. You know, I can remember sitting, a young boy, watching some of the great players get drafted. I didn't want to stop until I was walking across that stage, shaking the commissioner's hand."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"It's just a dream come true. For all the kids that have dreams and aspirations, if they put their mind to it and they work hard, they can accomplish it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"It's actually an amazing story, to have a mother who has been in the league. You don't see too many stories like that, and the bond that we have is special. I thank her for all the things that she's done for me. I know I wouldn't be on this stage, I wouldn't be here, without her."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"It means a lot. I look up to Carsen. He's one of the reasons why I came to Purdue, just to see how much he worked. He's just a special talent. I'm excited to join him."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,My agents controlled all that.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"Yeah, they called me and just told me what was going on in the loop. I didn't dictate anything. So I'm just so blessed to be a Piston. That's the way it played out and I'm looking forward to getting down there."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"I think the biggest thing is if you want something in life, you have to work hard for it. I've seen her work late nights, watching film, working hard to make herself better."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"I just learned that from her, and it's what got me here today."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"Playing against, definitely LeBron, someone that I looked up to and idolized. Playing against him would be really great."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"I mean, after the workout, it was a great workout and I really liked the organization. I really had no clue where I was going to end up at. When I heard my name called, it was crazy."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"That question comes up a lot. I actually never really played my mom one-on-one. She was a coach. Her being a coach, I was trying to get all the help I can get, trying to learn new moves. Anything I can get from her, I would ask her for."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JADEN IVEY,"Definitely Ja Morant, Russell Westbrook, guys that have the speed and athleticism. I feel like I've been working on my mid-range a lot more this summer and I feel like I can showcase that as well. Players like Michael Jordan and D-Wade."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, it's a mix of emotions, probably a thousand emotions, all good ones. You know, I don't really have words to describe them, but I'm so blessed and grateful to be able to be here. I'm ready to compete. I'm ready to go play."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"I think it's a great situation, great dynamic, playing with guys like Josh and Shai, as well as everybody down the roster. It's a lot of great players there with unique skill sets. I feel like I can kind of pair up with them and help enhance theirs as well as have their skill sets enhance mine."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"On both ends. I'll start on defense. On defense, I can use my length and my quickness to cover a lot of ground and take up space. There's more space to take up, obviously, but I feel like I can still take up a great deal of space on defense, both vertically and horizontally, sliding my feet as well as protecting the rim."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"And on offense, OKC plays a very five-out style of basketball. There's a lot of space, especially in the paint to get to the basket or draw two defenders or drive and kick, find guys who are open. Like you said, a lot more space, and it opens up."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"I haven't really thought about that yet, as far as -- I'll probably end up buying a place to live. That will probably be the first thing."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"But playing against, it will be special to share the court with Jalen Suggs again. Obviously, we won't be wearing the same jersey, but to share the court with him would be special and to compete with him. Again, even though we are not on the same team, it will be a great day."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, I have a lot of motivations myself. I'm very intrinsically motivated. I wake up every day with a plan on how to make myself a better person, better basketball player. I put so much effort into executing that, that it doesn't really leave room to put effort into things that, one, I can't control, and two, don't help make me better."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"I tune a lot of that stuff out. I do see it here and there, but at the end of the day, I put no effort toward it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"I think and what I saw, speaking to personnel in the organization, and on my visit, they have a great organization as well as a great vision going forward. I'd say compiling the draft picks and all that is part of vision. Taking it one step at a time is important, especially for myself."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"You know, over time, that vision should pay off."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, I try to live with as few expectations as possible, so I can just completely be in the moment. That's one of the biggest things that I've tried to do today and one of the biggest pieces of advice I've gotten from many different people. Stay in the moment, soak it all in because it goes quick, and you can't relive it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"I've been 100 percent in the moment going with the flow today, and look where we are."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"It's definitely crazy. The lights don't get much brighter than this. You know, coming from a smaller place like Spokane and Gonzaga. But it reminds me, like the Oklahoma fan base and community, it me reminds me a lot of Gonzaga, our community. Super rowdy fans that are diehard for their organization. I'm proud to represent them."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,"I definitely appreciate my new teammate Shai. He's got the drip, for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHET HOLMGREN,We were just talking about over there how much competition I have now on the NBA tunnel walk-throughs. So it should be great.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,AJ GRIFFIN,"Man, it feels great. Just to know where you're going and to be able to play for the Hawks, I mean, it's an honor. I'm ready to get to the plane and work. I'm excited right now."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,AJ GRIFFIN,"I feel amazed. You know, just grateful to be able to be in the right spot. I'm just ready to get to work and play with a guy, Trae, I looked up to, just watching him play throughout the years. It's a surreal feeling."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,AJ GRIFFIN,"I was really just waiting for my name no matter who it was. Just to be able to be in the Draft, I was more than excited. I'm ready to go to ATL."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,AJ GRIFFIN,"Yeah, that moment is special. Just to be able to share that with my siblings -- growing up, we used to play one-on-one all the time and just dreamed about that moment. I think it's a memory I'm going to remember forever, and I'm sure they will, too."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,AJ GRIFFIN,"That's special, man, to have my coach there and to just feel the love from the community. I'm about to go get dinner with them. I just can't wait to say what's up and just enjoy this night with them."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,AJ GRIFFIN,"Man, he gave me so much advice. Just to be here today and just to share this moment with him, he just always told me the truth, always gave me the best advice a father could. I'm just truly grateful and blessed to be able to have a father like him. I'm just excited to see -- trying to get that first win against him."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,AJ GRIFFIN,"Yeah, it's definitely a blessing to have him as a father."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I think I'm just going to bring a defensive versatility and a competitive edge and just a winning mindset to the team.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,"It really just stems from my competitive nature. I believe that no one can score on me, or not, or I make it hard for people to score on me. I know it's the NBA and certain dudes are going to score and things are going to happen. But I pride myself on my defense and really just my competitive spirit always."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN DUREN,"Just definitely excited. I don't know if everybody knows, but I heard the pick was going to Detroit. So just happy to be in the NBA. Ready to get started. Excited."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN DUREN,"First thing I'm going to buy, I don't know. I haven't really thought of it. I know I definitely want to invest my money early and kind of start to grow."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN DUREN,"I'm looking forward to playing against everybody, playing at the highest level, all great players, all the greatest players in the world. I'm definitely just excited to see everybody."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JALEN DUREN,"I'm just happy to even get the opportunity, being blessed enough to be in the NBA. Not everybody gets the opportunity, so the fact that I'm here is good for me. I'm happy to play for any team and happy to be a Detroit Piston."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Honestly, I'm just excited to be part of the NBA. OKC is a young team. They have some French guys over there, so that will be cool."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,French is my first language.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"I think I need to buy a new phone because I need an American number, so I will need to buy that. And I want to play against KD."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"I heard about OKC. But I just want to play in the NBA no matter what city I'm playing in. Yeah, that's it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"I will improve on my decision making because everything is faster in the NBA, and probably keep improving my shot."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JOHNNY DAVIS,"A little bit. I mean, it's always nice to stay where I'm comfortable at in college, but I just think the opportunity that I have now and that I was given due to the way I played this past year, I don't think there was any chance I could have stayed."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JOHNNY DAVIS,I'll probably buy a car with my first paycheck. I'm looking forward to playing against anybody in the league. They are there for a reason.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JOHNNY DAVIS,"Basically anything. He's a really good player. I've watched him play for quite some time now, especially the way he scores the basketball. Watching him play with pace and shoot the ball is almost like looking at a work of art."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,JOHNNY DAVIS,"My insides just lit up, you know. I was very excited for that moment. I had been waiting for a long time, and more importantly, I'm really happy that my parents and my family are here to celebrate it with me."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"No, I don't. But you know, this is a one-off opportunity, the NBA Draft, so I had to put something together, a little shine on it."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"Not really. You know, it was good fun with the boys backstage. Some great suits tonight. So it was good to see some people and how they want to dress."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"I think Australian basketball has come a long way in the last few years. There's some great Australian players in the NBA. For me to represent the country of Australia means the world to me. Every opportunity I get to play for Australia, I want to take it. I love playing for it. I love the culture they've built there. And being able to hopefully play in the World Cup and the Olympics coming up, that would be a dream come true for me, just like tonight was getting drafted."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"I think with me there's so many different roles that I can play on a team, that I contribute in so many different ways. Especially on the defensive end, that's where I like to bring it. I can defend multiple positions, guard the ball and even go down and guard the post sometimes. With the ball in my hands, I can play-make, play without the ball, be a cutter, rebound and stuff like that. I feel like my game is very versatile and I could fit into a lot of different lineups with the great players that we have on this team."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"It's the NBA now, so everyone, really. It would be cool to play against my boy Josh Giddey. It would be cool to play against LeBron James and Russell Westbrook, who I idolized growing up."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,I'm just so happy to be a Pelican and I can't wait to get to work.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"The G League was huge for me. Playing against the NBA style of play, playing against NBA-type players, I had to learn how to play faster, more physical. Know when I could get mine. We had a great team and we had really good veterans and a really good coaching staff. I learned a lot throughout my year, and I think I improved as the year went on. The G League was definitely a really good step for me and helped me get here, for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"First thing I'm going to buy, I'm going to need a car. So I'm going to have to get a nice car. I'm a big car guy, so that would be one thing. But I'm sure Mom and Dad will get some as well."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"Yeah, I think that's huge. They made a really big step last year in making the playoffs, and did well in the playoffs, too."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"So I think being able to join this team, I think I can help them go further in the playoffs. And for me, I'm a winner. I love to win games. I hate losing. So I'm going to do whatever the team needs to help them win. I think I can definitely step into some roles and contribute straightaway."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"I worked out with the teams from like 5 to 11, so I was thinking somewhere in that range."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"But I'm just so happy I've landed in New Orleans. They have a great coaching staff, great players. I loved it when I went there for the workout."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,DYSON DANIELS,"I didn't really have an idea. My agent kept everything quiet, so it was a surprise to me. I'm so happy to be here."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MAX CHRISTIE,"It feels really, really good just to have my dream come true. I'm really living my dream, so it feels really, really good. That's the only thing I can sum up. I have a lot of emotions right now."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MAX CHRISTIE,"It's amazing. It's surreal. LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony -- the list goes on. A bunch of great names, a bunch of great players on the Lakers team. I think I can learn a lot and get a lot better in that organization."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MAX CHRISTIE,"I think Carmelo Anthony is a pretty good example, someone I can pick his brain. He's one of the greatest scorers of all time. I know he's a great player historically and he's a great player now, so he's someone I'll be looking to, for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MAX CHRISTIE,"Yeah, definitely. I think I'm ready to contribute, for sure, right away. I'm just happy to be part of the organization and contribute any way I can."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KENDALL BROWN,It feels great. It's just a relief to be able to be drafted to the NBA and just have the opportunity to show what I can do.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KENDALL BROWN,"It's going to be great. Me and Bennedict, we were training out there together, as well. So it's going to be cool out there, and just can't wait to get started."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,KENDALL BROWN,I would just say my IQ and my athleticism.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Yeah, the run was great, obviously. All the guys, it was amazing to see Ochai go tonight."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,"Just lessons I would take, Coach told me before, if you're going to try, the process to go, go two feet in. That's something I would say I took from this process and the championship game. It was an amazing moment for us."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MALAKI BRANHAM,"I'd probably say Dejounte Murray, just because he was kind of in the same range that I was, and also just hard worker and he's a great defensive player."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MALAKI BRANHAM,"There's a lot of rookie duties, and if you don't do them, you might like pay consequences for them. So I'm going to do all my rookie duties."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MALAKI BRANHAM,"Yeah, I feel like just me spacing the floor and me being able to knock down outside shots, I feel like I'm a good fit for that."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MALAKI BRANHAM,I worked out with them.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MALAKI BRANHAM,"It went good. We had a couple Lottery guys, first-round guys in there, and it went good."
