I feel like there's nothing like having them here with me and experiencing this with me and supporting me. There's no feeling like it, honestly."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"No, a hundred percent. I'm super proud of myself just sticking through that Australian season, knowing things were not going my way but continue to believe in myself every single day, and keep taking steps and getting better and looking at the bigger picture of my career. I feel like it's a great experience of being out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like Milwaukee was one of my best workouts I had. Even in the interviews at the combine and stuff like that, the interviews went really well. They just seemed like they had my best interests and they really liked me. So yeah, I kind of felt a little bit like Milwaukee would be the team that would want me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I would say that you just got to sometimes really just pop out and just show people, for real. You've just got to not want to duck or be scared. Believe in yourself more than anything and show people all the hard work that you've been putting in and the vision that you see and just put it out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,AJ JOHNSON,"I feel like him coming in the tenth game of the season for us as a team and giving us a lot of freedom and a lot of trust, I feel like it really helped our team as a whole just play better in general with the players we had.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"Yeah, it's all in the process there. The coaches there, the people are just amazing. Dayton does a great job of giving you the right pathway. It's all up to you if you choose to believe in that or not."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DaRON HOLMES II,"So they did that with me, Toumani Camara, Obi Toppin and all the guys before that. I decided to choose and I believe in it, and I'm here where I am now because of that. Very grateful for them."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"It means a lot coming from that program. Knowing that program just got shut down and I was the last bunch of that. Definitely taught me a lot on and off the court, really a lot of the things about life and being mentally healthy and just learning how the NBA operates."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"On the court, this might be surprising to say, but all the losing that we did, I definitely learned a lot more than if we would have won a lot. I think that definitely prepared me a lot for the NBA because you're going to go through a lot of things with the NBA. It's going to be a lot of things that you need to be able to talk about or just have an outlet to and just being able to figure things out quickly just to move on to the next."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I'm looking forward to changing things around. I know they have a stigma on them when it comes to a lot of losing, and I feel like I'm a huge part to be able to start to change that around. I have a willingness to win and I feel like me going into this franchise, being able to help them out with this good group of guys, good group of young guys that they have, I'm definitely super excited to get down there and get to work."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"I would say just talk to everybody that has been with me throughout this whole process and really sit down and tell them how thankful I am for that.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"Everything that I thought of came to life. Flashbacks from when I was young. Just dreaming of being in this position, walking across that stage in my mind. Hearing my name be called and walk across the stage today, it all came true. It was just God gave me this to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"It helped me a lot. That program at Lu High was probably the best decision I made, to go for my two years' program. I'm forever grateful to Coach John Buck and Coach Josh Corbin to give me an opportunity to play there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,Their practices are like college practices. So I was prepared to go into that. Just having the competitive mindset helped me a lot.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"I think it was Coach Bennett. I wasn't really known as a good defender coming out of high school. Once I got to UVA and had my growth spurt, I think I got some God-given talents. Coach Bennett drilled that mindset in me, and I was able to take off at Virginia."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"I'm excited. I'm excited. Great program. They want to win a championship and they have got great players to do it. I'm going to try to get down there, go to work and see what I've got to do to get there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RYAN DUNN,"Yeah, I think I can. It's just getting a lot of reps in practice and everything like that. Just getting the confidence and just let it go. That's what I'm going to try to do in Phoenix, is be in the gym a lot. Just do what I've got to do as a team."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's just a blessing, for real, to even be here because you work your whole life and you never know if you're going to make it. So when you finally get there, it's just a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"Yeah, playing with Anthony Edwards and the whole Timberwolves. They were in the Western Conference Finals. So it's really just a blessing because I get to learn from a lot of players and veterans and players that are real good. Them helping me is just a plus for me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I didn't really get to work out with them, but I used to see Ant at Overtime Elite a lot, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's a blessing to even be here in this situation. I thank the Timberwolves, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I would say the open space on the floor. There's so much open floor, and I feel like I'm quick so I can get past dudes. It's really the fact of me getting past dudes and making decisions. You're playing with a bunch of NBA players, so players can't really help off super a lot because these are NBA players and they knock down shots."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like, for me, getting past my defender and making plays for my teammates will be way easier, and then if they don't help, then it's just a bucket."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like it would be easier. Once I know the assignment and what my coach wants me to do, it's not really me adjusting. It's just me doing what he says. I feel like anything Coach tells me to do, I can adjust to and I can make it happen. So I feel like it's a good feel, for real."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"Me seeing Reed, my roommate, he's a great dude. He always pushed me and he always helped me. Me seeing him and we going together, it's just crazy to even see, and I'm thankful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Honestly, the workout went pretty well. I knew they were interested, but until the last minute, I didn't know where I was going. I'm very excited to start working. I can't wait."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,No. I'm planning on playing here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Obviously, I talked to the people over there. I got to learn more about the team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I was in the facility, everything. They showed me around. It was nice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think it's beautiful. I took a lot of risk. I left France when I was 17. So I did the last two years in Germany. I felt like it was a risk, and I believed in myself. I worked a lot and stayed confident."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"First, I would definitely say my brother, six years older. He was already playing basketball. But my first favorite player was probably KD."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I think I'm really versatile, but I can also bring what a rookie needs to bring in a team. Bring some energy. Being able to grab a rebound, push the ball but also knock down shots. I think it's very important for a rookie to bring these things."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"I don't know anybody personally on the team. But I talked with the coach, yeah."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"And yeah, it was nice to see him. I'm used to seeing him on TV. It was a little different, but I enjoyed it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I feel like I fit in great. I'm going to make sure that I get myself adjusted to whatever the team needs, whatever the players on that team need for us to be successful. With my high IQ and my versatility, I feel like there's a lot of different spots that I can fill and a lot of different needs I can address."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Basketball IQ, for sure. Making the right reads. Making smart plays. Being in the right position. I feel like that's very underrated, being in the right position and reading your defender. That's a lot of my game where I get my advantages from."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I'm going to continue it do that, and I feel like that's going to help everybody else on the floor as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Right, to the efficiency point. I feel like that's huge for me, just because I like to play the right way. I feel like me playing the right way is me getting good shots, whether that's open shots or good layups at the rim. I feel like I'm just reading the game and adjusting to whatever the defense does. When I get a good look, it's more prone to go in than not."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"And then to your other point, hopefully we'll make it three. That would be really historic. Yeah, Colorado is not looked at as a draft pick-producing university like these other programs are. But if you look at the history, there's a lot of really, really solid players that have stuck around a long time in the league. It's just a testament to what Coach Boyle and his coaching staff have done at Colorado."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,I'm excited to get to know them even more. We've got mutual friends. I've met them for the first time this past summer when my brother was playing on the national team and I went up there to Berlin to watch one of the games.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"But great people. They know my brother more than they know me, but they have already reached out to me through mutual friends. They make it very comforting to come to Orlando."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I talked with him earlier today, or tonight. I'm super excited, just learning from one of the great coaches. I feel like there's a lot that I can expand my game in, and I can't wait to learn even more. I feel like talking basketball and talking basketball IQ is one of my passions, as well, in the game. I'm just super excited to soak up all that knowledge and kind of grow."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"It's a blessing being here in the NBA Draft. One of many guys, and I'm just blessed to be in this space."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"I'm looking forward to playing with everybody, to be honest. I've heard a lot of great things about Utah. I'm just looking forward to learning a lot about it and living there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,I've never been to Utah. I don't think so.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ISAIAH COLLIER,"They are about to get a dog. I'm just looking forward to going in there and competing from day one, showing what I can do and just prove myself in the league in general."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, I mean, I'm really proud of Steph, happy for Steph. As a freshman, for him to come in and do what he did, help lead that team to another national title, is something very hard to do as a freshman. I love that kid to death. I'm extremely happy for him, and I'll be his biggest fan this year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it's been a crazy two years, from winning one national title to winning the Big East regular season to the Big East Tournament and then winning another national title. A lot of winning, a lot of succeeding the past two years. I feel like I'm going to keep that chip on my shoulder and go into Portland with just a lot of confidence, with a willingness to learn and get better every single day."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,I just want to have an impact and try to help this organization win and get to the top and try to win championships.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm really excited. I feel the connection with some of these young guys I've watched since I was in high school. Scoot Henderson, in particular. I feel like we have a chance to do something really special."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm young. Having a young team, just growing up around the same age, everyone learning and getting better every day, I'm really excited. I feel like I'm at a loss for words right now. I don't even know what else to say. I'm just excited and extremely blessed for this opportunity, and I'm really ready to get to Portland and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Being able to space the floor, knock down the three ball, playmake at a high level. I feel like I can handle the ball at the top of the key, pass the ball at a high level and I can shoot the ball at a high level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,One thing about me is I want to be a great teammate. I want to be the best teammate. I want to be the best player that Coach wants to coach every day. Coach is happy about coaching him because he gives his all. I want to be that guy. I'm just ready to get to work.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,It's a great feeling. You dream of this moment your whole life. You watch it on TV every single year. To have that moment here in front of you today and to hear my name called is something that I'll remember for the rest of my life.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"That was a really special moment. Like I said, I'm extremely blessed and grateful for everyone that has helped me to get to this point. I'm ready to get to work and ready to learn and ready to try to impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yes, I just did."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"It was great. I like Coach a lot. When I went out there for my visit, he was a good dude, great dude. The whole staff, the whole organization, you can really tell people that want to learn and want to win and learn and get better. That's something -- that's what I'm about, and I'm really ready to go get going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,Too young.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it just shows that we were the best program in college basketball and they still are right now. Coach Hurley is the best coach in college basketball, and he's producing players at a high level every single year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm not sure the exact number of draft picks he's had these past five years, but Coach Hurley has been the top of the top in college for a couple years now. I love that man to death."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DONOVAN CLINGAN,No. Just spend some time with some family. Soak everything in. Realize my life is going to change forever.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"They always told me that they were super high on me. But of course it's the NBA Draft, so you can't make any promises to anybody."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just can't wait to get out there and show my versatility, especially with the kind of talent that we already have on that team. It being the youngest team in the league right now, I feel like our future is pretty bright. I just can't wait to get out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"It's really hard to prepare for that moment. I mean, it's just a lot of emotions running through your head, especially when you hear your name being called."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"But on the basketball side of things, just always keep your head down, always working. Just staying humble and just having all that self-confidence in myself that everything is going to work out."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,I was just playing for the best coach in college basketball and now flipping to the NBA and going to play for a legendary coach like Coach Pop. It's a blessing.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"On the culture side of things, it's not really a big culture change from UConn to San Antonio. Just being out there in the pre-draft process, you can tell it's a hardworking program and super hard-nosed. I just can't wait to go out there and just show what I got."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Everything is just happening like really, really fast. Just being in the natty, soaking in that moment with my teammates, that's a super big accomplishment. And flip over to a couple months later and you another one of your teammates are top-10 picks. It really means the world to me and I wouldn't trade this for anything."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just talked to him on the phone not too long ago. We were just talking about coming down to San Antonio and just can't wait to get to work, and just excited for our future and excited for this upcoming season."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"It means a lot. Me and D.C. have been through so much together. I was friends with him before I got to UConn, before I committed to UConn. I've known him forever now. I mean, I know how much he's been through."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"For that to happen, it's such a great reflection on our program and just it's a reflection on all the hard work that we've put in. It's really a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Nah, he didn't tell me that as soon as I got drafted. That's probably a conversations we'll have a little later."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,It's all good.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,That's a castle for my last name. This is a castle.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,The last thing I'll do in probably just celebrate with my family. I was born here in New York. So I have a lot of family here at the draft. Just doing whatever I can to show how much appreciation I have toward them for all their support right before I go out to San Antonio and start my next journey.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,"Well, I mean, what I picked for the draft, it wasn't intentional. But I guess it all really worked out. I guess I kind of manifested it to happen for me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,STEPHON CASTLE,But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Oh, man, just want to thank God first, first and foremost, just for putting me in this position. I was ready to get ready to work. Coming in day one, do all the dirty work we need to do to win. I think I'm a winning player. I'm a win-now type of player, being one of the older guys in the draft. Just having that experience from college, and like I said, just doing all the dirty work, rebounding, diving on the floor for loose balls and just anything we need to do to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"I would love to play alongside Malik Monk, De'Aaron Fox, I think we have a great big in Sabonis, probably one of best passers in the NBA from a big standpoint."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"I'm just ready to be a two-way, versatile player. Get stops on one end, and I can also create some offense not only for myself but my teammates on the other end."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, I did work out for the Kings. Honestly, one of my better workouts, I believe. I think we had a very fantastic meeting with everybody who made the decision to draft me. Just very thankful for that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Me and Coach Brown talked, how we see myself fitting in on the team, and just coachplayer talk. I think I got a good feel for Coach and he got a good feel for me. Just ready to start in journey."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"It means everything. Just seeing his face whenever I got drafted, how happy he was, he didn't get a chance to get drafted. So just seeing his face and how excited he was for everything that we've been through, working out, countless hours throughout the night, morning. It's just a very special moment. Came up with handshake today and almost messed it up, but it's all right. We got it done."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, just me being confident, like I said, I know the type of player I am. I know what I bring to the court. I know I just wanted to give Kim the same promise he gave me when he first came to Providence, that he'll make me one of the better players in the conference. Just want to give him the same promise I got a seat for you at the green room table."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DEVIN CARTER,"Just a mature, win-now, do-it-all type of player. Like I said, rebounding, dive on the floor, take charges, anything that is needed to do to win. Just very excited to play with some great players, and hopefully we can win a championship."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"I'm feeling about as good as you think I'd be feeling. It's a special feeling to finally be here and have my name called, and especially being so close to home. You know, that means a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"It means a lot. Definitely because I would say when I was younger, I wasn't really like that in my area, and to now be sort of that guy that people want to see, especially being from the area and now back in the area. It means a lot to finally see all the stuff that I've done come to light."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,I haven't even touched my phone yet.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"Definitely. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he has texted me already."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"Probably say he'll be at the first game, and ""Don't suck."" Something he would probably say to me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"For sure, yeah, he ain't got no choice."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,BUB CARRINGTON,"I would say the biggest adjustment would be how they game plan. It's real strategic for the league. I'm starting to see that working out for all these different teams. They have a real game plan and strategy going into every single game, and if you don't execute it, you can't play. I feel like that's something I'm going to have to get adjusted to."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,Feeling good. Super blessed. I'm ready to work. I'm going to give the Bulls organization everything I've got.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"Super excited, man. I mean, this is a dream come true. I've been thinking about this since a young age. It means the world to me."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"I'll dress well, but I'm worried about basketball. I'm not really worried about that. I want to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"Chicago is a winning program and I want to win. So being there, I can embrace it. I fit many different ways on the team. I feel like I can do everything on the court. Whatever Coach asks me to do, I'm going to do to the best of my abilities and I'm going to work hard."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,See my family. That's it.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"The program did an amazing job, even when they had the shutdown. Look at all the picks that they had. Everyone is good. All the coaches are amazing. They did a great job with everyone that they produced. I can't thank them enough, honestly. I would do it ten times over again."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,MATAS BUZELIS,"How do I feel it improved my game? Being around NBA coaches, veterans, just being in the NBA atmosphere, playing NBA rules and all that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"It was amazing, amazing to be able to be in this position. After everything that happened last year with me and the injury and everything, you learn more to appreciate and cherish the moments and opportunity you're given. Tonight was one of those times where you just realize being in a locker room full of some greats in the NBA and the best players in the world and be able to be out here and be able to represent my country and my organization, I just wanted to cherish this moment and make the most of it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,I didn't know it was going to be 50. I thought maybe it was going to be more like 15. But God is good. It's Sunday. I'm blessed to be in this situation.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"It's great. Like I said, it's a huge honor. It's all because of my teammates. My teammates tonight kept finding me and passing me the ball."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I just was trying, like I said, to take advantage of the opportunity and make some shots. I wish I could have made a little more, but beggars can't be choosers on a night like this."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"Indy is great. Indy is such a pinnacle of basketball. I had such love for Indy watching them. For me growing up, Reggie Miller was the guy that just was electric to me, especially his shooting. So to be able to be in the house that Reggie Miller, Larry Bird, Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest -- you know, we could keep going down the list. Even people like Monta Ellis, I want to give a shoutout to."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"To be in the building where they had historical moments, it's really special."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"Absolutely. Like I told him on the court, GOAT. He's one of those guys that probably will never come again. The talent, his ability to overcome all adversity and his ability to exceed people's expectations. Just tremendous respect for LeBron, tremendous respect for what he's done and the impact he's had on the game of basketball."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I'm just -- it's crazy. I'm just blessed to be with -- I have no kids, but I tell my niece and my nephew that they get to see their uncle playing with LeBron James, it's a really cool experience for those children to have those childhood memories."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I knew I had a lot, but I knew Ant was the one as always -- it's always Ant -- was looking at me saying -- he was breaking down the points to me on the bench. I knew it was something special because even Steph got up and was like, Get 50! Get 50!"
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I hadn't been shooting the three ball well all night, but when I needed them to go in, they definitely did. God was good. I just was honored to be in the moment. I definitely tried to go the reverse through the legs. I couldn't make it in the All-Star Game, but I made it in a real game. Kind of funny how I did that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"Just my teammates getting me the ball. Especially when you're a big, you never know what's going to happen. For my teammates to trust me and want to give me the ball was just an honor and a blessing."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I've really got to say, I think it was great coaching. The play calls and stuff like that, they're fantastic. I would love possibly one day to be able to play for this coaching staff if everything lines up."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,I got hopes and dreams.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"He was in the locker room before the game. Him, Adam Silver, and Dr. J, they were talking to us. Once they got done, I thought I was going to be able to shake his hand. I turned around, and he was gone."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"I remember I was standing there like I never met Larry Bird. I've never been in the same room with him. As crazy as it sounds, it's never worked out."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"So Taylor, our PR girl, saw him before -- I was sitting on the sidelines, and she grabbed me. She was like, He's over there. I got a chance to go meet him and tell him how much of an honor it was to meet him. He told me he was looking forward to meeting me. So that was crazy to hear him say that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"He's a lot taller than I thought he was. But obviously what he means to the game, what he means to the city of Boston and the Celtics, he's the ultimate Celtic. It was an honor to meet him."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"All-Star Weekend is special, and it's always more special when you get to share it with a teammate or two. I've been fortunate enough to share it with him three times now. It was great. It was great to have a teammate, familiar face around, especially we get to share the same locker room."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a special weekend for us, for our families, obviously for our team, the Celtics. So it's always great."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"Much deserved. Like you said, we scored 200 points. We had three guys score over 36 points, so it could have went either way. But Dame put on a show. I was happy for him. It was cool that I could take a backseat this year and kind of chill and get to enjoy the show a little bit."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"Actually, I got to talk to him before the game started. The time difference is a little crazy. He actually is up -- he's a Finalist for Coach of the Year. He started off as an assistant coach, and the head coach got let go, and halfway through the season."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"They were like in the 10th or 11th seed, and how he kind of turned around. They're in the 4th seed going into the playoffs. Extremely obviously happy for him. Happy for what he's been able to do over there and kind of turn that organization around."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,He loves it. He loves it over there. He loves being in Australia. He says the games are extremely competitive. The atmosphere is crazy. Hopefully they can continue and go all the way. But it's been great to see him turn that thing around and have a lot of success over there.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"Meeting Larry, it was super quick. I had told him it was an honor to meet him, and he told me he was looking forward to finally get to meet me. Then we took a picture. So we didn't get to talk in detail."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"It's much better being on the same team with JB. It's what I'm used to. We've competed against each other in practice for seven years now, so I'm kind of tired of doing that. So it's good to be on the same team for sure."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"It's extremely important. Being an All-Star is obviously a reflection of the work that you've put in your whole life, the work that you've obviously put in the first half of the season, but it should be celebrated with your family. Nobody is successful by themselves. Everybody has a support group, people to help raise them, support them through ups and downs."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"So this time this weekend is for obviously yourself, but to bring your friends, families, partners, or whatever it may be to this event, to this weekend because there's a lot of activities and things like that, and there's just memories. Memories that build with the people who essentially help you get to this moment."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"I loved it. The shorter introductions, not being on the stage and all that, I'm definitely a fan of that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"East versus West, I thought it was cool. This is my first All-Star Game experience in East versus West. So that's kind of what I grew up watching. I enjoyed that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I liked it better this year honestly. It was a regular game. Halftime was a little shorter, and the introductions was a lot shorter. So it felt like a little bit more normal of a game than past years."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"I think it's my responsibility. I understand the platform that I have and the position that I'm in. I'm in a position to inspire a lot of kids and a lot of people, and I think, as we all were inspired by somebody. I feel like, as you grow up, you should always keep that in mind, that somebody inspired you to get where you are today."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,JAYSON TATUM,"The larger your platform, I feel like the larger your responsibility is. Growing up from St. Louis, I always had it in my mind that I wanted to impact my community. I wanted to change and make St. Louis a better place than when I grew up. I didn't always know how to articulate that when I was younger, but from a very young age, I knew that I was going to be where I'm at today, and that I was going to inspire kids and help change lives back where I'm from."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,I actually did it because Bron be doing it. Bron was in front of me. I thought let's just try it.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"No. Honestly, I don't really shoot one-legged threes. It was really a spur of the moment. I just saw LeBron is in front of me, and I figured why not go ahead and shoot a one-legged shot."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"Fortunately, I've been around a few times, so it wasn't my first time. But it's always a blessing, especially for the older guys. You've got Steph, LeBron, KD. Those three in particular, those are Hall of Famers, top-tier guys. It's always a blessing to share the court. As long as you can, you treasure those moments. Hopefully I'm talked about in the same category as my career continues to move forward."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,It never gets old. You just find ways to enjoy each moment and embrace it.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"I told him he should have went for it before we started the game. He is back from injury, so he tried to pace it, I guess. I told him go ahead and go get it. He started off hot. Dame got going. There was a lot of scoring tonight."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"Not at halftime, there was no talk of it. That's the thing with athletes, though. You kind of have this within the game, and you could see it out there. Karl was going for it, J.B., Dame. You can see it. I think that's what makes it special, because now you've got guys taking shots and putting themselves in certain categories."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,Appreciate it.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"You've just got to keep shooting the ball. I think, in a game like this, you know it's going to be pretty loose, and you're going to get your opportunities. Being in the starting lineup, I knew I'd play longer stretches, get more minutes."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I just told myself I'm going to be aggressive, and I'm going to keep firing. I saw a couple go in. After that, it was just like I'm going after it. So that was it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"The first one, I was super, super loose. Then the last one, I was actually kind of stiff. So I just had to shoot it a little bit higher. I got two of them in."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think overall it's just our lockers are next to each other's. When you go somewhere outside of your team with a teammate, you usually naturally turn to each other more, just a lot of conversation. We're sharing our own experience away from this when we get around other groups."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Our coach was the coach. So a lot of our staff was around the whole time. I think it was just a positive weekend for us because we just had a lot of interactions. We were able to have conversations about where our team has been lately and what we want to do, how we can help each other better."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think, when you can break away from not only the season and have All-Star break, but also break away from the team and us be able to just be man to man and kind of just bond like that, it's always helpful."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Like you said, me being able to come here and see how he's viewed around the league and him also to be able to come here and see how I'm viewed around the league. I think that just helps with any type of dynamic when you're trying to accomplish what we're trying to accomplish."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think people who are fans of the game, they love it. They enjoy being entertained. I think it could be more competitive. I think in our game right now it's such a fast-paced game. We play a lot of games. The game has probably also had more injuries than it's ever had."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Usually our preparation to get ready to compete, it looks a lot different than it looks when we come here. This weekend was a lot better than the past, but I think when the game is any type of loose, if it's not a game where you've got a scouting report and you're locked in and a lot is on the line, then guys who are too talented, are going to make a lot of threes. That's the kind of game it's going to be."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Any time you're mentioned in the same category as Mike, it's an honor, and it's a major accomplishment, even if it's All-Star Weekend. If it was that simple, more people would have done it since 1988. So that's a major compliment for me to be mentioned in the same conversation as far as that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Like you said, it's been a tough year, just the transition, being on a new team. We've had three coaches since I've been there. We've had coaches leave. Moving across the country. I've been on the West Coast my whole life with my whole family right there, just a tight group always in place."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think any time you have these types of experiences where you have an adversity and things not just flowing like you expect it to or like you would want it to, I think that's the time you've got to just show who you really are. You've got to keep doing what you do, keep believing. When you do that, usually it comes back to you. There's some type of reward that comes forward."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"You can't just fold. And that's what my mentality is. I did come into the weekend, when I knew I was going to do the 3-Point, I was like I'm going to try to win. I'm not going to be casual and cool about it. I'm going to try to win again."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"And I'm going to come into the All-Star Game, my first start, I know I'm going to be on the floor a lot. I'm a vet in the game at this point. Why not go and try to get an MVP? Since I've been here enough."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I saw the ball go in, and I started to do that. But I wouldn't say it was validation. It's just something I put my mind on, and that's going to be what my intentions are this weekend, and I was able to do it."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think something could be done about it. I'm not sure what, but I think there's a way to make it a more competitive game. I don't think anybody is going to play in it like it's the playoffs, but it's a way to get guys to come to the table and just play a more solid game, I guess."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"But I did think it was a good game. Any time the crowd is engaged and you're hearing oohs and aahs and things like that because, if the crowd isn't enjoying what they're seeing, they're not going to say nothing. I've seen it. They'll just sit there and watch."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I thought it was enough moments to be excited about and enjoy watching. But it was probably too much leak-out, go get a dunk, go get a layup type of moments. If we could limit those, people wouldn't feel the way they feel sometimes about it, if we could just try to limit it. It's going to happen sometimes, but it probably can't happen as much."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think this is the most success I've probably had in one All-Star Weekend. Had a few launches with some of my partners, won the 3-Point, won the All-Star Game MVP. So it's been a successful weekend. I think any time you get to be a part of this, that's what anybody would want."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"You want to come here and have success, so I had that. It's just been a good break. Just being around my family, being able to just do the things that I've always done."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"But going forward, it's just like you've got to recharge and get ready for the closing stretch and try to just get our team to where we need to be so we can go after what we want to accomplish this season."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I think as a kid growing up and loving the game of basketball and watching the NBA All-Star Weekend and seeing the Sunday game, I always had dreams and visions if I was able to play the game at a high level and give everything to the game, hopefully I could be a part of that game someday."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,It's just been an absolute honor to be able to grace the floor throughout my career and be out there with the greatest players in the world year in and year out.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"This is very humbling, very blessed, and it's something I will never forget obviously. It's part of my journey."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"That's most important. Yes, I did seek treatment the last few days, trying to get my ankle as strong and as back to where I feel confident that I can finish off this last third of the season."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I won't be playing the entire game tonight, for sure. I can get out there and run around with the young guys for a little bit and then shut it down at some point to give my body, and my ankle more importantly, another opportunity to rest."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I'm seeking some more treatment tomorrow going into this week, because we have quite a few days this week as well. We don't play until the end of the week. See how that goes. But the most important thing for me is definitely my health, where I'm at right now, where our team is leaning. We're trending in the right direction."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"Obviously, with our Laker team, it's been about health all year. Trying to do what's best for me for the betterment of the team."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"Yes. I think for me, I can affect the game in a lot of ways. At this point in my career, it's still the same way. I can affect the game by being on the ball, being off the ball, cutting from the weak side, slashing from the weak side, running in transition. I have the ability to shoot the ball in space at more frequency at a higher level than I was early in my career. So I've worked on that."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"My mind is just sharper than anything. It's allowed me to go out there and sometimes just outthink the game and not have to physically be imposing out on the floor for 40 minutes or 42, whatever the case may be that I'm out there. I could pick my spots."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"I guess each team is going to dictate what your defense allows you to do or what you want to take away. At the end of the day, we're All NBA players, and you can't take away everything. Guys are going to score, guys are going to shoot threes, guys are going to put up numbers. It's what you're willing to give up, not what you want to take away."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,LEBRON JAMES,"Every team is different. Every team's portfolio is different of how they attack the game. If you do your scouting, if you do your research, you know players' tendencies, you can be proactive more than reactive."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My conversations were great with T Spoon. As you know, she was coached by Coach Mulkey, so I kind of thought maybe I'll go there. Knowing like the conversations were so good and she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a Black woman and as a head coach, and everything she's done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Obviously, I know how my size is an advantage. So I don't want to get too much into staying on the perimeter. I want to be able to mix it up and always keep the defense off balance. That's something that I think me, my coaches, we always try to balance and work on is how much I'm handling, how much I'm inside and just trying to find that perfect balance."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,But they went to another level. So they kind of took us out of a rhythm. Not surprised us. We knew what they are capable of doing. But we've got to get back and just play Liberty basketball.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Just like our 2016 championship that was lost -- officiating, missing a shot clock violation. This sucks. This is for a championship for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams. This isn't that hard."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Trying to manage everybody, trying to protect yourself and not get injured and take away from what you ultimately want to accomplish, I think is something we prioritize. But it's a lot that goes on when you come here for this game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"We just take it on the chin, you know. We were up a lot and then we had a wild kind of sequence to end the fourth. Didn't start overtime great. I had a great look at the end and I didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"So I tell these guys, for whatever reason, it didn't work out. It just doesn't feel right that you lose a series with that level of discrepancy. We don't have a team that whines and complains and all that stuff. Sometimes it probably hurts us. Maybe being a little more, I don't know, something. But you have a star player like Phee, that just, I don't get it. I don't get how she can be held and go to the basket and get hit, and then a marginal, at best, at best, sends their best player to the free throw line. I mean, that's tough. It's tough to swallow."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Yeah, it's kind of crazy. I played with everybody. It's nice seeing your country being one of the most represented in the NBA. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of everybody. The French people that went to the NBA, it's big. It's coming from a different continent. We have to really work to get there. Yeah, I'm really proud of everybody."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, so obviously one of our focuses this year of our social justice council is reproductive rights, as well as civic engagement, given that we're in a general election year. So the one thing I like about our players, our players want to be engaged. They don't run away from things. They want to be engaged and they want to force change in the communities in which they live and work, and they do it very, very effectively. I think on this issue they'll continue to do that effectively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But if they are not falling, they are not falling. I'm not going to let that affect the way I do things. So continuing to be there for my team. I didn't talk about this, but before I made the free throws, I missed two free throws. I was like, no, I can't do this again, I can't. I have to be here. Olaf Lange, him and I have talked about being a python, where it's like you know your moment when to strike. At that moment, I was just thinking about being a python."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I got really emotional because the main goal was to get here and being able to give my family a better life, and just by looking at them and seeing them at my table was amazing. I obviously get emotional when I talk about my family because I'm so proud of everything I was able to accomplish and do for them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"No, it is the margin. It is the margin. But I hear what you're saying, in that when it mattered, we got some hustle plays. And we always say, you never know which one is going to be the difference between winning and losing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, I think the more I develop, I'll definitely be able to initiate offense at the one. Played two and three before. I think playing in the NBA, playing around in practice, I think I'll start to get used to it more, and then I think I can really take that role to the next level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"He just told me, ""Welcome, teammate."" That means a lot for me because he accepted me. He stood up to shake my hand. It's really great to have him there. He's coming into the third year, and he's done a really good job the past two. And not just him, the players and the whole organization. I think we can do more."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,It's a shame that officiating had such a hand in a series like this. Obviously there's always going to be a team that's going to be a little more disappointed than the other.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,THE MODERATOR,"There's no practice tomorrow, so...."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be patient. You've got to be patient. They're not always going to do things that you like. Be patient because they're kids. I think that's the most important thing.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think 200 is a lot to be scored. It just shows that we didn't go out there and compete like I guess you would want us to or whoever would want us to. But I think that's just what it is. Guys are talented. Make a lot of shots. We hit a lot of threes, and that was it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Always. That was always my motto. Just be patient and be myself and continue to work hard every single day. That's the best way to do it because if you don't, you try to rush the process, things aren't going to go your way."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"To this point, it's not any harder, because I've grown through it being hard, I think, in the past."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Lastly, I have been very reflective over the past couple weeks with all the hype and talk about this draft class and the WNBA. Surviving the existential time of the WNBA wubble, raising that 75 million in capital in February of 2022 as the first women's sports league to do so at that scale, deploying it against our key priorities. Almost as if we knew we had to be ready for this moment, and we are."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"It's always been that way with NBA, and since the social media era, you see more and more of that. I think guys in the past have stood up for what they believe in, social issues in the league, and that's given us the confidence to go out and do it as well in this generation."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that expletive timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it."
