2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, they complement each other very well. They are both three-level scorers. They can both use the pick-and-roll. One setting it, one coming off of it, vice versa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me. But to my teammates and the fans there, they're getting a big-time player and even better person. Just somebody who is going to bring it every day, push the people around me. Just someone that is going to work hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really proud of what our owners -- this is something, the owners actually appoint and pay the coaches, that our owners have stepped up to do. I think it's something we have our eye on, we had our eye on as soon as I came into the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sport is something that always in Serbia was something that put in front of us everybody, even like 10, 20 years ago, whatever, but now when we have Djokovic who won, probably the best ever. For us he's the best ever of course, and now we have our NBA championship, and I think it's a really good moment to be a Serbian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,It's like four or five.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day. Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career. I'm not worried about this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think as a group, I think we've found ways that we've gotten great looks. I think we've found a little bit of a rhythm offensively. We haven't made all the shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,Also just taking our time and trying to get this win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the moment, it's us, our coaching staff, our players. But this was for all Nuggets. That was what was really cool about it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I wouldn't say that it was a lineup change. I get what you're saying. We just went back to our original lineup. We went with this lineup for 14 games. I didn't have the foresight, I didn't. That's on me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I've heard that. Yeah, I don't know. Just my father's last name, as well. I don't know. I guess I've got like H's in my family or something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just an amazing duo. They've been together for the longest, and just how comfortable they are with each other and how they know each other's tendencies and what works for them and us as a team. It was just truly amazing to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"That's three 6'9"", 6'10"", 6'11"" guys who can dribble, pass and shoot, have high II think that's going to be a huge advantage for us and a struggle for other teams to game plan for."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"Yeah, super, super looking forward to it. Super excited about, just playing in the league in general. Just super excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, we have player personnel sheets and booklets essentially that we can go through and study players' tendencies, what their strengths are, what they like to get to, how they're most effective. Then I just kind of go through that, treat it like a Bible for the next couple of days and just stick to the script."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"For sure. It's something I take pride in, the defensive end. Having that opportunity, having that role, is something I'm really looking forward to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I think it's a standard that we hold ourselves to and that we have held ourselves to all year long. We've been building habits day in and day out. So, you get to a game like this, the biggest stage in basketball, you let your standard of play and you let your habits carry you."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I had a feeling from the information I was being told is that it was just kind of up in the air. Orlando wasn't really sure yet, and just to be ready for whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, to be honest, it's something that -- since year one, whoever was kind of speaking my language or I'm trying to kind of stay in touch or whatever, some guys maybe a little bit more, some guys a little bit less, but I'm trying to stay in touch with everybody."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, I think I knew the Fever were interested, but you never know until draft night obviously happens. I wasn't getting my hopes up or anything like that. Was just keeping an open mind."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We decided that given that investigation was ongoing and it remains ongoing, that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to work in these Finals. I don't know what the ultimate conclusion will be. We'll see where the facts take us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, I think that's -- Nikola never tries to impose his will or force things that aren't there. He's going to read the game. He's going to make the right play. Most importantly he's going to make every one of his teammates better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I think defensively he is definitely one of the best defenders out there. I credit that to his IQ but also his activeness with his hands.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think it's an opportunity to learn. You watch the film, go to school on it, try to take away some things that you did well, and then certainly learn from some things that you can do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, it seems like they've prioritized that, just maybe helping a little bit less on drives and staying home a little bit more. So it's an adjustment. It's something that we're used to and we feel like we can still generate good three-point looks. It's just going to be a matter of running good, crisp offense with pace, full court and half court, and then just playing to our strengths."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I really haven't thought about free agency at all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, there's lots of moments, kind of when there's a pause in the action, I guess, if you will, to kind of step back and be appreciative of the journey. When you're in it throughout the day to day, you're just focused on what's next. Obviously your perspective shifts and changes as you advance in your career and you want more for yourself, because we're all competitive people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Sometimes a dream is deferred, and our dream was deferred for a few years, but we stuck with it, and we added the right pieces. Huge shoutout to Calvin Booth and the job he's done. This is just an unbelievable feeling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,P-Wat has a great feel for the game and a chance to be a really great player for this team and to help this team along the way. I'm excited for P-Wat and the experience that he has gathered thus far.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Just enjoying and embracing this moment, I think that was the biggest lesson. I feel like I truly embraced it. I was very excited just to see my name pop up. It didn't matter if it was first round, second round. I'm just excited to be here. I know they're going to be always around me. I'm always going to be part of the Huskies family. I can always go talk to coaches, call them whenever, even the alums. It's just a big family. So it's nice to have them as my support group that I can always go to and ask questions about the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, when you play a team numerous times in a row, you've got to know what's coming. They know what we're doing, we know what they're doing. We're going to keep adjusting, mixing things up, but everybody is -- he's locked in. KCP is -- it's a defensive game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Not too much. The main focus through this pre-draft process was everything on the court. That's what it's always going to be for me, just keeping the main thing the main thing. But obviously there's stuff to talk about off the court. So later on the road, obviously. But as of now, I'm excited to get out there tomorrow. I can't really put into words how I'm really feeling about it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Tim Connelly hired me and brought me to the table here, and my countless conversations in my seven years with Tim, we would always talk about how we had the luxury of working for a group with Stan and Josh and the Kroenke family that is not going to be just a quick trigger. We have to make a move. We have to make a move. They were willing to take a step back and see this thing through."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and all of our head and assistant coaches, I'd like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, John Hareas, Mike Levine, Mark Broussard and so many people at the NBA, and for all the league support and assistance in providing this tremendous platform for our great coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Everything, man. We were there I think for five days. We saw Christ the Redeemer, we went to different beaches, different places to eat, as well as seeing all the basketball fans over there and how the game has grown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"So really excited to be drafted, excited to get to Dallas and get into training camp."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Las Vegas tell us that we were underdog before. That doesn't... It's not correct, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,The day I walked through the doors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Nah. I had one of my high school teammates who played for the Heat at the time, so I saw him a lot. But other than that, no."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with. So I'm fortunate enough to be able to be the one right now that's in the limelight, to be able to represent our area the best I can, and I look forward to being able to represent Miami, as well, and trying to get this title."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well."
