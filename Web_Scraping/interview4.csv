2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But just continuing to stick together, and I think also, the biggest thing behind it is like not getting too high or too low, you know. Things are going to seem bigger than what they are because they are playing at home, and I'm sure Minnesota said the same thing when they are playing here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"But yeah, we like to go on the road."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, obviously I stayed up watching the game, not too late laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"But it was a nail-biter. But I mean, after they won the way that they did, today I was like, yeah, I'm going to wear my Oregon shoes because I wanted to embody that tough, gritty win that they pulled off, which is probably one of the biggest wins that our program has had there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,"A lot of things didn't go right for them and they just continued to fight and stay together and grind out a really big win. I was like, all right, I want to bring that energy with me today on the court and kind of do the same thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SABRINA IONESCU,So I think I'm going to wear the same shoes again on Wednesday.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,SANDY BRONDELLO,Lucky shoes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,We are the first team in WNBA playoff history to be down 15 and come back and win the game. So that ranks really high.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it defines our team in terms of being able to get through difficult times. That's what we say, we've been talking about, all these interviews we've been given, that's what we are talking about You have to be mentally tough and resilient. You have to look inward and not blame other people, and give each other confidence."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"And we were that team. You know, thrilled that we could hang in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I mean, he believes in us like we believe in ourselves. I think we have such a tight-knit circle with our families involved as well, and we all know what we can do in that. We never give up."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,He embodies all of our families. They all believe that we can come back and we can win and we can stay composed and hopefully win. The basketball gods were on our side tonight.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"Honestly, whatever the folks want to call me, I'm with whatever. As long as they're showing love. If you show me love, you can call me whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"That's just a testament to how we believe in each other. We have so many great three-point shooters, and the fact that these girls are out here trying to get me the ball, I mean, I could cry. This is amazing. I love it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I say that all the time, and I don't say that for fun. These people I'm around, we believe in each other so much. It's crazy, man. I'm happy to be here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"From a basketball standpoint, Courtney recognized that she had to get more aggressive. Not pick up her dribble. Her team needed her to be aggressive to go score the basketball. We needed some help. Phee got going as well. But Courtney has been around for a while. She has been in Finals games, and she knows her team needed her to get aggressive."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I think just taking it one possession at a time. We've been in situations where we've been down before, and that's when we really lean on our defense. That's something we were talking about, getting three stops in a row, chipping at it a little bit at a time. Not thinking about the point difference, but thinking about the possession that we need to get a stop and a score. That's just what we were talking about at halftime."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Just every game, I try to go out and impact defensively. Especially when they are going on a run like that, they have amazing offensive players, and so trying to be as disruptive as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It just goes in preparation. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us and playing tendencies and just playing defense.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Again, they are great offensive players. They are going to make plays. I just have to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I don't know where it ranks. It's 1 right now because we are here. I like to be where my feet are planted. So it's 1 right now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy she made a clutch free throw, if you go and look --"
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,Laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"That helped her a little bit, clutch free throws, that was good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I messed that up laughing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't feel that way. Those are your words.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"We know it's a long series. Nothing is won in the first quarter. It was not the first quarter that we were hoping for. What our narrative was in the timeouts was just we had to find our footing. Find our footing defensively, and we did the second quarter. We held them to 12 after giving up 32. We went into halftime in good shape."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"No question about it, the second-chance points are really, really disappointing. That could have really cost us, and we were very, very fortunate that we overcame that. But defensively, we knew what we had to get done. Once our offense improved a little bit and we stopped turning the ball over."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,But they played terrific. I thought New York played terrific. Their pace was terrific. They run so many great things. They are unique in what they do. They found JJ repeatedly. She had a tremendous game. We had to overcome a lot.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"And then you look up at the end, and you know, we held them below 40 percent, which is monumental. A lot of that was obviously late. We got big stops when we needed them. Repeatedly, whether ball is going out of bounds or 5050 balls, referees, whatever happens, jump balls, fouls, all that stuff, we just had to be gritty at the end. We had to get stops to win and that's what I'm proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"Well said. Alanna is one of our highest WARP players, if you're into analytics. She's one of our highest. You know, like you said, she's not going to wow you. She's not going to fly around, scoring the ball, making post moves. It's not her. But what she does for our team, both offensively and defensively, it's not underappreciated, I can tell you that. It's a little bit understated. People have to really watch to recognize what she does for us. Fighting through. Every night, she's playing against the opposing team's big, and she's not big. And so if you look at the success that she has in doing that, it's the reason why we're sitting here today in the Finals. She's Second Team All-Defense, along with Collier as Defensive Player of the Year. Those two are the heart and soul of our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"That last possession, I think we learned from an earlier playoff game when we were down how we wanted to play that last possession. And so being aggressive and getting the three ball and do what we had to do, if one didn't go in, you know, get as many chances as we could get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"If the bigs weren't rebounding, might as well go small. Couldn't get any worse, right? What we wanted was a couple ball handlers, get downhill, try to get some easier stuff and pace, etc. That was actually, I don't know if it was Katie Smith or Rebekkah Brunson, but it was something that they asked for and it was a really good call."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it felt like we got a second chance. Obviously you don't want to be put in that position. Wish I wouldn't have fouled. Wish it wouldn't have been called, whatever it was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"But yeah, you're not thinking about that in the second. You're just thinking making sure they didn't get the rebound, making sure we're boxing out and going to our next play. So yeah, that's what I was thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I didn't know she was here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"She was texting to the bench. A lot of the good stuff we did, she was sending laughter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"The games that we were talking about, we were up. We were managing leads. We weren't finishing well. The fundamental difference is we were down. So obviously we finish games better when we're down, based on the playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"But that was what I was referring to, was managing leads better, playing all the way through to the end of the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,Welcome to Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. I'm excited to be here in New York City as the Liberty take on the Minnesota Lynx.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you all know, the Liberty and Lynx were the two best teams in the WNBA all year, with both at the top of the standings for much of the season. The Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, are making their second straight Finals appearance and looking to win their first WNBA championship. Obviously, they won the Commissioner's Cup the other year 2023. The Lynx, one of the most decorated franchises in WNBA history, are looking to win a league-record fifth title and are appearing in a record seventh Finals. They're looking to become the second team to sweep both the Commissioner's Cup and the WNBA Finals trophy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With Napheesa having such a career year, along with the play in New York with Sabrina and Stewie and the storylines about Leonie Fiebich, her first year in the league, All-Rookie Team, and free-agency signings in Minnesota with Courtney Williams and Alanna Smith and so many more storylines, I'm just excited to get this tipped off."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Finals mark the culmination of what I think is the most transformational year in the WNBA's history. You saw all the statistics we put out viewership, attendance, merch sales, digital engagement at or near record levels. To put it in perspective with a few stats that bring insight into what has happened, the WNBA has significantly outpaced the industry in average consumption of live games in 2024. Fans watched 30 percent more minutes on average of each WNBA game in the 2024 regular season."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our games reached a record 54 million viewers in the 2024 regular season. Younger, more diverse audiences are imperative to the growth of the sports industry, and they flocked to the WNBA this season. Viewership by fans under 35 increased 211 percent, led by a 259 percent increase in viewership from Gen Z and millennial women."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our focus on our direct-to-consumer platforms led to record-breaking content consumption and repeated fan engagement. WNBA App downloads surpassed 1 million this year, and monthly active users skyrocketed 252 percent. Social engagement increased nearly 300 percent across all of our league channels. There was an astounding 872 percent increase in WNBA App story views, which I know I watch my kids watching all the little stories that we put out there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Last time we gathered for the Finals, in 2023, we had just announced the Golden State expansion franchise. Since then, we have announced two more expansion teams to begin play in 2026, Toronto and Portland, with one more team to begin play by no later than the 2028 season, to get us to 16 teams."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This summer we signed a groundbreaking media rights deal that will grow the economics of our league and expand the reach and accessibility of our game for our fans, with additional WNBA media deals to come."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you know, early in the season, after seeing the growth trajectory we were on and with a challenging game footprint given the Olympics, we implemented full charter flights for the entire season plus playoffs."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This growth has not come without growing pains. The hateful speech and threats directed at our players are troubling. That type of conduct is not representative of the WNBA's character or fan base. As a league, we stand united in condemning racism and all forms of hate. The WNBA is one of the most inclusive and diverse professional sports leagues in the world, and we will continue to champion those values."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll meet with the Players Association, the players, teams. We'll work together to expand and enhance our efforts and are going to approach this multidimensionally, utilizing technology, prioritizing mental health, reinforcing physical security and increasing monitoring. We know there's more work to be done, and as a league, we are fully committed to listening to the players and other stakeholders on this and other important issues."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Finally, before we get to your questions, we have some news to announce Starting next year with the 2025 WNBA season, the WNBA Finals presented by YouTube TV will be a best-of-seven format, replacing the current best-of-five format. The Finals will take on a 2-2-1-1-1 structure, in which the team with the higher seed will host Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, and its opponent will host Games 3, 4 and 6. This will give our fans a championship series format that they are accustomed to seeing in other sports."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We will also be changing our first round to a 1-1-1 setup for the best-of-three series. We have contemplated both these changes since the pandemic. We would have done it in the current year, but with the Olympic break this year, it wasn't possible. But now that we have charters throughout the season and playoffs, it's feasible. So to summarize, in 2025 we will have a best-of-three first round, five in the semifinals and seven in the WNBA Finals."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"In addition, the 2025 regular season will increase from 40 to 44 games per team. Honestly, the league's growth and increased demand for WNBA basketball made this the ideal time to expand the schedule, lengthen the Finals and provide fans more opportunities to see the best players in the world compete at the highest level."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I also want to take the opportunity to let you know that the WNBA Draft Lottery 2025 presented by State Farm will be broadcast on Sunday, November 17, at 5 p.m. Eastern on ESPN."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, I want to thank you for your coverage this year. It really has made a difference. I really am very grateful to be standing here as the commissioner of a league that has been through so much. To have you all in this room and reporting on this league as you have all year, very grateful for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, happy to answer any questions."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, first of all, there's no place in sports for this. Just continue to condemn it, continue to be a voice on this. Also, I think we have been already meeting with some technology providers. I think there are some technology solutions out there that we could deploy and employ. Of course, we want to meet with the players and see what they want to do around that. But there are some technology companies we've been meeting with to see what we can do. It just is something where we have to continue to be a voice for this, a voice against it, condemning it, and making sure that we find every opportunity to support our players, who have been dealing with this for much longer than this year, by the way. I think Sue Bird said that the other day very eloquently. We need to continue to see how we can support the mental health resources, physical security, cybersecurity."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're going to attack it, as I said, multidimensionally. We're going to try to figure out how we can best work with the players as to how they want us to help solve this issue."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, well, next year we do not have any international competition. No FIBA World Cup and no Olympic break, so we should have a nice footprint. It's hard to start much earlier because we obviously have the college season. The college draft is such a great feeder system into the WNBA and creates a lot of excitement, as you've seen over the past few years and probably since the league started."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think probably not starting much earlier. Certainly we're well into October by the time we finish the Finals, especially if we go to five games this year, next year seven. So we'll probably go a little bit later in October."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But again, we'll have a decent footprint next year to fit in the 44. Remember, we have an additional team joining next year, in Golden State Valkyries. So I think it'll be great. We'll have obviously the condensed Commissioner's Cup a few weeks, culminating in that championship, as well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think next year will be a good footprint. We'll have to look at the following year because that is the FIBA World Cup year. Obviously, we'll be good in 2027, and then it'll be LA '28. It's a constant balancing of the schedule. I think we feel very good about where we'll be next year, for sure, on the footprint."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So that date in November was draft lottery, not the draft. Yes."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Golden State Valkyries will pick fifth in each round. The lottery picks will be the four teams that you probably have already done the calculations on, but we'll obviously put a release out after this press conference on exactly that, and then the Golden State Valkyries will have the fifth pick in each round."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's a good question on what's next as it relates to our globalization platform. Obviously, we played Toronto, we played in Edmonton. That was kind of our Canada series. Now we'll have a team in Toronto starting in '26. Sure, we'd like to play in more places -- EMEA, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America, I know Mexico City has shown interest, as well as a variety of other cities across the world."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, I was in Paris for the Olympics this year. Thought it was amazing, the support for women's basketball there. I'll never forget on the Friday night when Belgium played France in the women's game. I'd say that was the best crowd that I saw watch a game there. Obviously, a lot of Belgians could drive there to Paris."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It was great to see the growth of the game globally. I think our players represent such great role models to those communities in lifting women. I've admired what the NBA has done with their Global Games platform, playing around the world. I think we'll be on a path there as we get into 2025 and beyond."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That will be something I'm sure in collective bargaining that we'll sit down with the players and Players Association. I think one thing that you noticed in the last year or two, particularly this year, a lot of our veterans were in camp, training camp. Obviously, they have to show up by May 1, and I think it was important. I think you saw the quality of the game in the first few weeks because of that. I also think you saw the quality of the Commissioner's Cup play, which is toward the front half of the season to give that some more relevance. Again, I'm sure it'll be something we continue to discuss and talk about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so again, we work with FIBA. We're working with all the constituents on how we can make this all work, where they can have vibrant, competitive seasons. We can have our vibrant, competitive season."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, some have moved their dates to end earlier to make sure that those vets -- remember, our prioritization rule does not apply to rookies in their first couple years, but for those vets to come over and play in the best league in the world."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But we have a good relationship with FIBA. Working through with them. And again, I think in 2025 -- that's another impediment to starting earlier, to the question about starting earlier, not only the college draft and college season going into the beginning of April, we need to have a training camp, but also the Euro leagues, as well, play into April now, into May."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think on balance, I think we all want to grow the game globally. I think it's going to come down to footprints and seasons and how we can do it, which is why most of what we're doing in expanding our season will be on the back end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, absolutely. We're always scenario planning around a variety of different outcomes. Certainly, I engage with Nneka and Terri throughout the year, every month, every other week during the season. I really respect the player leadership. I think this is going to be an opportunity to listen to one another and take this league to the next level for generations to come."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We actually look forward to engaging in that now that we've kind of gotten the media deal we discussed, corporate partners, just everything. There's virtually not a sporting event you can turn on where one of our players is not in an ad spot. That was not happening five years ago. Look at Aliyah Boston and Sabrina and A'ja and so many of our players in these ad spots. I think that's a good sign, too, as we think about the future of this game and the future of the agreement between the Players Association and the owners."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, one thing that as a very long-term sports fan I know is that officiating and refereeing is always at the top of the fan's list, of the media's list. Obviously, we work hard on training. We work hard on consistency. Obviously, not every -- they're humans."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Looking at technology, basketball is a little more complex than tennis, for instance, around technology, of officiating. We're looking at a variety of different dimensions, but we'll continue training. We have a lot of veteran officials. You'll see them out here working the Finals. But we always know there's always work to do, always get better. We review in our Competition Committee meetings, officiating and points of emphasis and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll caucus with Bethany Donaphin, our head of league operations, and our referee operations, as well. We'll caucus to make sure we're putting out the best officiating we can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But I know it's a passionate issue. Every fan group -- I love when I go into market and every fan group I meet with, they usually wait and ask it as the last question of the night. But they do ask about officiating, which I appreciate the passion for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So on your first question, we do hear from NBA players who are very interested in investing in WNBA teams. There's a lot of capital inflow coming into women's sports, as many of you are hearing and reading, and obviously we were one of the first and only to raise at the scale we did, 75 million back in 2022. We brought in former NBA players into that capital raise and former WNBA players into that capital raise. So yes, we do get interest from time to time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now, the NBA investments by those players is in independent teams, not in NBA-affiliated teams. So if you're still playing for an NBA team, you probably want to invest in the WNBA team with your affiliate, and you can't do that until you graduate, I'll call it, or retire from basketball. So we have a lot of interest from that perspective."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Then again, we want to listen to the players as to how they want to think about anything that we go to the bargaining table on, whether that's equity stakes or other issues that they might be interested in. We're certainly willing to listen. I think it is complicated when you have a Players Association versus the league versus the owners who are all small businesses, right. Well, 13, now we'll have 15 to 16, and they're each individual businesses. I think it's a little more complicated because there's no one equity stake. Like Unrivaled, it is one league with equity stake in, and it's not teams. We've got 12, soon to be 16, teams in a league. So it's a little more complicated, I think."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that we look at for all of our teams every year, as well as you mentioned the expansion teams. I think my comments on the expansion teams were you want to make sure the expansion owners know, when you come into the league, it's a competitive league. Free agency is competitive now, and all of our owners are investing. You see investing in practice facilities and other player experiences. I think we want those expansion teams to come in and be the most successful they can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, you may have a different view, but I think our current owners are all growing in the same direction as far as how they know they need to get free agents to build a championship squad. Obviously great rookies, too, become veterans later on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I don't have a bias against any one team. Obviously, we have teams playing in different size arenas. You saw some teams upgrade those arenas for certain games this year, and I thought that was a sign and signal that as has attendance had a grown across the league that we can play in bigger arenas. I think when I came into this league, someone said you should all be playing in 5,000-seat arenas. Can you imagine what you're going to see out here tonight if that was in a 5,000-seat arena? No, there's going 17,000-plus people here. And we had our highest-attended game ever, over 20,000, in Washington this year."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we do have standards, by the way, across the board for facilities, practice facilities and things like that. The owners now know that there's an edge to showing a player investment in the things like facilities, et cetera, especially practice facilities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I was in Phoenix for the All-Star Game this year taking a tour of their new practice facilities that they opened. Vegas has done it, Seattle has done it, Dallas is going to do it. I think Phoenix I mentioned, and Chicago is looking at upgrading. I think all of our -- we already had some great practice facilities already in the league in Indy, Minnesota, et cetera, and here in New York."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, again, there's no -- we do have standards, but there's nothing where we're saying any one owner is not up to their standards today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so just in general for the 16th spot, as I've mentioned, the good news is we have a lot of demand from many cities. I'd say 10 or so, maybe even plus at this point, because I think the more people are watching the WNBA and seeing what we're growing here and seeing these players and the product on the court, more people are interested in having it in their cities. They see the economic impact of having a WNBA team in their city, the role model in the community these players represent."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I've said Philly is on the list, and Philly is on the list. Now that we have the three teams, two in '26, one next year, we're not in a huge rush. We'd like to bring it in in '27 or no later than '28, as I mentioned. So I'd say there's 10 to 12 cities that are very viable that we're evaluating, and we have a process. I'd say I don't have a deadline by which we have to name it because it'll be out to '27 or '28, but I would think in the next couple months or so we'll start -- now as we get into the offseason, we'll start taking a look at those that will go to the top of the list through our process."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, it's all the same types of things I've been talking about for the other three around arena, practice facility, player experience, committed long-term ownership group, city, demographics, psychographics, Fortune 500 companies based there. All the things we've been looking at in all of our cities and our data analysis. And then we've built some good relationships with some of the potential cities as they've started to engage with the league on an expansion team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think if you look at the diversity of when we did our capital raise, you'll see a fair amount of diversity in the ownership group we brought in there, investor group."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, we talk with our owners all the time about diversity in the coaching ranks, in their front office, back office, et cetera. You see every year we score very well in our report on that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We have a lot of assistant coaches that have been previous WNBA players and represent a very diverse group, as well. We have all of our owners partnering with minority-owned businesses. We partner at the league with Mielle, who is one of our newer partners. Playa Society. I think one of our teams just got a Partake Foods jersey patch that's a minority-owned business."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're looking at it from all these angles, partnerships, ranks of our employee base and certainly the coaching diversity and coaching, as well. So it is important to us. There's not a Board of Governors meeting that we don't talk about this. As you know, we've made enormous progress especially in the assistant coaching ranks with former WNBA players by essentially focusing on this over the last couple years. Made enormous progress, which is why our report card is really good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But it's something that you can never rest on, so I appreciate the question. We've had a couple coaches exit, so I think we have three open coaching spots. Obviously, the Golden State Valkyries announced their first head coach in their franchise history today. We have three open coaching spots. So we'll certainly be looking for our owners to have a diverse pool of candidates, and ultimately they'll make the decision on their head coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"But I think that this is a series. We wanted to really win, obviously, for home court. But the beauty is, we have another game on Sunday and we'll be ready."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, it's probably a lot of things. I could probably give you a better answer tomorrow. I just thought we went away from our principles of play. I think we had a great first quarter, and then they lifted up the energy and they outhustled us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think we forced some of the action. We weren't moving it good enough. We couldn't get downhill as much. You know, we missed a lot of shots. We missed a lot of shots."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Just the principles of play for us. How we want to play, get to the next action."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But look, defensively, I think they executed better than us. That's what it came down to. They executed better than us. They found a way to win. They made some big shots, timely shots when they needed to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,We're disappointed. We have to be better. We're a better team than what we showed today.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think it's pretty clear, JJ had an amazing game, and the way that she was aggressive from start to finish is exactly what we need."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we got a lot of looks. Like, 90 shots is a lot, and we missed them. I think just coming out and understanding the game plan a little bit better, and always being on our front foot. I felt like there was just a few situations, time and score toward the end of the game, that really hurt us. But collectively there's a lot of things that you could kind of look at and be like, well, this is one of the reasons why we lost."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they took us out of what we wanted to run. They were really aggressive. They were blowing up stuff. We couldn't get clear passes. We tried to go downhill and they would stunt and get back, and we just got a little bit stagnant. Then we had obviously -- I thought we were slow. We were up so you're trying to move the ball, but then we are slow in our speed, execution speed, and then it was making it easy for them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And they made plays. They made plays down the other end. Obviously we contested it -- we give them a three, a four-point play. Those things, they can break your back, and they did. We had our opportunities to win and we didn't finish it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We're disappointed. We have to go back to work. We have to freshen up. We have to look at how we can be better, and it's really just principles of play. Things that we have been great at all season long, we have to just refocus on them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"I think the missed free throw because we had an opportunity to go up one. But even still, at the end of overtime, I had probably one of my cleanest looks. Didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"I mean, they switched with us a little bit more to stop us from going downhill. I don't know, I think the weight of the game was more about us, like Sandy said, getting away from our principles versus what they did to kind of get us out of rhythm."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they were throwing different coverages at her, with the switching and she was trying to go probably a little bit too much one-on-one early. We've just got to move the ball and trust that the ball will come back to her in that regard and exploit it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We had a tough night. We had a tough shooting night. We all did. But what I know, Sabrina is a competitor. She'll get ready for Game 2 and come back strong."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I want to be taking these shots. I feel like knowing my teammates and that everyone has confidence in me is important. It's kind of like on to the next and still making sure I'm aggressive any time on the court. Obviously as a player, it's very frustrating. But bounce back for Game 2."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"It was a point of emphasis for us coming into the game, just to control the rebounding and really get on the boards and try to exploit them in that way. It's something that we're going to have to continue to do to be successful."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,JONQUEL JONES,"But like Stewie and Coach said, we had a lot of opportunities to close the game out. A few things that we have to change and kind of be aware of moving forward, but still some things to build upon and things to learn from."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, a hundred percent. It's principles of plays at both ends. Being at the point of the screen, Kayla McBride is coming off and shooting it, and then letting them go downhill, pressuring and letting Hiedeman dribble by us and giving them too many easy looks where we should have been just a little bit smarter in our defense there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,Sometimes when we didn't rebound or we kind of -- we went to offensive rebound but we are out of position and they got easy layups in transition. So those really break your back.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Principles of play in the half court. Pace is there, but I think we got a little stagnant and a little tired. But credit to them. They were blowing us up and they were being really physical. They were very active. They were switching it, and then that took us out of it a little bit. We've got to be better and we will be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think it's, specifically to that play because they were reviewing the time, you're just focusing on making the shot. Making the first one. Making the first one. Making the first one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"And then the second one, the same. It's when you want to be thinking about nothing else. It definitely sucks to miss."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,I think just the start we did have. We put up 32 points. We were very intentional playing defense. We were making it really hard for them to score. Some easy baskets. We were making shots and moving the ball really quick.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely a little bit anxious. A little bit nervousness in there, just because I had no idea where I was going. I kind of told my agent to keep it a secret from me. I just want to be surprised."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"For me, I just wanted to land somewhere that would develop me and kind of make me into the best basketball that I can be. I'm happy that I landed with Utah. Definitely excited. Felt relief when I heard my name called, so that's probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think the biggest way I fit in is just my versatility. When you come in at such a young age, and being able to play multiple positions and guard multiple positions, I really feel like that allows you to fit in with the dynamic of the team just because you can do so much and fit in with different needs. That's the biggest part."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,There's a lot of talented guys on that team. I could go down the list and do their whole lineup that I can fit in with. But the biggest thing is they are young and I could develop and learn with them and kind of build that young core. That's probably the part I'm most excited about with this team.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Just being himself really. I feel like that's how he differentiates himself on and off the court and really made a name for himself. Being himself includes not only his personality but also his work ethic and how hard he worked to get to where he is and where he is going to continue to go to.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I feel like just taking those aspects of his game and his mentality, how he approached every workout, every rep, every charity event, every media coverage, I feel like I can use that and take that with me and use it throughout my career. That's how I'm going to grow and develop."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"It's something we dreamed about. As kids, obviously we never really got to play against or with each other on the same team just because of the age difference. So I think being able to do that now is definitely a dream come true. I'm going to make sure I'm matched up on him when we're playing them. Make sure, tell Will, put me on Jalen Williams. That's the game plan."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I think it just goes to show the type of parents I have and the type of people I have in my life and my family members, just the values they installed in both of us. That's why we ended up this way. So I know they are extremely proud watching us reach our dreams. That's the biggest thing for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"We practiced it a lot, I'm not going to lie. Two years ago, we messed it up. We were practicing for a few days, maybe even a week up until this point, to make sure we nailed it. Add a little flair to it. So we made up for it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I've just got baby steps into the fashion industry, I'm not going to lie to you. This is the first time I stepped out and wore something expensive. I think for me it might be something a little hobby I'll pick up, but I'm just starting to get into fashion and just starting to figure it out. I'll probably learn from him as I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, it's hard to say just because we play two different styles of basketball. I don't know what your definition of better is. I hope to become an elite two-way player, playing offense and defense and doing that at the highest level and being one of those elite two-way players in the NBA, as I go throughout my career."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, I strive to be better than him. Obviously a little sibling rivalry, but we also play like completely different just with the way our bodies are built. So you know, that's the answer you're looking for."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely gaming. I would say gaming, for sure, is one of the biggest ones. Fashion, stepping into it a little bit."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I'm a huge movie guy. That's something I always been into. Just pick up a movie and watch it. I love cinematography, so that's definitely probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I like bowling and starting to pick up golf too. Have a lot more free time, so I can start getting good at golf and getting a routine for it. But definitely bowling is another activity I'm heavy on."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, probably. And a lot of family time. That's probably going to be a heavy dose of it, spend as much time as I can with friends and family, while also obviously staying locked in on basketball. But enjoying the moments with them before the season gets hectic and I'm going to be traveling all over the place."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, go to this afterparty. That's probably the biggest thing. I'm looking forward to enjoying that. Got all my closest friends and family there. I guess that's on my bucket list to enjoy."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"It was a surreal feeling. I mean, especially just sitting in that chair waiting, just to figure out which team was going to get me. For them to pick me, a lot of emotions were just going through me. I'm definitely blessed."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"All of them are hardworking. They push their players past their limits. I feel like that's the best place for me. Especially with me going there, I know they are going to push me past my limits, push me past that wall to be the best player that I can be and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"Well, like you said, they have their trust in Bam. So I feel like once they have trust with me, it comes with me showing them that in practice. I feel like that's something that would elevate my game, just having that trust in me that I go out and make the right plays."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,KEL'EL WARE,"A lot of people go into the transfer portal for money. I went in there for the right fit and I found the right fit. That definitely helped my career. Going into my sophomore season, actually getting to know the coaches. Just learning more things about the team just before I made the decision."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,I've got to go with Drake. OVO. OVO.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"I've never been to Toronto. I've never even been to Canada. But I know that it's a nice city in Canada, and all I really know is the building."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, the guards, we're a close group at Baylor. Every year, there's six guards. Y'all are competing against each other every day. Y'all are getting better watching a lot of film. We actually do call it Guard U."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,Me being the next one out is a blessing from God. I'm just super grateful to be in this position and I hope that I'm going to represent Baylor well.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, just excited to meet all the players and to speak to the coaches, to meet them, meet the front office. Just excited to go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, they are very incredible and talented. I'll try to fit in there. I'm young. I'll learn a lot probably. I'm really grateful for the opportunity."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"I did not visit Oklahoma. Every organization that I've been to, I met some really nice people. That is with Oklahoma, also. Very, very nice coach. GMs, everybody, I'm just excited to meet them in person and talk to them. And yeah, that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, it was great. But I had injuries, so sadly, I didn't play more. But I tried to take my time and to be with them, to talk with them, even with the injury."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"So yeah, I really enjoyed it there. I made some really good friends and friendships forever. But as I said, I'm sad that I didn't have that opportunity to play more with them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Just that I'm ready, that I'll give 150 percent of myself for every ball, every possession, every time on defense. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, I talked with Micic. He just told me everything the best about not just the Thunder, but the whole NBA. And of course, Durisic, Nikola and I got really close this year. I really enjoyed playing with him. It was easy, as I can say. I hope he will get drafted as high as possible."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,It meant a lot that I had him here. We were together in Miami. We shared some good memories at times. We visit some places. It's great to have him here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Not yet. I've been coming back slowly. But we'll talk tomorrow with the team and the team doctor and see what's the best for me, and we'll do that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"Nikola is one of the most popular names in Serbia. So yeah, maybe. There's a lot of Nikolas, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"That I'm really funny person. That I want to spend time with my friends. At home with my family, we have movie nights. We enjoy watching movies and TV series."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"It was unbelievable. It was a dream come true. It's something that I've been dreaming of since I've been a little kid. Having my family with me at the table, my coach, my agent, having my family in the crowd, I couldn't ask for anything else. It was my mom's birthday today, so that's an awesome thing to celebrate as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,I'm at a loss for words. I'm super happy to be here and super thankful.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I never had a baseball team because there was no baseball team close to Kentucky, but I think I'm going to be an Astros fan now."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited. They have a really good thing going in Houston. The coach is really good. Like you said, Jalen. They have a bunch of really young, athletic guys, and we'll be able to play fast. It's going to be fun."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"I'm super excited to get out there and learn and take it all in, so I can't wait."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is just going in and learning. You have guys like Fred VanVleet that I'll be able to learn from. Just going in with an open mind, ready to learn, ready to do whatever it takes to win. Just compete and go in and have fun and continue to get in the gym and work on everything that I need to work on."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,I'm super excited. I can't wait to get to Houston and get the thing started.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,REED SHEPPARD,"He didn't say that, but now that you say that, that is pretty good that that's a thing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,Thank you.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,It just shows the amount of talent that we have in France. I'm really excited for Zacc. I think our national team is really going to be good.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,I was really happy for him. I kind of had a feeling. I was really happy for him.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"And me, I was really happy for me, too."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"I have some family and friends in town, so I'll definitely spend some time with them later today."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Yeah, I think it's really special. Any pick that you get picked, you know the team is taking a chance on me and I'm really blessed for that and I won't take it for granted."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"Yeah, it helped a lot. My dad, he always loved basketball and he looked at basketball -- he never was happy after one of my games. He always had something to say for me to improve on it. I think that's what made me and my brother good players. I can't thank them enough for this."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ALEX SARR,"I mean, I think it's just a first step, but it's definitely achieving something that was big for me. You know, being drafted, I don't take it for granted and I'm sure enjoying it a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"Yes, we want the best version possible. I would say it's natural. We are like that. We work hard. We have a lot of energy. We want to be the best. For sure, we are going to continue to be like that."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I think the basketball in France has improved, and that's why we are here in this draft. Three French players in the top 10, it's not nothing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I know Zaccharie because I've played against him since I was 15. He played against me when I was at Cholet and him at ASVEL. Alex, I don't really know him."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I'm going to share a lot of moments with my family, with my friends, and after, we will see. I don't really know what I'm going to do."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,TIDJANE SALAUN,"I know a lot of French players have played with this team in Charlotte. I'm the next one. I will bring all my fire to the club and be ready to play with some players, like you say, LaMelo Ball. Some alley-oops, yeah. I'm ready to jump and put the ball in the rim."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I had a workout a couple weeks ago. I really enjoyed the time that I spent with them trying to understand their philosophy. As soon as we were talking, kind of understand more about the organization."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Just start to present myself and told them what I was ready to do for them. I was saying that I wanted to contribute to -- I want to be a part of a winning team and contribute to winning and compete. For that, I say that I was ready to do whatever it takes to do it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Basically my versatility could be -- defensively in this league is really important. Trying to guard multiple positions, trying to be aggressive. I will know more soon, but now that's what I've got to say right now."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"That's amazing. We are trying to represent our country, and I'm so glad to be a part of it. There is more players coming in. I'm really proud of being a part of the success of my country. Trying to understand what Victor, Rudy or other French players really help me to develop myself as a player, first of all, in France, and hopefully now in the NBA."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,I'm not shocked. I'm not shocked. I've known Tidjane and Alex for a long time. We grew up playing against each other. So I know them really well.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"Like I said, that's amazing for our country. That's amazing for us, first of all. Just to be able to realize our dream together is special. I feel like French players are going to take some inspiration, and that's going to be better and better for us. I really feel lucky because there's so many young players that are good. That's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I'm a versatile player. I feel like I can fit easily into this team. I can't wait to figure out what is going to be my role or my goals, or, you know, just to make sure we win games."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"So I don't know yet, but I know that I can do a lot of things. Defend multiple positions, grabbing some rebounds, finishing strong, being aggressive, shooting threes obviously. I think that's going to be -- that's a part of my game. That's something that I need to keep it up for helping the team to win the next season, because I know that we are going to have to shoot the ball. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"For now, I just want -- I just know the facilities of the Hawks. I can't wait to get in there and to just work in those conditions. I think that's a style of life that I'm not used to. I talk about the gym, the cold baths, locker room, whatever. I feel like if I could basically sleep in the gym. In Bourg-en-Bresse, which is a great gym, too, but not as good as the Hawks have. I can really sleep in the gym."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"The workout went well. It was probably one of my favorite ones, actually. I just really liked the coaching staff and the organization in general. I had an opportunity to spend time with them, and just being able to talk with them and interact with them. They just talked about the plan and what they are thinking about next year, and then what they are looking for in a big."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"And then obviously the workout, they gave me some advice on how to get better. I just love the organization, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"I haven't been playing basketball that long. I'm still learning each and every day, every time I step on the court."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"Obviously, I wasn't ranked and it wasn't something I was paying attention to. To be honest, I was trying to have fun on the court. Obviously, brought me from Cameroon all the way to here. You never know where the basketball can take you. Just being here is amazing. It's a blessing and I have to thank God to be able to put me in this position."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,YVES MISSI,"Oh, for sure. According to everyone, they have the best food in the U.S. I remember going on my visit, I really liked it. I can't wait to get to know them a little bit more and just spend time with them on the team and just get to work, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Not really. I feel like my game is dissected very much so, whether it's being non-athletic, non-defender. So it's something I take as a challenge. I'm used to it by now, going to the biggest platform at Duke. You get used to it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,I'm just excited to embrace the challenge and embrace the process and have fun with it. It's a blessing to even be here.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm just excited to learn from him, learn from both Maxey and him. Obviously they are elite scorers, so I think I can space the floor and create space for them. I'm excited to get to know them and learn as much as possible from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm excited. Obviously Maxey, I've heard great things about him. Watching him on the court, he's an elite player. Being able to play alongside him and learn from him. On draft night, there's surprises everywhere. So I didn't know where I was going. I tried not to get attached to any teams. So yeah, I guess it is a surprise, but I'm happy to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Not yet. I sent Maxey my number, and I got to talk to the GM, the coach. Not too much. But I'm excited to get to know them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I think it's my natural emotion, is just to be happy, be joyful. So there's no reason to change that when I'm on the court. I'm always going to embrace the challenge, obviously, but I'm going to have fun with it. Whether I make a three, make a good play, the team is excited, the crowd is excited. I'm going to be smiling probably no matter what. So it's something I bring everywhere I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,DALTON KNECHT,"I'd say my why is I feel like I've been underrated my whole entire life ever since I was coming out of high school. I've always had a chip on my shoulder, and to this day I'll always have that chip on my shoulder to go out there and prove people wrong."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"My conversations were great with T Spoon. As you know, she was coached by Coach Mulkey, so I kind of thought maybe I'll go there. Knowing like the conversations were so good and she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a Black woman and as a head coach, and everything she's done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Obviously, I know how my size is an advantage. So I don't want to get too much into staying on the perimeter. I want to be able to mix it up and always keep the defense off balance. That's something that I think me, my coaches, we always try to balance and work on is how much I'm handling, how much I'm inside and just trying to find that perfect balance."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,SANDY BRONDELLO,But they went to another level. So they kind of took us out of a rhythm. Not surprised us. We knew what they are capable of doing. But we've got to get back and just play Liberty basketball.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"Just like our 2016 championship that was lost -- officiating, missing a shot clock violation. This sucks. This is for a championship for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams. This isn't that hard."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Trying to manage everybody, trying to protect yourself and not get injured and take away from what you ultimately want to accomplish, I think is something we prioritize. But it's a lot that goes on when you come here for this game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,BREANNA STEWART,"We just take it on the chin, you know. We were up a lot and then we had a wild kind of sequence to end the fourth. Didn't start overtime great. I had a great look at the end and I didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,"So I tell these guys, for whatever reason, it didn't work out. It just doesn't feel right that you lose a series with that level of discrepancy. We don't have a team that whines and complains and all that stuff. Sometimes it probably hurts us. Maybe being a little more, I don't know, something. But you have a star player like Phee, that just, I don't get it. I don't get how she can be held and go to the basket and get hit, and then a marginal, at best, at best, sends their best player to the free throw line. I mean, that's tough. It's tough to swallow."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,PACOME DADIET,"Yeah, it's kind of crazy. I played with everybody. It's nice seeing your country being one of the most represented in the NBA. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of everybody. The French people that went to the NBA, it's big. It's coming from a different continent. We have to really work to get there. Yeah, I'm really proud of everybody."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, so obviously one of our focuses this year of our social justice council is reproductive rights, as well as civic engagement, given that we're in a general election year. So the one thing I like about our players, our players want to be engaged. They don't run away from things. They want to be engaged and they want to force change in the communities in which they live and work, and they do it very, very effectively. I think on this issue they'll continue to do that effectively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,BREANNA STEWART,"But if they are not falling, they are not falling. I'm not going to let that affect the way I do things. So continuing to be there for my team. I didn't talk about this, but before I made the free throws, I missed two free throws. I was like, no, I can't do this again, I can't. I have to be here. Olaf Lange, him and I have talked about being a python, where it's like you know your moment when to strike. At that moment, I was just thinking about being a python."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I got really emotional because the main goal was to get here and being able to give my family a better life, and just by looking at them and seeing them at my table was amazing. I obviously get emotional when I talk about my family because I'm so proud of everything I was able to accomplish and do for them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 10,CHERYL REEVE,"No, it is the margin. It is the margin. But I hear what you're saying, in that when it mattered, we got some hustle plays. And we always say, you never know which one is going to be the difference between winning and losing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, I think the more I develop, I'll definitely be able to initiate offense at the one. Played two and three before. I think playing in the NBA, playing around in practice, I think I'll start to get used to it more, and then I think I can really take that role to the next level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,NIKOLA TOPIC,"He just told me, ""Welcome, teammate."" That means a lot for me because he accepted me. He stood up to shake my hand. It's really great to have him there. He's coming into the third year, and he's done a really good job the past two. And not just him, the players and the whole organization. I think we can do more."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,CHERYL REEVE,It's a shame that officiating had such a hand in a series like this. Obviously there's always going to be a team that's going to be a little more disappointed than the other.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 20,THE MODERATOR,"There's no practice tomorrow, so...."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,CHET HOLMGREN,"It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,Be patient. You've got to be patient. They're not always going to do things that you like. Be patient because they're kids. I think that's the most important thing.
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think 200 is a lot to be scored. It just shows that we didn't go out there and compete like I guess you would want us to or whoever would want us to. But I think that's just what it is. Guys are talented. Make a lot of shots. We hit a lot of threes, and that was it."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,February 16,TREY MURPHY III,"Always. That was always my motto. Just be patient and be myself and continue to work hard every single day. That's the best way to do it because if you don't, you try to rush the process, things aren't going to go your way."
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,February 17,SHAI GILGEOUS-ALEXANDER,"To this point, it's not any harder, because I've grown through it being hard, I think, in the past."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Lastly, I have been very reflective over the past couple weeks with all the hype and talk about this draft class and the WNBA. Surviving the existential time of the WNBA wubble, raising that 75 million in capital in February of 2022 as the first women's sports league to do so at that scale, deploying it against our key priorities. Almost as if we knew we had to be ready for this moment, and we are."
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,February 18,KEVIN DURANT,"It's always been that way with NBA, and since the social media era, you see more and more of that. I think guys in the past have stood up for what they believe in, social issues in the league, and that's given us the confidence to go out and do it as well in this generation."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that expletive timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it."
