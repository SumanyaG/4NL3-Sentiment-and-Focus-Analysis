2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, was it the first or second quarter? He just went on a run where he just, he hit the three, hit the middy, then ran back, got the block at the rim in transition. He was just making play after play and it was just like, all right, he's back, there was no question about it then. We need some more that have going forward for the rest of this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,They're two of the most talented guards this league has seen. It's going to be a challenge for all of us. It's not going to be one-on-one we all have to participate.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,They're two of the best this league has ever seen. It's going to be a lot of fun. Just have to embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,Pray they miss laughter. They're special. They make tough shots. You just got to try to make it difficult for them for 48 minutes and embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"You got to know the personnel. You're just competing. We've been switching a lot all year. Whoever has that challenge, just got to know that it's not just you on an island we're all going to be there behind them. Just embracing that challenge, competing and trying to make it as difficult as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, obviously there's a lot of history between the two. I think once we get in between the lines and the game starts, it's just going to be a competitive game. We're just going to go out there and compete. I know he's going to do the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think at the time we didn't have anybody who had any Finals experience. So obviously we've learned a lot from that Finals a couple years ago. Obviously adding KP and Jrue, all the experience they have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"I think it's going to be different. Everybody is looking forward to it and embracing the challenge. This is the NBA Finals, it's what you dream about. It's going to be a challenge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"I think everybody's excited, honestly. It's been a long break. A good week of practice. Everybody is looking forward to it. Like I said, this is what you dream about. Whatever it takes we got to be willing to do. We've been working for this moment the whole season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,Yeah. It's going to be here tomorrow. It's going to be fun. There's going to be a lot going on. A big challenge and have fun with it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"We didn't want to skip any steps the whole season. Obviously, the outside noise is going to be there no matter what we do. So this whole year we didn't want to skip steps. I think we did a really good job of that in the regular season and the postseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"Just continue to take it one day at a time, one game at a time. Just understand there are going to be ups, there's going to be downs. Just embrace it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, you're here, you see all the banners, all the history. It's in our practice facility. You just dream about being part of that. Obviously the great history that the Celtics have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,I think we all just embraced it and are thankful and grateful to be a part of this organization.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERRICK WHITE,"This is what it's all about here in Boston, this stage, this moment. We understand the challenges of it. We're just looking forward to it. We're going to have fun. There's going to be ups, there's going to be downs. We may lose, but we got to go out there and compete each and every night. Whatever it takes to get four wins."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's crazy. This is like the biggest stage in basketball. To reach this point, have the opportunity to come out here and perform and help my team win the championship, it's an honor. Hopefully we can get it done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I would have the belief in myself that I could do it. I always dreamed of being in the NBA. I knew I worked really hard to make it. So I guess in a way, yeah, I believed in it. It's the only reason I would work every day like I did, I had the belief in that dream, so yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I wasn't here when Kyrie was here but there's no bad blood. I think a lot of the guys that played with him have admired the way he plays the game. I definitely admire it, too. I take a lot of things. The way he plays basketball is very beautiful. He's an unbelievable player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,There is no bad blood from us at all.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think it's the nature of Boston and the NBA. When a player leaves like that, fans and people can be frustrated. I think at this point we should just realize how good of a player he is and just give him his flowers for that aspect of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just helps that you've been through it. I think the difference this year, too, is we got a little bit more rest going into this series than the last time we were in the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Just kind of the circus with the NBA Finals, the media, everything that comes with it. So just going through it realizing what the routine is going to be like. That helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Just in the basketball game, I don't think it's any different necessarily than the playoff series we played before. Same thing, we getting up and down. Definitely helps, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think we have to realize they're unbelievable players, and we're going to try to make things very tough for them. You're never going to completely stop them. We're going to do our best."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,PAYTON PRITCHARD,"That's easy. The reason I fell in love with basketball in the first place is I watched Dwyane Wade win his first NBA Finals versus the Mavericks. I was really young at the time, I might have been seven, something like that. I can vividly remember watching them come back and how incredible he was that series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a huge moment. It's an honor. It's a blessing. It's one of those things you dream about, think about every preseason, every season, every postseason, every offseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"To be here now, it's something special. But just got to stay locked into the moment to be successful."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a special place to play, especially an NBA Finals. I know the energy is going to be insane. Their fan base is one of the best, for sure. They're going to support their team. We're going to feed off the energy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,There might have been a few moments when I dreamed of the future to come back here like this. It's cool to be back here. Back then was a whirlwind. I was trying to survive.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"He's a special player. Presence around the rim defensively, obviously can shoot from very deep. With his height, it's hard. Adds an element to those guys that we can definitely key in on and take into account. Scoring threat."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"As far as his time with us, we're going to compete. At the end of the day, we are good friends, have a good relationship. Looking forward to battling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,I'm not sure which story you're talking about.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Very brief. I think he's wearing the 77 very well. For a guy like him, I think it's very fitting to have a unique number. As one of the most unique players this league has seen, this game has seen, for him to have the number that kind of stands on its own, it's very fitting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Feeling good. It was a long road to get to this point for me. But feeling good. Looking forward to today's practice, moving around a little bit more, then being ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Of course, of course. Burns inside of me, you know, not being able to be out there. But tomorrow finally I'll get the chance and I'm excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, no, not cautious. I mean, no. I've came back from multiple injuries. I've had these first games back, of course not at this stage. At the end it's just basketball. Of course, the intensity is a little bit higher. I have to go out there and play like it's a basketball game, an important basketball game, and that's it. I don't need to think too much or, yeah, overthink. Just go out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, I'll play tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, it's good. It's always been good. Yeah, as I said, he's one of the best players in the league, in the world. It will be a tough challenge for us to try to stop him. Just following his career when he came in the league, already made a huge impact. I had the opportunity to play with him for a couple years, get to know him. Just knowing what type of person he is, what type of player he is, his mindset, he's a special player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,We have a big challenge ahead of us competing against somebody like that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no, I mean, I did everything, right? You have to check all the boxes to even get to this point. Of course, as I said, you cannot imitate the same intensity in practice as it's going to be tomorrow in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I have to feel confident to go out there and leave it all on the floor and expect that I'm going to be healthy and completely fine.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, obviously it's been tough. No, I've never felt like I'm not a part of this. I am a part of this. I've tried to be with the team, like, in any capacity I could. Guys so far have been, like, playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up. Al has been unbelievable for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I just look forward to add more to complete the mission."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's going to be goose bumps, for sure, especially not playing for a while, then coming back in this kind of environment. It's going to be special. Going to be goose bumps, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I'm really, really, really looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not all of it was, like, not good, right? We had some good moments. We had some decent moments. Yeah, overall I think it didn't work for both sides. It wasn't perfect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"But, like, I would say everything, teammates, locker room, I know at that time there were some rumors there's like something in the locker room. It was never like that. It's all just noise at the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It wasn't just perfect for us playing together, it didn't work out, that's it. We moved on. There's no, like, ill will from their side, for sure from my side. I don't think there should be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,Just didn't work out. But I have nothing but love for Dallas and for the teammates and for everybody there.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think he makes everyone's life easier. One, because of who he is as a person, the type of character he has. Your franchise player has to be a cornerstone of what you do. It starts with his high character, the way he carries himself, who he is as a dad, who he is as a teammate. His availability. He's there for every single practice, every single game. Loves being coached. Just carries himself the best way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,There's no one like him. He's great.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Right away. I think just all he cares about is winning. He's used the experiences he's had around the league. He's seen a lot, he's seen it all. He's seen success. He's seen tough times. He knows what the league is all about. I think at this point in his career, winning is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"But it's both sides, right? He had to do his part to fit in, but we had to do our part as a team, guys that have been here before, meet him where he's at because of his ability to play at such a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,So I think it was just both.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think it's more like the things that lead to success are the same. You're in locker rooms, regardless of the sport, even if you're in a company, everybody is saying the same thing. The things that go into winning, the things that go into success Toughness, togetherness, connectivity, the mindset you bring. It's all the same. It's just a matter of getting the right group of people in the right spots, then just working to feed that mentality every single day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,You can learn from anything and everything. You're trying to stay as open-minded as you can.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, every year he just has the open-mindedness to get better. So if you have that, you're naturally going to be different. But also, like, from the first time we were there, he's been through other stuff. He's been through success, we've been through failures, we've won, lost, had pain, triumph. You use the things you've been through every single year to make yourself better on and off the court. That's kind of where we're all at as a team, using those goods and bads to use us for where we are right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he can process information. He can process situational basketball. He has an awareness of what's going on on the court. He has innate ability to communicate that in real-time because of his ability to just kind of take that all in. Who has the ball, who has the matchup, where is the help, what's the spacing, who can you help off of, when can you make a play. He has great instincts. That allows him to communicate at all times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I would say this is not the end of the journey. The journey is for however long you're alive. This is just one piece to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,Regardless of what happens you got to wake up the next day and do your job. The journey will forever be there.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"You're just ready for it. You do everything within your control to prepare for it, mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. Tomorrow you just get after it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"The game, the environment will tell us what we need to focus on, what we need to get better on and what we need to do. The most important thing is staying on a even keel and staying with poise. I think that's something our team has done a good job of doing all year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I had a good seat, great perspective in that. I think the biggest thing you learn is what goes into winning in the NBA Finals is the same as the last series, series before that, regular season, preseason, practice, training camp. It's the details, the execution, the ability to take your mindset and your body to the next level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,The toughest team will win. The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"The biggest thing we took as we were going through that series against the Warriors, the things we kept coming back to were the things we kept talking about the entire year - the margins, details, fundamentals, the way you go about executing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's not the only moment that those guys are using to get better. The coolest thing about where Jaylen has been is his surrender to anything external and the most important thing is his growth and development as a person and as a player. That's all he cares about, is getting better. I think that's been really cool to see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,I think it's the same for Jayson. You can pick numerous experiences that everybody in our locker room has been through that you need to be able to use for the situation we're in now. That will remain the same for the rest of our careers.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"I think it's all about using what you've been through good, bad, indifferent, to help you in the present moment. The guys are doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, unless they change the light bulbs in the arenas, they won't be any brighter than they were the last series. It's just sticking to the details, the things that matter, the truth. The truth of the matter is if you don't box out, if you don't sprint back in transition, if you don't pass the ball in a two-on-one, if you don't take away the other team's tendencies, if you don't know who you're guarding, don't recognize the spacing, if you don't talk, if you don't play hard, you're not going to win. Focusing on the most simple things and the truth, the truth of the matter is you have to do those things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"You have to do them at a high level. Obviously the stakes are higher, that just means that the details are more important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, everybody in the organization is a leader in their own way. Everybody sets the temperature when they come in. Brad giving me my start, hiring me, empowering me from day one as an assistant, giving me some of the opportunities that he has. But also the way he carries himself. I've always had a lot of respect for how he went about coaching, how he kept family balance number one. How he treated people number one. That was always more important than whether there was a success or a failure. I think he spearheads the leadership, the temperature of the building, just as everybody else does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"A whole lot of trust, just a whole lot of communication. In life, you could think someone has your back, but you're never really going to know unless it happens in game play. You get blown by, you see your teammate putting his body on the line for you, makes you just want to do that much more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard not to, right? Got to be able to adapt to every situation you're putting yourself in. Whenever you're shooting, doing layup lines and stuff like that, you turn around, there's 150 people with cameras, all you got to do is just smile away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard to treat it like every other game because there's a level of urgency. We're more focused on each and every individual fact that we can, no matter if that's defensive coverages, offensive game plan, what we need to do to come out and throw the first punch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's definitely been a journey, man. I feel like it hasn't even been a year, but it feels like three. I feel like I've matured, I've grown up, and I've grown a lot as a person and as an individual."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding I'm going to get them into their spots. Whenever they have three people on them, you just got to understand put yourself in the ability where they can see you, and they going to get the ball to you because they're always going to draw two or two and a half people."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"It's just finding little holes in the defense and slowly being able to not be as aggressive but try to get them open so they can get you open, and you're going to get your shots. It's not always going to be me, people in the corner open, people at the top of the three that's open. Just be able to move the ball and find the right shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,It makes you play with a certain level of aggressiveness and freedom. You put your life on the line out there. You put your body and your soul on the line in this 94 feet so you can win a basketball game. We're talking about basketball. Are you going to go out on the court and be scared of anybody because it's a basketball game? No.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like there's a lot of things in life, a lot of fears in life that I've had to meet over this past year, and it's caused me to be that much more confident in myself, being in such a tight-knit, intense moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like the Boston Celtics has always been a franchise that has a lot of respect, has had a lot of talent, has had a lot of people come in and left their mark here. It just makes it that much more of an experience for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"Their voice is law. If you're on bullsh-- they're going to call you out. At the same time, they have the same respect for you if they're on bullsh-- and you're supposed to call them out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like they both act younger than me off the court. They're both joking, joyous, trying to put a smile on everybody's face. But whenever it comes to on the court, there's a certain switch that they turn on. You can see it in their eyes. The kill mentality, just go out there and hoop, go out there and get the best shot, go out there and try to be the best basketball player possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"It's not game day yet, but it's obviously very special to be here. This is what you dream of, just making it here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"As a team, we have our ups and downs during the season, but we deserve to be here. We want to take advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Theres a little bit of a history, so I think it will be very energetic. But that's why we are mentally prepared. We just have to keep the composure, focus on ourselves, what we have to do. Play with the same energy that we had in the last games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"The days off obviously helped. I had a little bit more time to get treatment in and work on strength and everything else, also on conditioning. Overall feeling great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, it's the Playoffs, so there's limited time. You get back and get the amount, the reps, practice. But we did a great job I think of ramping it up before that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Also the minutes were kind of restricted, too. We tried to make the best out of it. It's not ideal, but it's what you got to live with. I think we did a great job overall of pushing with the right pace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think especially after winning the Western Conference Finals it's a thought that you have. Now its really game to game, you can't get too excited because it's a lot of ups and downs for each individual game, for the whole series. You just got to stay locked in and prepare the same way for every game, keep your composure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"No, it's just like to stabilize it a little bit, some comfort for the shoulder. Nothing to get adjusted to, or change. No big changes here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"I think every series that we play prepared us a little bit for that because we had other lineups against Minnesota where they had five guys that shot. I think we have a really strong defensive core now, with Gafford and Lively playing big. I think they're also doing a great job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"Overall we have so many defensive possibilities, lineups that we can throw out there, without having big disadvantages."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,MAXI KLEBER,"It will change a little bit because they play a little bit more five-out. Obviously, the rotations, defensive rotations, will be a little bit different. That's why we worked on it for a long time. Hopefully we can just adjust to it in the game tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"No, when you talk about it didn't work, did it work, I only had him for a short period of time. I thought it was going well in the sense of our defense, his ability to block shots, rebound."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Then offensively we looked to post him up a little bit more than Rick Carlisle had used him in the post, which was strictly on the perimeter shooting threes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Both worked. He has the skill set to do both. As you know, in the business of basketball, there's trades that take place. We're judged if it works or doesn't work. That's just part of the business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"For the short period I had him, I really enjoyed KP. Great, great on the floor, great off the floor. Did everything we asked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Again, his game, when you talk a big who can put the ball on the floor, who can score, I believe can play in the post. In today's game there's a lot of threes, not a lot of post-up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Well, you said that, Eddie. I did not smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"We believe he's super athletic. But when you talk about basketball IQ, everybody has different levels. When you look at Luka's level of understanding the game, time and score, who's on the floor, he is at the head of the class in that sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think you do have to experience it. I think that's the nicer way to accept losing, is that you have to go through it. It's a graceful way to accept losing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But you do have to, again, go through defeat to understand that bad taste, how do you feel, how does it make you feel, to work on your game, to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"There are times when you're just not good enough. As a player, unfortunately with the Nets, we played the Lakers, we weren't just good enough and we got swept. There are some cases that you run into Shaq and Kobe. You got to just take defeat and then move on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"We did bounce back to come back. But I think you do. Jayson and Brown have gone through defeat. We also lost to the Warriors, too, that year. The Warriors are really good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But they learned something. You could see they're playing at a high level right now, winning 64 games, the best team in the NBA. To be penciled in at the beginning of the season, that puts a little pressure or stress because you're supposed to be here. They fulfilled that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But that tandem, they're playing at an extremely high level and we got our work cut out. But they've been here. Some of us for the Mavs have been here, some of us haven't. We're going to embrace that and find a way to hopefully win a series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"It's simple talent. Sometimes you don't have enough talent. As I brought up the Lakers and Nets, we were happy to be there, but we just didn't have enough talent to beat Kobe and Shaq. It could be that simple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"But nerves sometimes play a part, too. Just the human side of things. But at the end of the day, as much as we've talked about it, to embrace it, to stay steady, and to enjoy this time because you're not promised anything to come back the following year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"To do everything, this isn't a vacation. This is a road trip in the sense of a job. We have an opportunity here to find a way to win on the road. That's how we're approaching it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JASON KIDD,"This is the best of the best at the highest level. It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I did. Is that the first question smiling? Oh, God, I love it. Got to love this, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I have a great reaction. It's appreciated. There's a lot of gratitude there, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Definitely miss him. Playing out there, just making things easier, being able to run up and down the floor, just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air, as athletic as they come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other. Off the court, our families meshing well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I definitely think about those times. Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him, some of the great teachers that have come before me. I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Shout-out to LeBron for that. Knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to the future and getting this series started now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it is a fleeting feeling, to be real with you. There's so many peers of mine that have spent long years in the NBA trying to make it to the NBA Finals, Western Conference Finals, Eastern Conference Finals. Have gotten very close or almost struggled or strived every year to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"I had a chance to do it in my fourth year, my fifth year, my sixth year. When I look back at those memories, never regretful of how I treated it, but a little disappointed on how I approached just that success. I wanted to be able to enjoy it and take a breather, really take in the moment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"You're in the middle of a 76-year history. I'm in the middle of a 76-year history now, but then we were in years of history. The NBA is very young still as a business. When you ascend to this level, put in a lot of hard work, you beat some of the best in the world, competing with some of the best in the world. I looked at it as, oh I'm going to be here every single year. At this age I've been through what I've been through, been able to come out on the other side. I look at it as an opportunity that I don't want to take for granted. I want it to last as long as possible emotionally just because of how much it took to get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship. So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that. I'm just very real, very honest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"That's what's helped me grow as a leader, accepting what I can't control, and what I can't, letting it lay to the wayside. Letting that go, how it's going to go, that's life. Basketball has been a great teacher for me, but life has been an even better one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Using those same principles I've learned in life apply to basketball has allowed me to connect to my teammates better. There's no silent treatment that's coming randomly throughout the year because I don't know how to emotionalize or vocalize how I'm feeling. Some of the things I struggled with as a young player, I've now been able to accept this is what comes with being in this position. Taking on the pressure. Then also teaching my teammates how to get through it. Also look them to teach mere."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Just staying a student and enjoying the craft, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Man, shot out to God Shammgod. He's been imperative in just helping me grow, enjoying the game every single day, competing. I feel like he's just one of my uncles just from Harlem, New York, that's there to give me a little s--- when I need it but be honest all the time. Remind me this is bigger than basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Shout-out to God Shammgod. He's helped me a lot this year, been there every single day to help work me out. Also inspire the next generation. He does it in his own way. I'm just following his footsteps, just like other uncles of mine who have done great things in this world."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, I've experienced Boston twofold my first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, then being right down the street in Brooklyn, now being here in the Finals playing against them in a potential four-to-seven-game series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"You just got to breathe through it. To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"Then the first question was? Oh, playing against my former brothers. Yeah, no, I'm excited. They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,"They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KYRIE IRVING,This is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year of putting in the time to prepare for moments like this.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"Just really excited. Just excited to be in this position. At the beginning of camp, that's all we've been talking about, being in this position again. I'm just grateful. Right now, just trying to take this experience in of the Media Day, per se. It's just a fun time, a fun time for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"I'm enjoying it. This is a part of it. I feel like the first time we went through it, I feel like it was a bit overwhelming, just a lot going on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"This time around, I feel like we all understand it a little better. I'm very appreciative to be in this position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, just continuing to stay consistent in the things that I did, coming in, working out individually, doing our team stuff when we needed to. It was just for a longer, extended period of time. Staying really locked in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"I think the first day I took a day off right after Indiana, Game 4. After that, I just continued with my routine, continued to stay ready, taking advantage of the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"For me, this time off, I feel like it's been good to get me as prepared as best I can for tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"It's great. He's obviously a very big part of what we do. Just everything that he brings on the floor. He's a threat offensively. As we know, he shoots it, he can post, he protects the rim for us. It's just a really good thing for us to be able to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,I'm excited. I know I'm excited. I know our fans are even more excited. It's the Finals. They're going to be rowdy. They're going to get after it. 830 start. I'm just happy. I can't wait until tomorrow. I can't wait to see them bring that energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"I think it's a thing. I think so. I think being in this position, this situation, everything we have to manage, it can be overwhelming your first time dealing with all this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"The good thing about playing for the Boston Celtics is that the expectation is always there. When I came here eight years ago, this is what I came here for, for these kind of moments. What you say is pressure, nobody is going to put pressure on themselves more than we do, more than I do individually myself. I'm just really excited for this opportunity."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I mean, I feel like he's looked good. Kristaps, he's more of a gamer. I know when the game comes around, if he says he's playing, he's going to be ready to roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You do your best to stay away. Your mental health is probably the biggest thing, especially playing in the NBA Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But not only that, I mean, everybody gets scrutinized, right? When I was in Milwaukee, it was about Giannis not having enough help the first two games, whatever. The pressure that J.B. and J.T. have to take on is something different. I've told them this before, but it's really impressive how they handle themselves, how they stay professional, how they still come out every game and do what they do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think it's extremely impressive how they do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,Pray smiling.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"No, I think it's just familiarity. Just I think knowing each other's game, doing your best to stay in front of him, trying to take away the things that will probably hurt you the most. Probably most of all having help. Him being able to see multiple guys on the court, making it look like it's crowded, making shots as tough as possible, even though he's a tough shot-maker, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think he's always been great, to be honest. I do think play-making, he's done a really good job, and that's something I never really saw from him before. He's never afraid to take the big shot. He's never been afraid of that big moment. I think making the right plays in moments is something I've noticed since I've been his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"One thing, the talent. I know sometimes talent doesn't always mesh together. This does. You saw it during the regular season. You've seen it throughout the playoffs, how any given night everybody is just unselfish. I feel like we sacrifice for each other. That's kind of what makes it go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Then I think it's just the will to win. I think this team really wants to win. I know they've been to the Eastern Conference Finals a million times. They've been to the Finals. They've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Now that we're here, we want to get the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"He never wants to sit out. He never wants to sit out. I've played with a lot of players. When you have your best player who wants to play every single game, takes the game that seriously, even if they're banged up with an ankle, knee, whatever it is, still goes out there and plays, I think it shows a lot. Not only him as a basketball player, but his character, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not for me. I would just like to add to it. I think to be a part of history would be cool, especially a history that the Celtics have and everything that comes with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Again, I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"But to add to that is I feel like a part of the reason why I was brought here, the part of reason why I wanted to come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I saw something or somebody told me said they started from the bottom, literally at the bottom, now they're at the top. That's really cool to see, especially playing against both of 'em during the season with their previous teams, seeing their role, how it went for them, then watching them in the Playoffs, being intricate, huge parts of why their team is so successful."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,It's really cool to see. They definitely are energy guys. They're guys that mesh well with that team and really make them go. It's going to be a challenge for us to stop them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,THE MODERATOR,"Thanks, Jrue."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JRUE HOLIDAY,"You do your best to stay away. Your mental health is probably the biggest thing, especially playing in the NBA Finals."

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's pretty special. Trying not to take it for granted. Not everyone gets this opportunity. So just trying to make the most of it, especially being on the path that I've been on. It's been like a wild ride almost. But it's been cool. Just trying to cherish every moment. You never know how long it's going to last."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Like I said before, I just try never to take it for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"There's nothing like tangible that I switch out in my workouts or anything. It's just trying to stay confident, maybe going back and looking at highlights where I'm on a heater or something like that. Just to know that, like, I'm still the same guy, it's just shots aren't going in sometimes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"It happens to everybody in this game. That's why you play the game of basketball. That's why it's a team sport, not just an individual sport. I try to impact the game other ways. Obviously shooting is the loud impact that I make. But I always know that water finds its level. It usually regresses to the mean. Shots are bound to start falling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Sometimes I just search up my name and watch the first couple videos that come up. Sometimes when you're in a hole or a slump like that, you just need something to bring you out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I think we're just excited to get going. I think, I don't know, it's been eight or nine days since we played our last game. Everybody is anxious to get back on the court, play in front of these fans. I know the Garden is going to be rocking tomorrow. We're excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, well, I think we all had a goal at the start of the year. We wanted to be at this point. I think each day we just treated it as its own entity, not look too far ahead."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"We knew we had the talent, but it's more of like we got to go show it and prove it. Now we're here. We definitely celebrated getting back here, but now we're laser focused for tomorrow. Hopefully going to come out on top this time as opposed to two years ago."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,This experience is amazing. I look at it as a blessing. A lot of people play their careers and never get a chance to play in the Finals.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,I would never take this for granted. I'm just super grateful to be here. Can't wait to get started.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Kyrie has helped all of us, those going through this the first time. He told us to just stay in the moment, lean on each other. We're all brothers. Just being there for each other. Stand together, stick together, trusting each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, that experience was super fun, to have the opportunity to go out there and play on the highest stage in the Playoffs, be able to perform. I was super grateful. I want to thank God for all of the blessings that He's blessed me with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"All that confidence comes from hours in the gym, late nights, just having confidence in my abilities. When I go out there, I feel like I'm confident in my ability to go out there and perform."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"I don't look it as an underdog. I feel like we have a bunch of guys that are hungry, I would say that. We have a bunch of guys that are hungry and ready for this moment. We're not going to take this for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"I feel like with the pace we play with, I feel like with our bigs, how athletic they are, I feel like we have good depth with our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, I think about it. I've been thinking about it every day, how these days just keep approaching. It's getting closer and closer. I'm just super excited to get out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, it's going to be a lot of energy in this building. It's probably going to be hostile. We already know what is expected. We going to come in hungry and ready to fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"This is awesome. I've dreamed of this opportunity as a kid, my whole life. It's something you work for. I think being here now, it's amazing. It's bright lights. I think the guys are ready to go. It's been our number one goal since the season started."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"I think the history says it for itself. Like I said, everyone is excited. It's one of my favorite places to play in the NBA. I'm looking forward to it. The rest of the guys are, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"I think we obviously respect them a lot as a team. They're a great team, coached amazing. I think everyone we faced in the Playoffs has been a great challenge for us. I think it adds to that. It's exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"It's weird, man. Looking back at it, it's crazy. There's so many times in my career, whether it's high school, college, it felt like everything was going the wrong way in life. Especially my first couple years in the NBA."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"To be able to reflect on this and see where we are as a team nowadays, it's super fun. It's exciting. It continues to motivate me. I still feel like I'm young in my career. But, yeah, it's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"I mean, I knew I'd be on it in like in 2K or something or playing My Career as a kid growing up, always dreaming of being in the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"But I think it's hard to say I knew I'd be here. Where I come from in Australia, Castle Hill, you dream of stuff like this. Pretty sure the little me would be very happy with myself. I would say I worked very hard to get where I'm at, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, the atmosphere is amazing here in the regular season, so I can only imagine what it's going to be like tomorrow night. It's going to get the adrenaline going. It's going to be exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JOSH GREEN,"He means everything. Kyrie has been an amazing leader for not only me but everyone else on the team. He's competitive. Since day one, all sights have been on making it to the Finals. It's not only Kyrie. Kyrie is a great leader. Luka is a great leader. All the team has been so tight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Being confident and being pretty much prepared for anything, 'because nine times out of ten I'll be out on the perimeter a lot more defending. Just being comfortable in that situation. There's going to be times when I'm out on the perimeter, in the paint, protecting the basket. There's going to be a lot of stuff thrown at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Being comfortable in that situation, being confident I make sure I make those reads and being able to rotate defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmm. Just coming out, setting the tone. We got a lot of energy around this team. We got a great atmosphere around this team. If we come out with our heads on straight, I feel like it's going to be a pretty good situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"What's crazy, when I got traded, we were actually headed here to play Boston. I got to the practice facility. Wizards General Manager Will Dawkins called me and said there's a possibility you'll be going to Dallas. I said, okay, let me know. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes. He called me and said, You've been traded to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I would say when it comes to the emotions of getting traded, you could be mad, you could be happy. I would say I didn't really have a crazy reaction to it because I've been in the situation before. I just took this as a point, one door closed, another door opened for me. So this is another opportunity for me to kind of like progress throughout my career."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I just wanted to make sure I most definitely took the right approach to it. I didn't really want to think too much on it. Like I said, it's another opportunity for me. I just took this as this is another step down my path of success."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, man, the first game when we were there, Luka threw the first lob to me. The crowd went crazy. The Dallas crowd reminds me a lot Bud Walton Arena when I was in college, for sure. Just being in that atmosphere like that, love and energy throughout the arena. It's just something that I felt like I missed just throughout my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much the same. Go out and stay confident and comfortable when it comes to just like the position we're going to be in defensively. Offensively, not letting them speed us up. They got a lot out of veteran defenders -- Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, he's around the basket blocking shots. There's a lot of guys that are guards that can block shots, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Honestly, one of the best human beings to be around. When I got here to now, just seeing how he carries himself, how he talks. One of the best people to be around. He embraces everything he's been through, and he's found ways to just improve and progress from that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I've heard him talk about when he was here, transitioning to Brooklyn. He said he learned a lot. It takes a lot of just like humble and humility just to go through something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"I would say he's one of the best people in the world to be around, because everybody has had some type of situation. You see me at my worst. You never pay attention to just like the progress of how I'm trying to better myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"Because we are players. That's the main thing, in my opinion. Because we're players. We see him as a teammate, we see him as an opponent. At the end of the day, he is the same person on the court and off the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"There's a lot of great memories with KP. I always used to expect to come in and have a challenge day in and day out going against him in practice. He's one of the guys that used to always, like, motivate me when it came to the things that I did on the floor. I really appreciated him with certain areas that he helped me progress in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANIEL GAFFORD,"He helped me a lot defensively, too, guarding a guy of his height, a guy that shoots over you. You crawl up into his airspace, he still shoots over you. Finding a way to make that not happen was something I always focused on every day going into practice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's a little different because it's the middle of the day. Obviously, I remember growing up, I wasn't able to watch it being at school. I mean, it's something that everyone watches. I know they have watch parties all over the country. It's a big event and everyone watches it down there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, you could have asked me two years ago if I was going to be here, I would have been shocked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"I think it's kind of the hard work and dedication that I've put into my game. Staying focused throughout it all, through the ups and downs, injuries. Making sure I always got back to just loving basketball, just wanting to be on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Obviously, when I got this opportunity in Dallas, jump on it. I knew we had a good team, but to even look at a year ago and say I'd be here, it's crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"I mean, yeah, you always dream about it. I think just being a kid from Australia, even getting to the NBA was a big thing. More and more guys are doing it now, so it's becoming a thing that a lot of kids growing up look at it like, I can do that, it's not so farfetched."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"It's definitely something you look at, yeah, I did not see this. It's just hard work and you continue to grind every year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, we've been here during the season, kind of the hostility they showed toward Kyrie. They're just passionate. I'm all for it. I love it. They just want their team to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,It's going to be the same when they go to Dallas. It's just going to be a fun series.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's peaks and valleys. The biggest thing I've done is try not to get too high on the highs and low on the lows. There were some very lows. I think I used everything as an opportunity to get better or as a challenge. Definitely going to Europe helped propel my game, build confidence, be a leader on a team of young guys. I think that helped me a lot, to get me to where I am today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know. I don't know why it didn't work out. We were still both young. We tried to make it work, but it just didn't work. So moved on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, his leadership is amazing. The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it. He's keeping us all together and motivated."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Some things he's done, I mean, especially in practice, it's insane. The things he even tries in the game, it's insane. I never seen nobody make those shots. I don't see nobody try those shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,Obviously we know the handles. Just some shots are crazy. It's amazing just to experience this live.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think we'll see how my knee is. But if it's a good, I'm going to go play, yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"More games. You forgot, what was it, World Cup before the season smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Amazing. First time here. Hopefully it's not the last game. But never take it for granted. You never know if you are going to come back, so just enjoy the experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,I think it's very loud crowd. Everybody knows that. They been known for that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,It's hard to play in this place. The crowd is amazing for their team. All I got to say is we got to stay together. It's us against them. We got to stay together.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,But it's going to be really hard to play in this crowd.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it speaks a lot. You seen more examples, too. But I think they fit perfectly with us. The trade made us a so much better team, especially on the defensive end. So, they're in the perfect roles that we need."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it was I remember it, it was quarterfinals of EuroLeague against Panathinaikos in Panathinaikos. The crowd went crazy. They started winning 20-0. Imagine that smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Well, I think it was, like, five questions smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it was great. Definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here. It's been great to see his journey, see where he's at, all the stuff he's going through, stuff like that, to be where he's at it's amazing, it's dope to see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, you learn and grow from your experiences, from being a 25-year-old to being a 27-year-old is a big difference. Yeah, I'm 27 smiling. You learn from those experiences."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"We got a different team. We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka now we have Joe Mazzulla. We had Marcus Smart, Rob Williams we have Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis. Different team, different coach two years later makes a pretty big difference."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think Brad has been great in his role as GM. He was a great coach. I think he just continued that by just being a great GM, being able to put the right pieces together and things like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just happy for him. His schedule has been able to settle down, probably putting a little bit less stress on him than we did when he was coaching us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, no, Brad has been great since he's been a part of the Boston organization. He's helped bring this organization back in terms of winning. He's now been able to move into that GM position and put the right pieces together to get us back to the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of. So I would say a few times at least I've watched the Finals, the whole thing, all the way through."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,Two different people. Two different guys. Joe's got his own style. Ime has his own style. Both were great coaches.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Joe has been able to emphasize what we wanted to be offensively. We're with Joe a little bit longer. Joe had an interim year. Now this is his second year in a sense. Ime only had one year. So it's hard to really compare, contrast, to be honest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, D-White has been great all season long. He's been aggressive. We've empowered him. He's primed for these moments. We want him to come out and recognize when it's his time to strike."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,We feel comfortable with him doing so because he's been doing it all season long.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,I think it's fair. I think it's a fair question. I think it's fair to say that it does affect you being embraced versus being scrutinized.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"One of my favorite quotes is, like, The child who isn't embraced by the village, something like that, you will, what is it? Y'all know this quote, right? You will feel like the warmth."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"The child that doesn't feel the warmth of the village will burn it down, something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, whatever. Neither here nor there smiling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"But, you know, referencing that, you get to a point where it's, like, you get scrutinized enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal. Then it just rolls off you. For me, at least, I can say. I don't know if Jayson feels the same way. It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,It just becomes another headline.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's a great question, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,I think this is a special group. I really do. The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"It means a lot. It's a real testament to my hard work, all the time I put in in the gym. I tell myself this is where I want to be, this is where I want to play at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"Being here is great. It's a blessing, especially getting here right now. Something I've been dreaming of my whole life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"I wouldn't say natural. I look at all the videos, but just a lot of trying to learn stuff. It's kind of turned into a hobby."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"I feel like now in the NBA you kind of have to expect stuff like that with the way that teams play, especially the way we play. We have guys, sometimes J.T. is at the five. Myself, as well. We can throw anything out there. Just be prepared, be ready for anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,I've been doing that for a while. I think college. I played it in college sometimes. In high school. Because I was always the tallest guy. I can guard one through five. Feel like switching up is easy for me always.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"No, that's always been in me. I love basketball. I love playing basketball. Before anything, I was a fan of basketball. I liked watching. All of my brothers played. It started from that. Now being here on the biggest stage, some of the best players in the world, that's just who I am."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,OSHAE BRISSETT,"I love staying engaged. It helps me stay focused, stay locked in. It's just something that, for me, helps me. I also know it helps the guys out there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I have no idea where I was going to go. Every time it kept counting down, just didn't know where to go. Still, I was praying. I was really talking to God the whole entire time, for real. It is what it is. I was in Houston, training just in Houston. So it's time to go back."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, it's the same thing. I'm young, too, so just another piece to add to the table, add to the recipe they've got going on. Just happy to be a part of that program, that organization. Just a lot of rebuilding that has to be going on, but it doesn't really faze me. At the end of the day, I'm just ready to be a Rocket."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"Different feeling, but then again, it's the same feeling. I've been overlooked a lot of times in my life, so it didn't really faze me. I'm just really happy to be in the NBA. I've been dreaming about that all my life. Just really grateful for my parents just being there, my friends, family. I mean, everybody is here. The best day of my life. Just really the start."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"It motivates me to like 150 percent to -- I don't even know. It's just something where I've got to rethink, go in the next day, new mind, free mind. Coming into that organization with a chip on my shoulder, have a lot of motivation on my mind."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"At the end of the day, it doesn't really faze me. I know I'm different than everybody else, but it's just another chapter in my life, another step in the journey. Time to get to work."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, I've been go-getting -- like it doesn't even matter, just in general. Just trying to get better every day, learning about myself on and off the floor. It's definitely something that's been on my mind, but just can't let it faze me. That's really it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, everybody is versatile. Literally just drafted Amen. He's a great player, great athlete. Somebody who I can definitely play alongside. I'm just definitely looking forward to it. So that versatility type of area, I can definitely just add to the table."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"No, I promise you there's not. I have no idea. I don't know what happened. But I feel fine. It's my body. If they think it's something different, they have their own opinions. But at the end of the day, it's my body."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"I mean, like I said, everybody can do everything on the floor. Defend, run the floor, rebound, block shots, they can shoot. That's just an advantage. Everybody is an athlete. So there's a lot of run and jump. Run up the floor, that's my play style. I think it will be a great fit with those guys, definitely."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CAM WHITMORE,"Well, I just left Houston. I've been there since about a month and a half, just training there with Leo and also training with Aaron Miller. It's time to go back, get right back to work. That's really it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,I can't really describe it. It's still fresh. One of the best feelings of my life. Probably the best night of my life. I've been dreaming about this for so long. It's a dream come true. It's incredible.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Longest five minutes of my life. This is when I started getting the butterflies, and it's where I started seeing my family get silent. Everyone watching their watch."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Then I got called, and I went to the back. I was congratulated by a lot of people there. I saw Adam Silver, shook his hand again, gave him a hug. Then someone gave me this Spurs jersey. Someone knew this was happening somehow. Laughter."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,I just got a lot of love.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, this is when it started to feel a little bit real. But it still isn't completely real. At that moment, yeah, I started visualizing the thing."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"You know, very, very casual. I did get phone calls. Yeah, I was just told that they were waiting to work with me. They just wanted to reassure me and to keep me going, because I was in the Playoffs in my season. It was very casual."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"He's not intimidating yet, but I'm sure he's going to get intimidating when I see him in real life."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I need to see footage of this. My message to them is I'm going to give 100 percent, make all that's in my power to make this franchise win, to have impact on the franchise and the fan base and the community."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"They never talked to me really clearly about the NBA because they were such -- how I do say? It was so important, the seasons we were playing, that they didn't really talk to me about the NBA that much, but more about how to prepare for the NBA."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"As we have known I was going to the Spurs for so long, they never really told me about the Spurs, either."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah. Some players have tried to win the championship, win a ring for years and haven't made it. I don't want to be one of those. This is going to be -- my goal is going to be to get closer and closer every time to the ring and to learn how to make it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Probably Finals game, 2013, 2014, around that time. Yeah, this is my farthest memory."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,Not skip any steps for me makes sense because it's easy to make that mistake. I'm glad I got people around me that can help me not make that mistake.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Tim Duncan, if I got the opportunity to work with him, is going to be -- I can't really think of a better role model."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I've been thinking about learning Spanish for a long time. But I've been kind of busy ever since the lottery. But this is going to happen some day, yeah."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,Breakfast tacos. I've heard a lot about breakfast taco.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I can't wait to wear my first Spurs jersey. Yeah, I can't wait. It's the start of such a great adventure. You never know what's going to happen, and this is what's exciting. That's it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"A Tony Parker fan, for sure. Yeah, so I guess it made me a Spurs fan, also. I'm really glad -- I've felt so much love toward me by the Spurs fans ever since May 16th. I think there's murals of me in the city center in San Antonio. It's just incredible. I could not ask for a better welcome than this. I really love the fan base, man."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"You're right, the game shifted a little bit in the last couple years. I think it makes sense because you need a combination of skill but also of luck and genetics to be the best. The best lately have been bigs, and European bigs."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"Yeah, the road is going to be very long for me to reach the top, but I'm ready to learn from anybody."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,VICTOR WEMBANYAMA,"I don't know if, as you said, the kids, the seven-footer kids and stuff can learn a lot from me. But they can learn more from themselves. The most important is to know yourself."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CASON WALLACE,"Hamilton Park, Texas. It's my neighborhood I grew up in. I just wanted to send a message to everybody out there that thinks that they can't make it as far as they want to because of where they come from. I'm just living proof that it doesn't matter where you come from, just stay true to yourself and whatever you set your mind to, you can accomplish."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,CASON WALLACE,"Definitely. It's a nice drive for my family, if they want to come. But it's just a great spot. It's right there, but it's not too close to home to where they're there every day. I've got a little distance but not too much."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"In terms of certainty, it's not really something I pay much mind to. I knew at the end of the day I had no control over it. My workouts, I was just going out there hooping, just working out. I didn't overthink it. I felt like it was just another workout to me. So I was just out there doing what I do."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"I would say a hard worker and a versatile defender and just a versatile all-around defender as well. There's a lot of things I can do on the basketball court. They'll see that when I get to the team, with practices and just more games under my belt once I start getting more comfortable."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"Yeah, I've got no clue how they want to -- I mean, I have an idea, but I feel like that's just up to the coach, how he wants to use me, what spots he wants to put me in. He's a very smart coach. He'll be able to figure that out."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"I don't think he would believe it, honestly. I honestly didn't expect myself to get to this point. Like, it's not something at a younger age I really thought about. Basketball is just what I like to do. So I just continue to work hard, just put in effort and then it kind of just came to fruition."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JARACE WALKER,"Yeah, super excited. High-level player, high-level passer, high-IQ guy, very unselfish. It's the perfect guy you want to play with. So I'm excited to get out there and just get a good connection with him."

But it means a lot to my family seeing all the hard work pay off. Us go back to back, be the first twins in the same draft to go top five, it means a lot."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,I definitely heard about them. My mom told me she used to listen to the Thompson Twins. I heard they're not even really twins. So we're the real ones.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,"Yeah, we're getting a lot of endorsement deals like a duo. It's been fun to shoot those with him, and just the whole process has been great."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,"I think I've become more of a vocal leader, but first I lead by example and I think I can bring that to Houston. I think Houston got a lot of players that have great potential, and I think they have a scary future."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,"I don't know much, not much yet, but I feel like I'm about to learn a lot in the next couple months."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,I was born first. A minute. One minute.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,"It was weird, we never really talked about going back to back. We just talked about both being top 10. I never really thought about it, but it's cool that that's how it ended up being the way it happened."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,AMEN THOMPSON,"Just work on my shot, my ball handling, just everything. Everything that can help me make an immediate impact."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER,"To answer your question, I would say they're going to get a guy that is going to work his tail off every day to get better and help the team get better. I'm going to be the hardest worker on the floor, a guy that you can count on to defend multiple positions and a guy on offense that you can count on to drive, knock down open shots, finish above the rim.

All that matters is to believe in yourself and go out there and be yourself. At the Combine, my workouts, I was just trying to be myself, in terms of being the hardest worker, loudest guy on the floor, making all the hustle plays, playing defense and controlling what I can control, and letting everything else be."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER,"That's how I was able to have a really good performance in the Combine and really good performances in my workouts, because I focused on the things I could control and I outworked everybody out there. That's how you're able to shoot well and do all the other stuff, because you focus on the right things. That's been my mindset through this whole process."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER,"Coming in, nobody thought I was going to be here right now. But I believe in myself. I'm going to do this. I'm going to show them.

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER,"Oh, man, they've helped me so much. I'm so happy I chose them to be my agency. Both my agents, Todd Ramasar, Mike Simonetta, have been just awesome. They've believed in me since day one. They believed that I could be here today. They were like, O-Max, what's your vision? They believed in my vision, and they said, let's go, let's work."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,OLIVIER-MAXENCE PROSPER,"I did everything under my control to be here and they did everything under their control. They pushed the envelope. They talked to a lot of teams. They were proactive in everything they did, and I'm so grateful for them."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI,"I think I bring a lot to the Warriors. I think in the NBA I could be a triple-double guy. I could dribble, pass and shoot at a high level. Competitor, toughness. Things I bring to the table like shooting. I'll be playing alongside the two best shooters in the world."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BRANDIN PODZIEMSKI,"People question my defense. I get to play against Draymond Green, All-Defensive player, Gary Payton, All Defensive player. The room for improvement is right there and it's right in front of me. So I'm really excited to be a part of this organization. I think I'm a perfect fit for them, and they're a perfect fit for me. I want to win a championship this year."

I'm really excited to have this opportunity."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BRANDON MILLER,"When I found out, probably at least two seconds before they called me name, it's exciting. It's a dream come true.

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"The G League experience has prepared me so much because I really got that feel for the game. With the game that we play in the G League, it's the same thing as the NBA -- the pace, the competitiveness and everything that goes to it. Guys that are coming up and down from the league, guys trying to make their way into the league. I already have that feel. Going into it, I feel like my game right now is ready, and I'm better than ever."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"I feel like that will work to my advantage because with that in my bag and then all the other things I have to offer, it makes me tougher to guard. When you game-plan against me, there are so much things I could do out there. Having people on their toes and aware of me out there. It's good I can do those things, but I'm just continuing to get better and add more."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"His coaching style made me like him so much because he likes dogs and I feel like I'm a dog out there on the court. I bring it every night.

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"I've had an interview with the Spurs, so I got a sense of who is in the office, the staff that the Spurs have as an organization. I'm familiar with Jeremy Sochan on the team. I talked to him. Also what they've done in the past with Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, that era. They were really successful, and they have a history of winning."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,LEONARD MILLER,"Right now they're trying to get it back to what it was before. It can definitely be done because the organization is really good, and they have good people to get it back to what it needs to be."

Whenever you finally hear your name on the screen, you hear it in the crowd, you hear it in the loud speakers, it's like a dream just getting started. My dream is not to get to the NBA but to stay in the NBA. It's kind of starting the ball rolling, and let's see where it goes."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, it's always been some form of competitive nature, not even on the East Coast, just in Philadelphia, having that grit, having that hustle and having that determination to do whatever it takes. No matter how hard the world will beat you down, you've got to get back up and fight twice as hard."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"Whenever I think about Westtown, I think about when I was a freshman watching, I was probably 6'10"", weighed 190. Even thinking about Team Final, I was probably 6'7"", 170."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"Just thinking about how far I've came and the people that came with me, I'm so grateful and I'm so thankful."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,DERECK LIVELY II,"Living at a high school -- I went to a boarding school, so I was always kind of living on my own and I was always able to do that. But being able to take basketball from a game that you enjoy and turning it into a business and your career, it takes not a step, it takes a leap. It just kind of takes the maturity you've got to have to be able to focus in on each practice, each film session, each game, and being able to try to get 1 percent better every day."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"Before that, I'm just kind of taken aback. I didn't really listen to -- I was looking at Kobe Bufkin. Just got picked, man. There's a lot of emotions going on. I might cry for him, not even me."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"Man, it's my brother. It's my brother, man. We've been through tough times this year. We weren't successful as we wanted to be, but just being in the trenches with him and seeing how well he carried himself and him showing me the ropes as a freshman, it means a lot to me just to see him over there smiling like that. That's for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"It's exciting. It feels like my work has paid off. Yeah, I honestly feel like I can't wait to go out to Summer League and just prove that I'm supposed to be in this spot."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"Honestly, I feel like I'll fit in like a glove with my ability to space the floor and make open shots. I've always been able to play with good other players throughout high school and college, so I think I'll fit in really well with them."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JETT HOWARD,"I forgot about that, wow. Yeah, he just told me that. It means the world. These past few months, he's been pushing me to places I've never been conditioning-wise, and just to see my work pay off like that, it's a beautiful moment. All praise to God, honestly."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"It's honestly really crazy and kind of hard to say how I feel because growing up I was a big Kobe fan. I was always watching his videos, watching the Lakers. For me to get drafted by the Lakers is kind of surreal and kind of crazy."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Even going back a little bit, sitting in that chair, I'm not really a person who gets too high or too low. Today, my emotions were like a roller coaster So it was everywhere. To finally get that call and hear my name called, it was kind of like a relief."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"For me to get drafted there, I'm going to bring it every day, like I said, try to impact as much as I can and learn from the guys that are there, especially for one of the all-time greats, LeBron James, and AD and the rest of the guys. It's going to be great."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"I think really just my approach. I'm a player who I'm going to bring it every day, work hard and I think I check a lot of boxes. Obviously, I'm a big guard, size, can score from all three levels, unselfish, get my teammates involved and then I can also really guard, guard multiple positions. Overall, I think I'm a really good player and an even better person."

2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"I think the first person I could remember off the top of my head was watching Bam Adebayo go to the Miami Heat. I was watching his highlights from high school probably a couple hours before. I didn't even know the draft was going to come on, and then I turned on the TV, wait a few minutes and he gets drafted. I was like, what? I was just watching his highlights. That was probably the person I could think off the top of my head."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"I know the Utah Jazz, they like to play big. They like big lineups. They like moving Lauri to the 3. I feel like I could fit in that team really well because they have a lot of length, so I'm going to be right with them. My shooting ability could really help them out, as well."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,TAYLOR HENDRICKS,"You never really know on draft night, but on my visit I had a great time with all the people I met with and the dinner. I mean, I love Orlando. I love the city. Love Utah, too. They want me, so I want them."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"I'm just happy. It's finally here. I'm blessed. My family was there with me. To go to Portland is kind of going full circle. My guy Pooh Jeter there, texted Dame not too long ago. So it's up. It's up when I get there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Yeah, I didn't really pay too much attention to that. I paid attention to what mattered and that was the work that went into being here to this day."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"If they do decide to trade or do whatever with the pick, man, I'm just going to continue to work, control what I can."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Man, for sure. I'm the most prepared player in the draft. That's what I say. The fact that I went there for two years just taught me so much. On the court, as well, but a lot of things off the court. I learned how to be a pro off the court. Just so much time off and just trying to find what to do. I found the hobbies that I like to do."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Ignite definitely showed me a lot of things that I wouldn't get anywhere else. I'm blessed that I did the two years that I did, and I grew so much from it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"No, not at all. I'm glad to see Brandon go there. I'm pretty sure it's a great fit for him. That's how I move. I move with love. I'm not mad that I didn't go 2 or I didn't go 1. I'm blessed to go 3, and to be here with my family with me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"We play against pros every night and guys that killed college, guys that killed overseas, guys that are going up and down in the league, coming down just to play against us, to show that they can dominate draft picks or whatever the case may be. That's why I always say prepared."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"We learned a lot of things at the beginning of the season that has nothing to do with skill set, things that go on behind closed doors of basketball, the business of it. Just learned how to be a pro, like I said, on the court and off the court."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,So it was special. It was a special two years.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Yeah, I'm hoping to get to play with Dame, for sure. Special talent, special guard. One of my favorites to watch, especially film-wise. Just to pick out how he moves off the court, as well. Yeah, it would be cool to play with him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"I'm just one of the few in the league right now, so I'm blessed to be a part of that group. I'm blessed to be a part of people from Marietta striving. It's amazing to represent. It's amazing to represent my family and especially the city, my gym, all that. It's great."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"I'm proud of the growth I've had and how much I've grown as a person off the court. I wasn't really talkative and I didn't really speak much, but the second year I grew into a loud person and a leader that needed to come out."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,SCOOT HENDERSON,"Playing the guard position, going into next year, I know I will have to be vocal, especially at the point guard. Just growing that much at that rate, it was great to me. I always look back to that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"You're going to get the best shooter in the draft, championship player, a guy that can space the floor out for Zion and BI."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,She's in Baton Rouge. She was really happy for me. She was giving me congratulations. So it's pretty cool we're going to be in the same state.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"Yeah, I did work out with them. It was one of my better workouts. I had no clue really where I was going to go. A couple of the teams passed up on me that I worked out for, but they took the chance on me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"A whole bunch of emotions. I told somebody I wasn't going to cry, but I wimped out. It was a really cool experience."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"He's meant everything to me. Just said he loved me. I love that guy to death. Without him, none of this is possible. He helped me so much through my career, the two years I was with him. I'm really grateful for him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,They're going to have to see my face every single day. That's going to be lovely.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"I was there for one of my workouts. I was only there for two days, but it's an amazing city. I heard the food is really, really good."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JORDAN HAWKINS,"I didn't get the chance to. I was kind of sick when I was up there, too. I didn't leave my hotel room. I'm probably going to gain a couple of pounds because of the food. So that will be a good thing."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Yeah, the Jazz is going to get a guy that is going to come in, work hard, coachable, willing to learn each and every day. Of course my scoring ability I feel like is one of the best. My creativity with the basketball."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,I know they're going to get an all-around player. Continue to compete each and every day. Just going to play winning basketball.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Right, man. I'm just blessed that they have that belief in me. But to answer your question, he's a legend when it comes to this basketball stuff, so he knows what he's talking about."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"It's going to be fun to be able to pick his brain, continue to learn each and every day from him. He's going to really be that mentor or be that source that I'm able to ask questions and get a full understanding of things that I want to know."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"I just went in there with no expectations. Whatever happens, happens. I felt like I put myself in the best position possible to have a team trust my talent and trust my abilities and trust that I would make an impact on the team."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Now getting my name called, shed a few tears with your family. It's a big relief off your shoulders because this is what you put work in for."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"But now understand, enjoy this night. But now it's time to get to work whenever I get down there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,"Yeah, man, it's an all-time blessing being in the NBA, for one. Two, like you said, they're in a situation. I'm just going there, and whatever the coach needs me to do, whatever my role is, when I have the opportunity to sit down with him and understand what is needed of me, then that's when I'll be able to take that next jump throughout the season, continuing to learn, like I said before."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KEYONTE GEORGE,I'm just excited. I'm just excited to get down there.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Just a player that is really going out there, giving all he's got. The competitiveness, it's the answer a lot of people say, but it's really true for me personally that I want to go out and win. I want nothing more than that. But personally just a versatile type player that takes pride in his shooting. That's just going out there."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Off the court, I like to have fun. So it's going to be a great time in Toronto."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"It's Dorothy from Wizard of Oz. I'm from Kansas, she's from Kansas. I've got her little slippers in my coat. Just the colors, I guess."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"No, I didn't. That was one of my last workouts. I had a great time there. I was hoping, and it kind of worked out good with the colors. I'm beyond blessed. I'm happy."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Get ready because it's going to be a fun time, a fun, fun time. Paired with Scottie Barnes, you already know that's going to be -- I'm looking forward to it. Got to get out there, see Drake. I haven't seen him a bunch, but I'm looking forward to that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,Of course. That's the goal. I need him to wear my jersey. That's how I know -- that's my priority.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Me and Coach, he was there for one of my last workouts a couple weeks ago. Got to meet him for the first time. Just a stand-up, sharp dude. I just got off FaceTime with him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"It's hard to explain. I'm still kind of on this adrenaline rush. But a coach that I look forward to playing with so, so, so much. Being in that system, and then another teammate I talked about earlier was Scottie Barnes. Talked to him on FaceTime and got to know him a little through our agency last year when he went through this process."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,Everything just seems meant to be. So I'm excited.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Like I said, it's hard to put this all into words. But just the raw emotion, that everything comes out when I'm looking around the table seeing how my family is reacting, stuff like that. Tonight I'm going to take it for myself and my family to celebrate, celebrate this success."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"But tomorrow just know that I'm going back out there, and this wasn't the end goal by any means. This is kind of the start to my real-life goals, and that's to be in the NBA and compete."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"I think the biggest one I'm just trying to focus on, it's more a broader one, but really just going out there and trying to make an instant impact. Go there and be a sponge and try to get all the information as a rookie and know that I have a ton to learn and a great coach to learn from and a great team to play with and learn from, also."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Oh, man. A competitor. Two-way player that can play defense. A good playmaker. Can score, too."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Yeah, I hope so, but that's just a great process, too, so I love it. Just waiting for the call and everything, yeah, I love it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Yeah, Wemby is more than a teammate. That's like my brother. I just expect nothing from him, but he's like that. He's just a great guy. So yeah, that's just unbelievable. Yeah, he's good."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"For your first, no, I didn't have any idea. But I was like, Pacers? I didn't talk to them or nothing. So I was like, that's a surprise. But love it. Now that I know the trade and everything, I'm just like, oh, now I understand. So that's it."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"And for French basketball, I'm so happy for it. We're getting more and more in this league. So yeah, just happy for that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,BILAL COULIBALY,"Yeah, we talked a lot about that. We just wish the best for French basketball, French national team. We'll see this summer what's going on. I don't know if I'm going to the French national team or not. We'll see, and just hope the best for that team."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Offensively I think I can bring a lot spacing the floor, decision-making, a bunch of different things offensively."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Defensively is where I hang my hat. Guard multiple positions. We protect the rim. We do it all. From a mental standpoint, I do whatever I'm asked. I'm a good teammate, things like that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"I'd like to think we play a very modern style at Bama, probably the most translatable to the league. Then obviously he always told me, not everybody is going to be a star, some people are going to be role players. You've got to find your role and be the best at your role, and those are the players that play the longest."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,I think finding my role on my new team and perfecting it will be key to my success early.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Truthfully I haven't considered much about most teams because I didn't know where I was going to go until tonight. It's probably something I'll look into more now that I know where I'm going. But again, development is the biggest piece to all this if you ask me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Most of my time was spent in Times Square. I actually came here for a workout I want to say Tuesday. Had a workout, medical, all that good stuff. It was good experience. They had good energy in the workout. Everything went great. To be in the building when I get drafted to them, it was surreal."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"I had a few teams in my head that I knew might want me. I knew after my workout that I was pretty solidified that if I made it there to that pick, that they were going to get me."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"We talk more, truthfully, about workouts, things that we've been doing. To be honest, most of our conversations have been just conversations. It hasn't been about this. We knew it was coming. We knew possibilities, what could happen."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Yeah, I'm happy for him. It was good to see my brother succeeding with me. Yeah, proud of him."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Truthfully, no. Bits and pieces of players I like. I like how some players shoot the ball. I like how some players defend. I like Jaren Jackson he guards multiple positions. Obviously a little bit bigger than me, so I wouldn't compare myself to him necessarily. But I like to pick bits and pieces from different players' games to try to build myself."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"So the players I know, that I've watched the most are Nic Claxton because he's from my area back home, very nearby, and then I like Mikal Bridges because of the role he played with the Suns and then to come here and step up. Kind of waited his turn."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"As a teammate, I'm encouraging but I don't like to let people slide with less than what they're capable of. I hold people accountable, and I hope others hold me accountable."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Off the court, I'm fun. On the court, I'm like, we've got to win this. We've got to get better every day."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"I'm excited, man. The way I always explained it is whoever picked me, that's who really wanted me, and I always want to be somewhere I'm wanted. To be picked here in New York, and this is my first time ever being in New York, so it's exciting. It's very exciting."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"Two to three years from now, that's hard. I never really think about me individually. Obviously, I want to get better and perfect my game in every part possible. I want to be as versatile as I can be, as far as dribbling, shooting, everything. I want to be able to pass the ball well because when you're a good decision-maker, that makes the game a whole lot easier offensively."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,NOAH CLOWNEY,"And defensively, I want to be a force. I want to be in conversations for Defensive Player of the Year awards. That's something I always strive to do. But truthfully, I want playoff runs. I want to win."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Bringing a high level of focus, competitive nature, a defensive presence and, when we get to flow, playmaking and offensive threat."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"It means everything to us. That Michigan team was very tight, and me and Jett specifically were really tight, me and Juwan were really tight. It was like family. When he went to Orlando, there was a level of joy that you're unable to control it. You're happy to see your guys be successful, for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"I mean, Trae Young is an on-ball threat. So I'm comfortable playing on ball if he needs a break, off ball if he doesn't need a break. I feel like I've proven myself to be able to be a threat on or off the ball."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"I'm just looking forward to getting to Atlanta and being able to compete. It's something I've dreamed of, and I'm finally here. Take the most out of it, for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Very excited. This is what we work for. I'm just happy to be successful in this way. There's many different ways this could have ended up, but it took me here, so I'm glad to be here."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Yeah, it's the first time for everybody that is right there, so it's definitely nerves, where am I going to go. All these things are going through your head, but at the end of the day, eventually your name is going to be called. That's kind of like a pillow you can -- it's something that is going to hold you up because you know you're going to go."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Just being here is a dream, and I'm just happy. ATL is the place."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"My first phone call, I haven't had it yet. My first phone call will probably be to my grandma, my grandma Lou. There's a lot of media going on. Definitely calling my granny after this."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,KOBE BUFKIN,"Yes, she is in Grand Rapids."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,"I'm super excited. There's a lot of talent on the floor, a lot of young dudes. It'll be a fun team, for sure."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,"Yeah, it's a good feeling. It's always good playing with dudes who compete on both ends and want to win. I see a lot of that playing with this group, so it's going to be fun."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,I think my playmaking is definitely my best ability. I think playing with two good players like that will make it a little easier on me and them because I can help them get buckets and they can take some of it off me at the same time.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,It's always fun playing with good players whenever you're a playmaking guard.
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,"Just shooting a lot of shots every day, continuing to gain confidence in my jumper, continuing to get stronger in the weight room and attack that every day. That's been the main focus in pre-draft."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,ANTHONY BLACK,For sure. I take a lot of pride in defense. I think that's a lot of the reason I'm here is my defense. I think that's something I can bring from day one. I think that's just something I can bring to the team from day one is probably defense.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"It's just really -- it's a lot of excitement. I think before it was a little more nervousness, now it's just pure excitement to get ready and get to Dallas."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, I think once I moved freshman year into college here in the U.S. and California it was a goal of mine, but then once I think I took that next step to Iowa State, I think the coaches kind of helped me see that view of being able to make it to the league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, it's exciting. You watch them play and now you get to get meet them and be alongside them and watch them practice, and I think it's just a big learning curve that we'll get to have and develop as a player, but yeah, it's pure excitement for sure."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, I think just the people that I've been around just at Iowa State have been so supportive. Even when I got injured, there was tears, and for every athlete it's hard getting injured but they were like, let's take the next step. What do we have to do next? So, they were always encouraging, supportive, getting me to start working out. We were in the gym pretty much all day, but yeah, it's just been all the people at Iowa State have been so great."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, the rehab is going really well. Iowa State, they have great resources that we have been using throughout these few couple months, and our trainers Meaghan Clark and Mercedes, they've been coming alongside me and helping me through every single part of the process, which is a long process, but it's been really great of them."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, it was a very interesting feeling. It's just like pure excitement of going to Washington but now getting to go to Dallas. I mean, yeah, it's going to be a great, great next step to the journey."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, they've been pretty crazy. We've still got school. So, it's just been working out, as well, getting all the workouts we need because we want to get better to 100 percent, so working out, school, and now getting ready for the draft. It's been a crazy last couple weeks, but I've been enjoying every moment of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, just with my length and just being able to help defensively and offensively, spreading out the defense and the offense, playing inside and outside, just versatility, and yeah, all of that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Oh, no, they for sure inspire me a lot. I started playing for the Brazil team five years ago. So I've been able to get to know Clarissa, Erika de Souza, Damiris Dantas. They've kind of helped me through my pathway too. I love them so much, and yeah, they've for sure been a part of my journey."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, for sure surprised. Someone just tapped me, like you got traded. I was like, what? That happened so fast. Yeah, I think I'm just ready to get to Dallas now and start getting to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I mean, it's a dream come true. I can't even put into words right now. You've got a million things going through your mind. But I've been surrounded by good people, good teammates, and I wouldn't be here without any of them."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yep, they went to Marist together. Fortunately, I was in Dallas last week for the Final Four, so got to check it out a little bit. I loved it when I was there. I know they're a young team, really up and coming. So, I'm so happy to be a part of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Oh, gosh, probably USA this summer, 3-on-3. But before then, probably sophomore year."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, I'm super excited. I know the Wings have a lot of great players. Just to be surrounded by great players, I'm just excited."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, for sure. I love Villanova. That'll be home forever. But unfortunately nothing lasts forever, and I feel like God had opened a door, and it was time for me to walk through."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I think I have a really high motor, so just constantly moving without the ball, moving on both sides of the ball, defense and offense. Just going after offensive rebounds and just trying to do all the hustle plays."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Oh, my gosh, I've learned so much. Just believe in yourself, surround yourself with good people and you can achieve anything."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Definitely the people. My coaches, my teammates, the administration, all the people at Villanova. It's such a family, such a community. Just knowing I'm going to have that with me for the rest of my life makes it a little bit easier."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, I think the NIL really allowed college athletes to start to build their brand and I'm fortunate that I caught the beginning of that in the last two years. So just continuing to use the resources around me, using my platform to spread my message and promote my brand."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I was holding onto his hand for dear life, just waiting to hear your name called. But to spend it with them, my family is the most important thing in the world to me, and I would not be here without them. The rest of my extended family is at a restaurant down the street, so I can't wait to go celebrate with them after."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"I think the unknown. I haven't been there yet, so I don't really know what to expect. So yeah, I guess the unknown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Yeah, I mean, I'll play whatever position they need me to play. We're fortunate at Villanova we play a five-out, so I played 1 through 5, so I'll do whatever they need."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,MADDY SIEGRIST,"Probably like halfway through my college career is when I realized like maybe you could play in the WNBA. It probably wasn't until this year where I was like, oh, you might get picked pretty high. I don't know, I just never looked that far ahead until recently."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,I'm super excited. God is good. I got the opportunity to play professional. I appreciate the Connecticut Sun offering me and giving me the opportunity. I'm going to take full advantage of it. I'm super thankful and grateful.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,Remarkable.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Absolutely. I also have history, so I understand why teams may have been skeptical to pick me at first, but like I said earlier, I'm super grateful for the opportunity. I'm going to take full advantage. You've seen me do it with Coach Mulkey and I came out a national champion and I plan to do that in the WNBA. My will to win is incredible, and my competitive nature is unmatched. Can't be matched. I'm just grateful, man."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Yeah, he was a super villain of Superman. He was the archenemy, so yeah."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I'm not saying that. The picture has been painted that way, so I kind of just like to have fun with it and embrace it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"There's only one champ, right? There's only one champ in the room. I've been overwhelmed, but it's with positive energy, love and support. Everybody wants me to know how proud they are of me. I'm just so happy. Now I can just breathe. I can take everything all in and start preparing for what's to come."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Just showing my ability to score at this height and to be a three-level threat, not just by shooting the mid-range but knocking down threes, getting to the paint, facilitating, leading my team, and I also think by winning it helped my draft stock a lot, too. I'd just say scoring. I'm considered to be undersized, so there's more expected out of me being a smaller guard. I played up to some expectations."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I'm just going to start with Coach Mulkey. I'm just going to drag along her principles, her discipline, her structure that she supplied for the team, like being on time, being early, being the last one in the gym, tuck my jersey. The little things, I'm going to carry those small things over into the league. Because that's what's been keeping me successful this far. So if it's not broke, I don't want to -- there's nothing to fix. I'll just carry the little things over to my new organization, the Connecticut Sun."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Well, hopefully some of those followers just follow me along, and that's not to be cocky or anything, but I am a national champion, so hopefully that can bring some more attention and viewership to the league. My ultimate goal is to grow this game, and whether I'm a part of it or not, I want to make an impact on the league for the younger generations, for the women coming up under us. It's bigger than me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Okay, as far as the SEC and playing in that conference, the SEC is one of the toughest conferences I've ever played in. I've been in the Big 12, the Big Ten, and it's the physicality, the pace of the game, and just the competitiveness. The league is just special. The SEC is different."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"As a competitor and in order to keep myself motivated, you have to find little things like that. I like to find little things that keep me fueled and keep a chip on my shoulder because I feel like that's when I perform at my best."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Like I said, as far as being underrated, I really just don't care about the opinions. I know the time that I put in towards my craft."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Some people will never give me credit just for my height. She's 5-6, she's little, she's tiny. They'll never give me credit for that. They can't see past the height thing. So it's like, I don't really get into the ratings. I'm going to congratulate all of those young ladies who went before me and after me. We just made a huge accomplishment. We're living our dreams right now. But when it comes down to spots, we're all competing for one."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Oh, yeah, big day, congratulations. Go Tigers. That was one of my fellow seniors, and I'm super happy and I'm super proud for Day. She's mild, she's quiet, she's laid back, and a lot of people didn't really get to say Day perform because she was in the shadow of Angel, but I think y'all seen later on down the stretch that she was a key piece to our puzzle, and I'm so happy that she got this opportunity, of course. Thank you, Day."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,Leadership. Like learning how important leadership is in order to win at the highest levels.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I've been playing the point guard position my whole life, but I wasn't under Coach Mulkey my entire college career, and she pushes and she pulls certain things out of us that we don't even know we have in us sometimes, and I appreciate Coach for that because I value the small things. Yeah."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,I didn't speak to them before the draft but they did FaceTime me and congratulate me and I thanked them for picking me and giving me an opportunity to live my dream. I plan on calling them after I'm done with all the media and stuff just to get to know them. This is fitting to be my new home.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Go hard every day, be coachable, listen to my vets. Just go in there and compete and leave it all out there and let the pieces fall where they fall. I believe in God. I don't think He'll ever set me up to fail. He didn't bring me this far to just leave me hanging. I know He didn't do that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,I'm going to leave it all out there in training camp and let the pieces fall where they fall.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"I mean, you've always got to give credit to the legends and the people who came before you because they paved the way for me so I wouldn't have been able to see this day if they weren't my leaders and my role models. So I give a lot of credit to them. It means a lot to me. Like now I'm in that position, so now I have people looking up to me and I just am going to take what I learned from them and apply it in my own way and be a leader."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Coach Mulkey got a lot. Her pro list is about to extend. She has them coming in. Easy, yeah. She got them come in. She's going to get them."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"Because I'm hungry. I think I said this in Dallas. Like I'm just super hungry, and everything I lost, like I'm going to get it. I'm going to take it. With all respect, I lost so much from my freshman year. I know it's still out there for me to gain. That's just how I approach everything."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALEXIS MORRIS,"But always respectful, though. Always respectful, yeah, and with love."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"Yeah, Maryland was a progression. Starting freshman year, thinking I was going to be a star -- yeah, no. It definitely took a progression."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"But I think all the growing pains made me who I am today, and I'm super grateful for it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,Just a lot of hard work and determination and having a coach that is constantly attacking you to get better is something that helps you and motivates you to be who you can be.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I think just being an all-around player. I can do multiple things. I feel like I'm a three-level scorer and I also can play on both sides of the court. Yeah, I think that can help."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"Sometimes in life you don't want to stay in one place for too long. I felt like that's what I was doing if I stayed at Maryland. It would just be like because I'm scared to take the next step. I'm not scared. Transitions are always scary, don't get me wrong, but I think I'm excited and ready for a new journey in life, as well."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I think I'm just never satisfied. Even now, I know I have so much more to develop. The player you see right now or the last game I played, I'm not going to be in another two years. I'm just constantly trying to develop and be a sponge to the game and constantly find new things."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I just remember watching Maya Moore. That's some big shoes to fill, and I'm not filling her shoes by any means. I'm going to be Diamond Miller as soon as I step on the new city."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"But yeah, Cheryl, she seems tough already, so I'm really excited. We had great talks, and yeah, she's really passionate, and luckily for me, I kind of had a similar coach in college. So I think the transition of coaching styles might be the same. Super excited."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,I just want to say he's from UMD and his story of where he is right now is the reason why people keep going.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"You're one of my reasons why I keep going, just because of your situation, and I feel like we just continue to work. You can't be sad in one place for too long, and somehow you just get back up even when you're not happy with the situation."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"It's so funny that you said that because I was just thinking in my head, like what is going on right now? I'm still kind of in disbelief. But I think once everything starts settling in and I realize, okay, this is where I'm at right now, I'll be okay, but right now I still feel like a college student. I'm still in college classes. Until I think that ends, I'm going to be like, all right, I'm a pro."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,My expectations is just to be Diamond Miller every time I step on the court and to continue to be passionate and love the game the way I always did when I was a little kid. That is what I want to do.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"I just think it just shows that when you work hard, success is going to come. Obviously the journey isn't smooth sailing as you would like it to be, but when you make it, even with those hard times and the times you feel like things are hard and you make it past those moments, it makes this moment right here a little bit more special because you know how much you went through to be in this moment."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DIAMOND MILLER,"Oh, absolutely, and I think throughout my life I've always had those changes. I did USA Basketball. I went from high school to college. Transfers and stuff like that. There's always change going to come. What has to stay solid is your confidence in who you are as a person and what you bring to the table."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Just blessed more than anything, just blessed to be here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Yeah, that's something that I've always liked to pride myself on, my shooting ability and scoring ability. But I'm just excited to get to Indiana and do that, just be me basically. But yeah, I think being a little less athletic, my shooting ability has been something that's helped offset my lack of athleticism at times, but I'm also just excited to get to Indiana and be a sponge and find ways that I can get better."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"It's an incredible list of people you just named. There's also people on the list they didn't even name, Kelsey Mitchell and other people that are incredibly talented, have been veterans of the league. I'm excited to get there and pick their brains in ways that I can help add to the team and be a good addition and be a vocal leader wherever they need me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Very excited to play with her and just to get to pick her brain a little bit about the league and just her journey through the W. I got to talk to her a little bit earlier today, and she gave me some advice and told me just to enjoy the moment and just keep being me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,I've not seen that but I am very excited to see that. My hometown and home has meant a lot to me. Just being close to home with Ohio State has meant so much to have my family in my backyard. So I'm excited to be that close to home and have my family ties.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,TAYLOR MIKESELL,"Yeah, Grace is incredibly talented and we've had a lot of battles when she was at Indiana and I was at Ohio State. Even when I was at Maryland we had some battles. She's an incredible competitor, and I'm excited to be on the other end of that this time."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I want to say I'm grateful to be here. This is unbelievable for me to be doing this right now, so just very blessed."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"It feels surreal. Really didn't think I would be here one day. I've come a long way, gone through a lot of challenges, but also opportunities, and all of my steps that I've been through have led me to here. Just feels very blessed."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"A lot of people have helped me to get here. It's just a very exciting moment. My stepdad, my parents helped me every day to get here, to get to college. So I'm very grateful for them and just all the people, all the coaches, all the teammates that have trusted me along the way to get here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I think it started when I went from Fairfield to UConn, when I decided to go in the transfer portal. I heard it from other people, and I think I started believing more in myself that by competing at a high level like UConn, that could help me for my professional career. It started, yeah, I would say a year ago."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,I think that I'm just very excited to learn and to play at another level. I hope I can fit in the team that I'm going to and just learning from other experienced players and try to have an impact at some point.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"Well, first, merci. But yes, I think this year my exposure being at a bigger school helped me, I think. Having that impact that I've had all year long, it's something that is kind of crazy to realize. I'm just very happy to be able to maybe have an opportunity with the French national team, and just to be here right now is amazing."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I want to win. I've always loved to win. Whether I was in France, in Ireland, in Fairfield or UConn. My goal always is to win and always have the best experiences with my teammates. I'm a very competitive person, so I just want to win."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"It feels great. I hope to inspire a lot of other players from mid-major schools, that nothing is impossible. As cliche as it sounds, it's very true if you put the work in and if you believe. People are always going to give you opportunities, like UConn did for one year. Even if you're at a mid-major school, you can always reach higher."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LOU LOPEZ SENECHAL,"I think I do. I think this year at UConn it was a way for me to play again a faster pace, a lot of transition, a lot of motion type of offense. I think that is something that they did a lot in Europe, and I'm just very excited to transition it to the professional level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It means everything to me. I think just being able to experience this, being both of us internationals, fifth years coming from UConn, I think it's super special. I'm super happy for her. Whenever her name was called, I was super excited for her. But it's very special."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I think we had definitely a challenging season that brought us together. We were able to build that connection, that friendship that I think is going to last forever. So I couldn't be happier to have her by my side."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I'm looking forward to just going there. Obviously knowing that Napheesa Collier is there is definitely a huge excitement for me. Just learning a lot from her whenever I came to UConn, watching a lot of film on her, how can I be successful in a UConn jersey, because she was so successful already at UConn. Kind of learning a lot of things from her just watching her play. But now kind of being there and learning from her, having that leader, I'm very excited. But even just the whole organization."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I'm definitely a very competitive person. I know they are. I know they want to win a WNBA championship. I'm just excited to go there, learn from them and start to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,I believe it's not really one specific thing but more just my versatility of being able to impact the game offensively and defensively a lot of different ways.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I was able to come to UConn and have totally two different seasons. First season obviously coming off the bench, just kind of learning the ways I can impact the game, who knows in how many minutes. Some games I got a lot of minutes, some games not so much. So I had to definitely take advantage of that and learning a different role, and now this season more of a leadership role, playing heavy minutes. I was counted on more offensively, defensively."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Even just the past two years I think just prepared me for the next level and just kind of showing that versatility. And I think just going to Minnesota, I've seen a lot of similarities of how they play, how UConn plays. Seeing Napheesa playing there being so successful is definitely very exciting to me. I'm just excited to see how my game can translate into that and what I can bring to the table."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,But it's definitely just exciting to work and excited to get there and meet everybody and go to work.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"I think one of the things that definitely all of them said is just enjoy the moment. I think they told me to not stress, whether I get picked up in the first round, second round. It's definitely where you fit."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"So before I got ready it was a mix of things. The makeup artist did not believe it was my own playlist. I did my favorite karaoke song ever to ""'Cause I Love You"" by Lenny Williams, best song ever. We had some ""Sweet Thing"" by Mary J. Blige and some Anthony Hamilton. We had it all. It was a good pre-draft ready mix. Yeah, good vibes."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, the camcorder was The Players' Tribune idea to kind of accompany the podcast. So it was really fun to have it all day. When I first pulled it out, I saw Aliyah first. Her room was two doors down. She was like, girl, what are we doing today? It took me like an hour to figure it out last night. I was looking at the blue screen. Took me a minute, but it was really cool. The girls all had fun with it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"And I think for me today I tried not to let the nerves get the best of me. It was really just trying -- I can't control what's going to happen and I'm trying not to control the uncontrollables. It was being able to enjoy the moment, have my family out there, the people who mean the most to me. Just kind of sink into the moments and have a good time."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"A lot excites me. I think especially just it's a young group, and with good veteran pieces, as well, but I'm excited just to get to work. They have the new ownership group that's been in place the past few years, new coaches. So I think they're building a really great team right now. They had a great season last year with that young group."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"So I'm excited to join it. I think I can impact the team in different ways. So just getting to Atlanta, getting to it, it's a homecoming in a way. All of my mom's family is from Georgia. So, I know my phone is blowing up right now. Probably lots of missed calls. So I'm excited to get out there and just get to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, I'm used to being in charge with the questions, so not being ready for what you guys are going to say is a little nerve-racking, but I now see how my guests feel. But it's fun to be on the other side of things is what I started off doing."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"It's amazing. Every day at practice in high school I saw D-Rob up on the wall. So now that I get join her on a team with a Mitty legend, it's hard to describe really. It's something that I looked up to. She was the first Mitty legend in the women's basketball program. So now to get to play alongside her is kind of amazing. I don't really have any other words to describe it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I think I'm just looking to come in -- the way that I've grown a lot from my freshman year until now is I've become I think more outspoken. I like to advocate for things, just kind of be myself, be genuine, authentic. As I move into the league, I look to do the same things on the court, being open and honest with my teammates, being a sponge, ready to learn. Then off the court speaking up for what I believe in. If changes need to be made, I'm not afraid to say what I think, have the tough conversations, be in those rooms and push the league to the next level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,And I think everybody ahead of me has done an amazing job of blazing the trail now that now I get to be a part of. Just continuing to keep the torch flowing and push it on to the next generation behind me.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I'm jealous it's still bright there on the West Coast. But I think at Stanford I went through a lot of different things. I had an injury my freshman year and then it was COVID season and we won. I've won three Pac-12 championships, two Final Fours. It's a lot of winning."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Just kind of having that be the standard, I think I'm going to be able to just bring that energy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"But I've learned a lot. I've learned how to work with different types of people, how to create relationships off the court, team chemistry, how to have tough conversations, get the best out of your teammates. I think I can bring a lot of different things, but I'm really excited to get to Atlanta, meet my new teammates and just get busy, I guess."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Just excitement really. I'm excited to join the league. I think that there's so much talent across the league already, and all the draftees. So just to get my name called sixth pick is amazing. It's just full of excitement. There weren't really any predictions on where I was going to go. I wasn't going to guess I was going to go someplace and be disappointed. I was just excited for whatever team called my name, and I'm going to take that and get to work there and give that organization all that I have."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"A lot of people did talk about what I can't do, downsides of my game, whatever it may be. I think that I just kind of took that and there are so many other things that I bring to the game, but it's also something that I don't feel like I have a lack of. I think it just wasn't really my role and where I was. But if that's something that's going to be asked of me, I'm going to do what I've always done and make the best of my role and impact the game in every way that I can, which I think is in all facets, whether I'm rebounding and running, I'm playing off the block, playing off the wing, setting the screen, coming off the screen, whatever it may be. So I think if that's going to be asked of me, I've been working, I'm prepared to get there to the league and shake things up."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I think people are going to pick and choose what to focus on, but I know what I bring to the table, and I'm excited to get to Atlanta and show them why they picked me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, I'm really excited. I feel like it's something that I've worked for all my life. I'm really excited to carry the torch that my cousin DeLisha had, next one in the family to get to the league, and I'm going to try to make my impact in whichever I can."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I'm really excited to get there and learn. There's so many amazing veteran players. The Dream staff is very experienced and they have a lot of wisdom that they are going to pass down to me. I'm excited for training camp. I'm sure I'm going to be tested. I'm sure there's going to be a reality check there, but I'm just going to take it in stride and pick up any ounce that I can to just get better."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, Laeticia said it best. We both come from winning programs and a standard of excellence, and I think that the Dream is putting that into place right now. So for us to bring our collegiate experience of winning to the next level, it's going to be great. We have a lot to learn, as well, but I think we can bring some pieces of knowledge and just kind of bring the same work ethic that we had in college and just boost that to be even greater, it's really exciting."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"You mentioned Laeticia, we've been rivals for like four years now. So we ran into each other in the photo room. So we're excited to finally get to play together, throw on the same jersey, and I think we'll be quite the duo to throw up with people like Naz Hillmon, Danielle Robinson, Rhyne Howard. The list goes on and on. I'm excited to get there and play with everyone."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I mean, I don't really pay very much attention to the projections and things. I was just kind of excited to get to the league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"But to your point about three-point shooting and things of this sort, I'm just excited to get to the next level and show what I've been working on. I think at Stanford it wasn't really my role to three-point shoot, it was to play-make, rebound and run, facilitate, run the offense, play out of the high post. And I think when that was my given role, I played it to the highest extent that I could. We did a lot of great things doing that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Now I was a great three-point shooter in high school, and I think now it's just kind of bringing that back to the arsenal. I don't think it ever really left, it's just bringing it back to the forefront. It's been on standby for a while."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I'm excited to get to the A, bring it there, and you know, just kind of prove people wrong in a way, I guess."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,But that's not really me focus. My focus is on getting to Atlanta and winning basketball games.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Yeah, when I heard ATL and they said ""Haley Jones,"" I was like, let's get it, that was kind of my attitude about it. I was like, let's get to it. Give my family the hugs, I'm excited to get there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"But with the young core, I think they bring a lot of different things, but I think what I can bring on the court, people always talk about my versatility, so I think that's going to be big at the next level. Being a 6-1 point guard is huge. The vision that you have, the mismatches that you can exploit in a variety of ways, I think being able to rebound the ball and push it and not look for an outlet gives a different look to the game."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"I think off the court I try to just be myself and people usually describe that as compassionate, a lot of times goofy, maybe clumsy, but I think I'm going to bring an authenticity about myself. I'm never going to apologize for who I am. The way that I am, I'm proud of who I've become. I'm just going to bring a confident energy, one that's going to look to have fun, make the game fun because that's what it should be. That's why we all play. I'm excited to bring that big ol' personality that I have to Atlanta."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"Oh, my God. Hopefully she's listening or going to see this interview. I'm so sorry. I literally got called. Didn't even think to grab my phone. I hugged my mom and dad, my brother. So when I get to my phone I will call her back immediately. That is like the worst first impression to have is missing a call from your new boss."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,HALEY JONES,"The second I get to my phone, no matter how many missed calls I have, missed texts, calling her immediately. But I hope she knows how excited I am to get to the A, make an impact, get to training camp, just get ready to work. I will tell her profusely all of that as soon as we get on the phone."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"I think definitely just my hard work, my work ethic, going in I'm a competitor. No one likes to lose, but just going in, I want to get rebounds, I'm aggressive on the boards, just being versatile, being able to score on all three levels. That's kind of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, it's really exciting getting drafted to the Dallas Wings but to know that Steph Stephanie Soares is also going to be there. I got to play with her a little bit this year. So getting the opportunity to play with her again is really exciting because obviously with her injury this year, I didn't get to play with her the full year, but she has a lot of potential and is a great player, a great person. So I'm excited to get to play with her again."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, it's a great question. I think the biggest thing is just learning to compete through challenges. Obviously, we faced a lot of adversity this year with Steph going out, Coach Fennelly had lost his mom. We had a lot of changes within the program, and so just learning to fight through adversity. Continuing to battle and kind of adapt to the changes, but also just learning how to handle the ball a little better, again, scoring on all three levels. I think all of those things helped translate and are able to help me as I move forward here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, definitely you get a little anxious waiting and you want to know where you're going, but really exciting when you hear your name called and you get to go up on stage, take your picture and get to know where you're going now, and obviously with Steph going there, it's really exciting I get to play with her again."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, I'm super excited to get there. Training camp is going to be tough, but nothing is ever easy. Nothing is ever handed to you. You have to work for it. You have to earn it. Just coming in being aggressive and competitive, competing and just soaking it all up, learning from the veteran players and going from there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, it's really exciting when you hear your name called. You're happy. It's just all the emotions kind of rush to you at once, and you're just excited to get the opportunity to be here, get drafted. Obviously, it's a hard league, and to even be drafted is hard, but making a roster is the next stop."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"Yeah, I've never been the biggest or the strongest person on the court, but you have to have the heart and the will to go after the ball. Just kind of knowing when a shooter shoots it, where the ball is going to come off the rim, kind of reading it that way, and going after the ball and just being competitive and battling inside, even if you're not the biggest. I think that's what helps me rebound a lot."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Man, surreal. It's a surreal feeling. Just thankful to God. I give all glory to Him. I wouldn't be here without Him. All the hard work that I've put in allowed me to be in this position. Like I said, I'm just grateful for this opportunity."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I can be a lockdown defender. Like you said, I'm pretty versatile. Can't really put me in a box. I'm going to do whatever it takes. Whatever the team needs I'm going to do it. I work hard. I'm a big guard so I can guard fours, bigger guards, smaller guards. Like I said, I'm really focusing in on bringing that defensive impact."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I was literally just talking to Tamika Catchings. The first time she texted me I was star struck. I was like, this is Tamika Catchings, she has my number, she knows my name, what the heck."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"But no, she's been there. She's been giving me advice and encouraging me. I'm so thankful for her."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"She just told me to be me. She said she knew that I would make it. Just continue to do the things that I've been doing, and she's rooting for me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, I mean, either way it went, I feel like it was going to be a good situation. It was two really good situations. That's why it made it even harder for me to decide. But to go back on everything that I've worked for is for this moment."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I've always had aspirations and dreams of playing in the W. I've watched it growing up. I feel like this is my time. God was giving me this opportunity, and I feel like I had to jump on it. I'm honestly so happy that I made this decision. I'm a strong believer in everything happens for a reason, and this was meant to happen."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Ooh, I'm excited to play with all my teammates at Seattle. We've got another Tennessee Lady Vol over there Mercedes Russell, so I'm excited about that. And then just stepping out on the court and playing against everybody. Like I said, I'm a big fan of the W. I watched it growing up all my life. So I look up to a lot of people in the W. Every team that I play against, I'm just honored to be out there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Things really set in after my name was called. I was walking out and my nerves were high. I walked out and they pulled me over and they showed my this video of my aunt or my cousin Sylvia. She coached for North Carolina and also played in the W. She showed me this video of her speaking and it kind of made me tear up. Just realizing this is what I've worked for. She's always told me that I had what it takes to be in the W, and it's just crazy that it's finally here."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I'm so excited to pick her brain. I'm so excited for her to take me in and to be a part of this. They have a great fan base. I'm just excited to get out there. Like I said, I'm always ready to learn, and I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help this team."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Well, actually Seattle was probably one of the only places that I didn't have a conversation with. I've talked with a lot of coaches on Zoom, and they was actually one of the ones that I didn't. I'm so thankful that they saw potential in me. But like I said, they come from rich history. Sue Bird, she held it down there. Jewell Loyd, she's a dog. I'm just really excited."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"I'm just going to do whatever I need to do. I'm going to continue to be me, be a great teammate, be a sponge, be ready to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"None. I had no idea where I was going. The city was beautiful. It was amazing. The only thing that I've known about Seattle prior to going for the NCAA Tournament was Grey's Anatomy. I only knew it was a pretty beautiful city. But no, I did not have any clue on where I was going to end up."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,I'm excited to embark on that new journey.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yes, actually I did. Yeah, I did talk to all the coaches. We got on the phone. They were excited, I was excited. Just made me want to go there right now."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Honestly, the whole draft I could see Coach. She was in the corner. I'm over here, hands, palms sweating. Every time I would look at Coach, it calmed me down. I would just look over at Coach, she would be just looking around and I was like, all right, I'm good, I'm good. But that goes to show you she brings me peace. I can be myself with her, and I love her so much. She's done so much for me, and whatever I can do to give back to her, I'm going to jump and do it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Definitely playing at Tennessee has prepared me for the next level. You look at Tennessee, you see Candace Parker, you see legends that come out of Tennessee. I feel like just having those people that came before us, they came back and helped us out. I feel like that's been a good thing. I feel like also with the coaching staff, they were amazing on and off the court. I feel like they're the best in the country."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"As far as Mercedes, I haven't spoken to her, but I'm going to get on that real soon. I remember coming on a visit, I don't remember how old I was, but she was there and I was looking up to her. So I'm excited to play with her."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Man, it's crazy. I still can't even believe it. Like I said, I have to give all glory to God because without Him I wouldn't be here. My family, the people who supported me, like I said, it's still a blur. I probably won't even realize this until long, long, long down the line. So I'm just trying to take everything in, but I'm just so grateful."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Okay, so we actually we actually made that handshake maybe a week before the draft. We were like, we're going to be one of those cool people, like we're going to do a handshake. We showed everybody in the office, so we probably did it about 12 times."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,But it was cool. I think we looked pretty cool. We pulled it off.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"And then Rennia texted me today just telling me she was proud of me and she was rooting for me. But that just goes to show that the sisterhood is real. We stay in touch. Like I said, I look up to them. They brought me in and they showed the ropes to me, and hopefully I was able to do that with somebody else. But like I said, it's a sisterhood, and it means more here at Tennessee."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Do you think so? I mean, it's nothing too crazy. Actually, it was just thrown together last minute. I got it yesterday. I didn't want anything too crazy, but I needed something that had to make a statement. I feel like this was the right fit for me. I think I pulled it off."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's great to be here. This is, I think, one of the most exciting nights on the WNBA calendar. We're going to watch a group of extremely talented athletes really get ready to start the next phase of their basketball journey. I've had such fun with them today and also had fun calling them all."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Thank you. So there's no one that wants the full season and full playoffs more than I do. But again, as I said and the question is the right one, talk about how do you build a sustainable model to fund it. Because remember, travel is an operating expense. It's an operating expense on your budgets and your company's budgets and an operating expense on our budget. It's not something typically you can go out and get funded through either equity investment, debt investment. It has to come from the revenues of the company. Every place I've ever worked, every client I ever served in my prior life, that's how you fund operating expenses. So it has to come from revenue and revenue growth, if you're going to expand it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I feel comfortable we've been growing revenue at the league, which is why I feel comfortable with this particular program this year, and yes, in the longer term, as we look at a next media rights deal, as we get more corporate partners and more significant amounts as we drive the valuation of our franchises up. You saw the news when Seattle did their capital raise this year, they had a post-money evaluation of 150 million. That's being driven by their revenue, which is being driven by the lift that we're all seeing and the momentum in women's sports. This is how you fund things like this is, build a revenue model, take a look at expenses, too, but have enough dropped to the bottom line that you feel comfortable funding something for a decade or more."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That's how we're looking at all of our expenses, not just charter travel but all travel experiences, because there's other things the players would want, too, as they travel that we'll take a look at over time."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, we intend to do more, as I said, the release said. But we do need some patience and time to build it so that we feel comfortable funding something more substantial as we get into our ensuing years."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now, next year will be a challenge because it's an Olympic year. So that's always a challenge because we have to take a month off or approximately a month off from the league as we support our national team players, not just in the USA women's national team but also -- I think last year we had 23 players from 13 different foreign countries. This year, obviously rosters aren't set yet, and when we get that number we'll provide it. But we're globalizing our player population, as well, and when you think about what that means going forward."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to continuing the conversation, but it'll always be on the list for me until we get the full program."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, thanks. So there's a lot being obviously talked about and written, and what a great day to be talking all the time about the momentum and players staying, players coming. I think we have a fabulous draft class this year. Everyone we were kind of looking at to come into the league, and I think our general managers were looking at, is in this draft class this year. Obviously, there were a few that decided to stay."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Look, I was a Division I both college basketball player and lacrosse player. If I could've played for one more year -- by the way, if I could go back and play today at the age of 58, I would go back and play today. I totally understand it. I understand the opportunities to stay in college."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But I think, again, we're going to have such depth in our next few draft classes, so I'm not worried about the extra COVID year. I think next year technically is the last year of the extra COVID year, and so if players decide to stay, I think some players were looking at where they might fall in the draft class and things like that. I think it's great that we have these options and the depth in this league and the quality of play in this league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Just on your question of coming off the outstanding March Madness tournament, I was in Dallas. It was amazing. It was everything you thought it was going to be but more. And then the viewership being on ABC on Sunday -- we do so great when we're on ABC, as well, at the WNBA. But we do need to do, as I've stood up here and said before, a great job of taking kind of these really star players who have huge followership, whether through their NIL deals or just through their social media following."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Remember, the NIL deals have been actually a positive for players coming into our league if they have national brands like Gatorade and Nike. They're our partners, too. They can come in with those NIL deals and then they can get activated even more broadly because those are our deals."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now when they are local deals for just the local area, maybe that is not as relevant. But certainly these national NIL deals -- I was wrong about that. I thought it's just another area for women to be undervalued in sports, but I was wrong about that because the NCAA women's basketball players have been highly successful in signing these NIL deals. I think it's a huge positive for us."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So we'll welcome them in and especially them building their personal brands. They come in with a huge following, social media following, and look at some of these generational players that are going to come in the next two years."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think the attention on the women's basketball game, I went from the Final Four in Dallas to the Masters. Everybody at the Masters was talking about women's basketball. It was pretty incredible."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Now we have to make sure we take these great players and as they come into our league we continue to market them, put the marketing dollars behind them. I know Phil Cook, our CMO, is working very hard on making sure that integration from NCAA into the WNBA is something that we can take advantage of that momentum, rather than what we might have done in prior years, which is okay, now they're in our league and they're on a team where you don't have the loyalty of that college town following them. Now we've got to bring those fans along with us."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think the attention this year on the March Madness tournament for the women's national champion -- think about LSU and 102 points. How many points were scored by the winning team in the men's final? 76. Think about that, nearly 30 more points in the same amount of time scored by LSU, and just what a great testament to the quality of the game and these players coming into our league."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Great. As soon as I give a timetable, I assure you it won't be right. So I'm not going to give a timetable. We might have been talking about it, but as you know I have a philosophy that we needed to have more transformation of the league economics because the last thing we want to do is bring new owners in who are going to fail. I had a philosophy, and I think it was the right one because I think the valuations are going up for all of our teams and all of our assets. Because it's not just about a valuation of the franchise. It's the patch on the uniform, it's a placement on the courts, it's an ad buy, it's a media right fee -- all the things that new owners coming into the league from these cities that we think will be great cities for the WNBA will benefit from."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I am so glad we didn't rush it. Yes, now it's time to really get into the due diligence phase with some of these cities, some of these ownership groups. Start deciding on what an expansion draft might look like. We've got great drafts coming up in the next few years."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As I said, yes, I'd love to bring in at least two teams over the next few years and maybe longer term four. So that's where we are today, and that's what we're working on."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so I'm glad you just used that word ""unique,"" because I think her situation is unique. I was able to spend about two and a half hours with Brittney about a month or so ago, talking with her about her return to the league, talking about physical, mental, all the things. Obviously, her story is going to be incredible when she chooses to share it. She is just inspiring. That's all I'll say."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, we've been working substantially with our security experts, with the Phoenix Mercury, with Brittney's team about -- given her unique conditions -- some things that we'll do this year. By nature of the fact that it's a security plan, it'll be confidential. We're not going to share the details of that security plan. Obviously, people will know where she's playing and when. But we'll keep those -- rest assured, we're working on it because it is a unique situation. I think we all want to protect all of our players. So we're looking at additional security for all of our players, not just Brittney, but Brittney definitely being a unique case this year."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,We've worked on that plan and we're putting some finishing touches as we get into training camp and then into the regular season. Thank you.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's a great question. We're often asked about that roster size question. We think today our rosters are the right size. We've talked obviously with the Players Association about that. We've talked about the 22-year age. We've talked about a lot of different things, as we're thinking about the league quite differently than we thought about it in the past."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think for now the roster sizes are set for this season into next. But that'll be for sure a discussion in the next round of collective bargaining, as will a variety of other issues. And I think with expansion on the horizon, my personal view is to give 12 to 24 and hopefully more roster spots will be something obviously that expansion will afford us. So to do something shorter term with roster size for the 12 teams versus bringing in 24 new players or opportunities for 24 players, I think is the right answer. It helps, again, extend us into two new cities where you expand fandom. And that just all is part of transforming and growing the league versus adding a spot here or there, which actually doesn't do any of that, quite frankly."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It does give a few opportunities to a few more players, but I think in this case we're looking to expand the opportunities for players broadly. One of the ways to do that is expansion. So that's what we'll be looking at in the future."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So obviously one thing I learned in my prior life, where I had to conduct a lot of investigations, is that these things do take time. The investigation is ongoing. We'll definitely share an update when it's ready. I am letting the lawyers do their work. So no update at this time, but the investigation is ongoing. No timeline, either, because again, depending on the outcome of the investigation, but we will share the findings when we've completed the investigation."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so the overall draft class, I think the quality of the draft class is outstanding. The personalities of this draft class, as I've learned today by spending the day off and on with them, is great. I think you're going to see obviously there's -- you all have your mock drafts and I know you know these players and what they're capable of on the court. I think you're going to see them integrate and assimilate into the league very quickly. I think you're going to see a lot of them fighting for starting positions."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think it's going to be a tough choice on Rookie of the Year already this year. I'm going to tell each of them when I come up and read their names that their goal is to get into training camp, work hard and make a roster and ultimately get a starting position, and I think you'll see that in this class this year. They're really, really a talented class."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, all the discussion on roster sizes and expansion, but you want to make sure you're doing it not in just adding, adding, adding, just because you don't want to degrade the quality of the game. That's one that's important to protect. I don't think the quality has ever been better in this game right now, the women's game, both at the collegiate and at the professional level. That's why I think this draft class is going to be great and the next few years is going to be great."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But we've got some veterans out there vying for same roster spots, who are playing at the highest level of their game, as well. It's going to be an interesting season to see what's happening with the teams and the free agency and now these rookies coming in fighting for those spots. I think it's going to be great."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, again, I do think we'd love to have a resolution prior to the season tip. Again, I'm letting the lawyers do their work. That's what a commissioner should do. These things do take time. But I agree -- I don't disagree that it would be important to get a resolution by the season tip. We're working hard on that. These are complicated investigations typically that require a lot of time and interviews of a lot of different people."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, and just to the competitive balance thing, I think everybody is talking about the two super teams out there. But I see some teams -- we're going to have a ton of competitive balance in this league this year and a ton of parity, just like the college game had this year with No. 1 seeds losing. That didn't happen in the women's game five, ten years ago. Just really proud of the product that's on the court right now, both at the collegiate level and as a feeder system into the WNBA."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, the number one thing to capitalize on the momentum is to continue the plan around marketing the players into household names and building rivalries."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We have an enormous opportunity this year to build fandom around rivalries in this league, so no matter which team a fan might be following, we've got to build compelling content so that that rivalry or those players that you follow are part of what you want to do every other night or every third night as these players get on the court and we get the viewership and we get the fans in the seats."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That's the number one thing, especially in advance of thinking about all the disruption in the broadcast and media world around linear, around streaming. Streamers are being disrupted because they were disrupting linear. Households using TVs, people using TVs are going down, but what does that mean? More people are using the devices that they have to stream games, and we've got to be in that game, as well. Those are all the things that we need to capitalize on the momentum."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"There's no doubt like what just happened with the NCAA and the number of viewers for both that Friday night, the Sunday night and just the enormous capitalization on people waking up to say, this game is great, and people now who have watched it, they'll come back."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's an excellent question and one where clearly Becky is setting the stage as a role model, especially given her number of years in the NBA as an assistant coach and then coming to the WNBA as a head coach and winning the championship, the WNBA Finals her first year."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really an important question as you think about, but I think a rising tide lifts all boats in this area, especially when you look at the compensation of coaches and assistant coaches."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're so proud of the diversity we're achieving in our coach and assistant coach -- nine out of 12 of our head coaches are now women, and 77 percent of our assistant coaches are women. Of that, 70 percent are women of color or people of color. Really just an amazing transformation of that part of the league, the diversity and that pipeline to feed into becoming the next head coaches, whether it's in the WNBA, which I hope, or even in the college game, where they struggle a little more with women coaches more broadly, given our numbers."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With Bethany Donaphin's leadership about diversity and coaching, we've really made enormous strides in a short period of time that I didn't think were possible. Those numbers I threw out were proof that you can build a pipeline of diverse coaches who are going to really be the future of this game from a coaching perspective and then pay them. That's how I think our owners are thinking of it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,Right. I remember the first time I did it was in my living room with my two children as my stagehands. Literally we were steaming in my dryer the jerseys right before because they came all wrinkled in a box. It's really good to be here in New York City at Spring Studios. It's really going to be fun.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But personally for me, calling those players, as I said in my lead-in, calling them, having the excitement in their voices that you are going to make their dreams come true. I met their parents and their families today, as well, in a session, and they're so excited. Just to see that you can have that impact and that then they're a role model for future girls and boys to look up to. Favorite part of the job without a doubt. Handing out the WNBA Finals trophy is great, and the rings. But this night is unique because it's a new chapter in all of the lives of these 36 players who will be drafted tonight."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Definitely excited, as you can tell in my voice."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"It's a beautiful feeling. I wasn't able to watch the whole draft, but I know my teammates got drafted. So huge testament to Coach for being able to bring all these great girls together and make history and now we're all living our dream. I'm excited and I can't wait to see what the future holds for all of us."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"To find the beauty in your struggle and embrace your journey. I think once I was able to do that, things started to open up for me in the best way possible. I was able to maintain. I was able to stay consistent. I was just happy me. Definitely finding beauty in my journey and just embracing it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"Yes, Toledo, Ohio, huge ""thank you"" to you guys for supporting me. My city is behind me. They are behind me. I'm going to be so far away, but I know in my heart they're going to be so close. So thank you to Toledo, Ohio. Thank you to Toledo Rogers for leading the way for me and just sticking behind me. It's not over with, Toledo. We're still in it. So let's continue to do what we do."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"This is definitely a dream come true. This is something that I've prepared myself for since I was six years old. I would tell my younger self, I would actually congratulate her. I would tell her how proud I am of her for listening to her parents, number one, for not being a follower, being a leader and being very hardworking. I never quit on myself. I'm definitely very proud of myself."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"I definitely know that they're rebuilding a little bit. I got a chance to talk to the staff, and I fell in love with their staff at first sight. Head coach is amazing. Coaching staff is amazing. So I can't wait to get a chance to go out there. They got some good vets there that I know are going to put me under their wing. I'm ready to learn. I'm ready to win and just do whatever I can do to help the team succeed and do what we can do."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"Yeah, that's going to be crazy. My teammates are a lot bigger than me, so they spared me a lot. But I know when they're playing against me, they won't spare me. In practice I got spared, but I think playing against them, they're definitely going to show me that they're there. I probably won't be guarding them. So I'm going to make sure my teammates lock them up, because it won't probably be me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,But I'm excited for all of us. Everything we've been able to accomplish. I know the sky's the limit for all of us.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"I know that hard work won't be a problem for me. What it'll be for me is just make sure I'm asking questions and taking pride in it. I'm going to be a rookie, but I definitely want to use the vets in the best way possible by learning from them, asking them to watch film with me, asking them to work out with me and just taking it all in for those two weeks."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"Of course I want to make the team, but I definitely want to get as much knowledge as I can. Hopefully when it's all over, I'll be on the team for sure."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ZIA COOKE,"I won't even have to keep her in my head because I know she's a call away. So if I'm feeling anything, I know I can call her and cry. I know I can call her and express how I'm feeling. I know she's going to always be here for me. I'm definitely excited to know that I was coached by somebody that will be here for the rest of my life, and I love her for that for sure."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"I mean, it's just really special. I'm thankful, first, to God just for putting me in this position but also thankful to everybody in Indiana, just because they saw something in me and I'm just ready to get there and get to work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, we talked quite a few times. She was super excited to get to know me. She was very welcoming, and I got to talk to the entire staff, and it just almost made me feel at home even before this was a real reality. So, I'm just really thankful to everybody there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, I mean, first off, everybody that has a COVID year definitely has a tough choice because you could either be somewhere where you've known the system, you've been there for four years or however many years it may be versus coming into this new system, grown-ups and it's almost like you're starting over."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"It took a lot of thought because if I could go back to South Carolina again, I absolutely would because it was so much fun. But I just knew I had to do what was best for me, and I definitely think just coming to the league, and I say that just because I've always wanted to do this. I've always wanted to be a professional basketball player and I just felt like this moment was right."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Usually if I feel any doubt, if I feel any second-guessing, I can say I'm just not going to do it. But I was just very confident in myself, so I didn't want to make a different decision because I'm going to trust my gut."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"She was like, we're reunited and we're teammates again, and I was like, and it feels so good. You know the song? That's really what it was."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,Honestly super excited to be with Henni again. It was really great playing with her in South Carolina. To already have that type of connection I think it really is just going to help us.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, just being able to learn from everyone that's there already, that includes the rookies from last year, because they already have that pro life experience, so just being able to learn from them. But also to kind of be who I am and just continue to compete. I think everybody on the Fever now they're going to compete, and we're going to work hard. I'm just really excited to get that started with everyone."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"You know, she's helped a lot. I think she's just helped me be the player that I am right now. Over the past four years she has been able to help guide my steps into what it is to be a pro, guide my habits, and for her to be in the crowd with the rest of our South Carolina crew is just amazing."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Just being confident and also being confident in your leadership skills. I think that's going to be the biggest thing, making sure I'm able to use my voice, talk about what I'm seeing on the court just so I can be able to help my teammates. But also just the physicality that I bring, trying to just be a dominant post player."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"It feels good. I'm excited to get in that Fever jersey, get with my teammates and really get to work. I think it's going to be an exciting season."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, just the way that we compete and the way that we work. I think we have all just put in a lot of work. God has really blessed us, bringing us all together at South Carolina, and for us all to be at this draft is just something that's really special, and it's honestly a dream come true because everyone that's here, not just on South Carolina, has put in so much work."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"So, Coach Staley and the entire staff has helped us. They developed us into the players that we are, so it's exciting for it all to be coming together."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"I mean, maybe in a sense, but I think it's almost like coming from high school into college because you're new and everybody already has experience, whether it's a new coach or not. I think it's going to be a little bit different that I'm going to have to adjust to, but I definitely think the coaches are going to be able to help me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, it feels really great to be in the league playing against the best women's basketball players ever, and I really just hope to continue to grow the Fever basketball. I think we're going to do really great things this year, and I'm just super excited for it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"I'm pretty confident just because of just simply spacing. I think it's going to allow me to be able to work a little bit better. Just being able to watch the pros prior to joining the league you can just see how they can just get to work, whether they make the shot or not. But just to be able to have that, it's going to be pretty nice, I think."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Honestly, every single person. One, because I don't want anybody specific coming for me, but two, just because this has been a dream of mine. So, to be able to compete against people that have a lot of experience, they can only help me grow. So, I'm really excited for that because I've always dreamt of this. So, to be able to be here, be in this moment and almost be on the court with them is pretty crazy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"Yeah, I'm going to be excited just to do that, but at the same time, we're on the court, so I definitely want to compete and make it really hard for her, but it's pretty cool to play against people that you look up to, and Candace is somebody that I look up to all the time. So, I'm really excited for that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"It's really special. I think it's just cool to see everybody not just cheering me on but the entire team, everybody that's here getting drafted, cheering us on. It just feels nice to have a good group of people behind you that want to see you succeed."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"That's a great question. Just knowing me, I would say winning every single game, and I still think that can happen. I think we're going to have a great team that's going to compete. We're going to continue to play for each other."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ALIYAH BOSTON,"So just getting a lot of wins. I think that's the most important part, but also growing as players."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"So I'll answer the Walnut question. Walnut is my dog. He's getting boarded right now. So he's not very happy that he wasn't invited to New York with me, so I'll have to buy him some Fever gear to make up for it."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I mean, in terms of what I can bring to Indiana, I just feel like I don't know what skills necessarily are going to translate anything like that, but I do know that my passion for the game, my competitiveness, my grittiness and my willingness to do whatever the team needs on any given night will be there and that will translate. I'm excited to get there and see what my coaches want from me and do that to the best of my ability."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, first off, as a team we were -- the first No. 1 seed ever for our team. We won the most games and everything like that. So we were just, I think, set the program up for a lot of really good success in the future, which means a lot to me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I think as an individual, I was just able to kind of become more mature in my skill set. I played a lot at the point guard this year, which I hadn't in previous years. So I think I was able to just fine tune some of those skills, the leadership aspects, the handling the offense, really having the ball in your hands a lot."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,I think it was the right decision for me.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I didn't really know what it would feel like. I knew it would be amazing, but I think I was just more -- just really grateful and full of emotion when I heard my name called, especially being there with my dad, who had been taking me to Indiana Fever games since I was six, seven, eight years old. It was just two hours up the road from Louisville, Kentucky, where I'm from. We got to go to those games and watch Tamika Catchings, watch Katie Douglas, watch them win that championship."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"To get called was surreal but to get called by a team you've been going to with your dad since you were really little, I think just made it that much more special."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I think it would mean a lot to me. I think I was able to win a good amount in college, so I can bring some of those characteristics over, but I really think looking at that roster, some of the young talent on it, that's super exciting. You obviously have Aliyah Boston, who we all know is amazing and going to have a great impact on the team. And then NaLyssa Smith, Queen Egbo, Destanni Henderson. The list goes on and on. To be able to play with that much talent, that much young talent and come in with them and learn from them and grow with them, I think it's something that I'm really excited about."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I knew the Fever were a team that obviously just playing in Indiana for the past five years, the community is so special for me. The community is so excited about women's basketball. I was really sad to leave Indiana, but now obviously I'm staying here, so I'm super grateful for that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Like I said earlier, my dad would take me to probably four or five games every summer of the Fever. So I think just to be able to see those strong women, like I mentioned, Tamika Catchings, Katie Douglas, Briann January, see how hard they competed, how tough they were, how much passion they had for the game, I think I modeled myself off of them and it was huge and very instrumental in the development of my own game."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"I mean, it was unbelievable to have her here. She means the world to me. She means so much to me, and I can't even begin to state how much of an impact she's had on obviously the player I am but the person I am, the woman I am to where I feel really prepared entering this next phase of my life because I've had five years under the best coach, the best leader, the best strong woman that I could possibly look up to."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"To be able to share a night with her, it was just really special."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, this was the first year that I was the main point guard on the floor. I had the ball in my hands the most. I was running the offense, getting my teammates where they needed to be. Then obviously just the leadership aspect on both ends of the floor that comes with that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"So I think just fine tuning those point guard skills, using my voice, getting my teammates where they need to be and really being that extended coach on the floor were the main things."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I think one of the things that was the most special to me in my five years at Indiana was just to see the excitement in the community of women's basketball grow, to where I'm at now, and it just seems like obviously people are crazy about basketball in Indiana, but they're crazy about women's basketball in Indiana."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"We were able to kind of build that fan base at Indiana that was so special to me, and then obviously at the professional level I think that excitement just takes a next step up."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Hopefully we have a lot of Indiana Hoosier women's basketball fans there now during the summertime, huge Indiana Fever fans."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, first of all, as a point guard, who wouldn't want to have Aliyah Boston to pass to in the post? That's about as much of an automatic bucket as you can get. I've played with her before at USA Basketball, and I think obviously we all know what she can bring on the court, but just the person that she is off the court, how much she loves the game, how genuine of a person she is, how kind of a person she is. I just couldn't ask for a better person to go on this journey with."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,To say I'm excited to be her teammate is definitely an understatement.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, obviously the mid-range is my favorite shot. Anybody that watches me knows that. But I think a part of my game that I've always known I could be good at is finishing at the rim. I worked countless hours with Coach Box, our assistant coach at Indiana, on different finishes, getting to a spot and finishing over bigger, stronger, quicker defenders. Obviously you can't be a one-dimensional player at the next level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,So me getting all the way to the rim in addition to my mid-range and my three is just going to hopefully serve me well in terms of making a roster and contributing.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"Just my ability to learn. I think that's the biggest compliment when it comes to me, being able to take in things and listen and just being able to adapt, do things that coaches need from me, teammates need from me. So being able to be in all different aspects."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"It definitely shows the hard work that I've put in. Especially coming into college. you're expecting to score, you're expecting to be the leading scorer of a team because that's what you're used to. Just being able to establish another role and be great at that and build all-around character, it shows my growth, my discipline and my patience. Just to see that the Minnesota Lynx was able to see that, it's a blessing to be there."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"Just to begin with, she's somebody we trusted. She's been through it all, many years of basketball. Her knowledge is through the roof, so we trust everything she says. For her to have four of us here, it shows that we trust her, we believed in her and she believed in us throughout the whole entire way."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,BREA BEAL,"Mainly being able to balance both. You get so caught up in getting stops and whatever the case may be and only taking one or two shots per quarter because you're just so caught up in getting those stops. Just being levelheaded when there are games where I'm scoring and making plays, and on the other end I'm being passive on defense. So just being able to balance out."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"It's an amazing experience really because this group of girls have been through life together. These four years haven't been only about basketball, but it's about growing as women together. Being able to be with them on one of our biggest nights has just been an amazing experience."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Yeah, so I've been in a background where winning has been my culture. I've been winning for most of my life. Obviously very successful at South Carolina. I want to bring that winning culture to Atlanta. I know that that is their plan. That is what they're trying to do. They're on the rise right now, and that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to bring a winning culture into the program."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Yeah, Atlanta is a great city. I love Atlanta. It's only about three and a half hours from South Carolina. So I know the Gamecocks are going to show up loud and proud."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Rhyne is a phenomenal player. Obviously she was in the SEC and I had multiple opportunities playing against her, and I also played against her in high school. Just a phenomenal player, and I'm excited to finally be with her instead of playing against her. So it'll be exciting."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Coach Staley is a phenomenal coach. I mean that wholeheartedly, not just for her coaching style, but as a person she cares so deeply for us. When I came here I had a vision, but she also had a vision for me. She said, L.A., don't worry. That's what she would always say, because obviously I'm not getting as many minutes as I would at a different program. She said, L.A., don't worry, I got you. She stood with that promise, and I'm here now because of her and because of the coaching staff that believed in me."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,I'm so thankful for who she is and what she has done for my journey.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Wow, I did not know that. That is amazing to hear."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Playing on the national team, playing for Canada has been something that I take pride in. Obviously I'm wearing my Olympic necklace because it just means so much for me. But what means the most to me is those little girls that are looking. I have a nonprofit, and building up the women that are underserved and those women that are not getting those exposures, like the powerhouses in the United States and the bigger countries that have that, is my biggest goal."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"All those Canadians and all those people that are not only Canadian but in West Africa in countries that are underserved and overlooked, you can make it. I promise you can because I was that kid, and I'm on the biggest stage now. I'm trying to pave a way for all those young women. So yeah, just keep going, because trust me, basketball is on the rise for women."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Oh, it's going to be all business, for sure. It's going to be a lot of trash talking. We are so competitive even in practice, so I can only imagine playing against them. But it's going to be such a surreal moment to be able to play against your teammates on the highest level because not a lot of people can say that."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,LAETICIA AMIHERE,"Defense is my passion. That's something that I prided myself on. I'm lengthy, I disrupt and I'm going to go after it. That's something that I can promise to Atlanta Whether it's a night that I get a couple minutes or a lot of minutes, I'm going to go out there and give it my all because it's something that I've always prided myself on is defense and trying to get possessions for my team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Eyes wide with surprise. Pulls phone out of pocket.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, he has done everything he needed to do. We appreciate all the work that he has put in. It's been a long, whatever, six, seven weeks of this. He is putting himself out there, available."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It's all hands on deck. We are going with our initial start, normal rotation, and we'll see how the game plays out. We have no idea how this game is going to play out, but it's great to have everybody available. Even Vic Oladipo is here with us. He is not going to play, but he is here just to pour everything into this team and this game tonight to make sure we get this thing back to Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know at this point. There's no guarantees about it. Obviously, these are unusual circumstances. I'm just going to read the game. He is going to be available. I'm not going to disrupt everything initially. It's not realistic for him to step into the role that he was doing before. But it sure is great just to have everybody here, all of those guys available, and having Vic now here. We just feel whole. We're focused on getting this game tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, our guys will be able to take that quality the rest of their careers that grit, the perseverance, the toughness, the ability to compete and put yourself out there for everybody to judge and to be able to handle different things, adversity, all that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'll speak for everybody in our locker room and the organization. You know, congratulations to the Denver Nuggets organization. They are a class act and they are one hell of a basketball team. One hell of a basketball team that we couldn't really find obviously enough solutions to be able to get us over the top."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I don't know, those last three or four minutes felt like a scene out of a movie. Two teams in the center of the ring throwing haymaker after haymaker, and it's not necessarily shot making. It's the efforts. Guys were staggering around because both teams were playing and competing so hard. That's what this league should be about."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"There's no regrets on our end. There's just sometimes where you get beat, you know, and Denver was the better basketball team in this series. That's about as hard -- I don't know how long it would take me to go through the autopsy of this Final game, but I would say that it will probably rank as our hardest, competitive, most active defensive game of the season, and it still fell short."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"And probably our second-highest rated game would have been Game 4, and we fell short by double-digits. That gives you a good indication of how good this Denver Nuggets team was in this series but also throughout the course of the season and all of the playoffs. They were the superior team in every series. They deserve this championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we would have liked to be able to climb the mountaintop and be able to get that final win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But I think this is a team that a lot of people can relate to. If you ever felt that you were dismissed or felt that you were made to feel less than. We had a lot of people in our locker room that probably have had that, and there's probably a lot of people out there, you know, that have felt that at some time or another."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But also the way this team handled setbacks and adversity, you know, to develop a collective grit and perseverance. I mentioned this before that hopefully these are lessons that will transcend this beautiful game that hopefully these are lessons that we can pass along to our children that even though it is sport, that you can learn lessons of life from this game that you can persevere that you can handle what people may view as mini-failures along the way and become stronger from it and to be able to overcome things and find beautiful things on the other side of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Now, obviously, we didn't get the final win, but sometimes that's true in sport and also in life that you don't always get what you want. But there's no regret from our side. Everybody, staff, player alike in the locker room put themselves out there and put themselves into the team, whatever was best for the team. And the tough pill to swallow is it just wasn't good enough. We ran up against a team that was just better than us in this series."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"You have to tip your hat to them. I said it, but they are one hell of a basketball team. They play the right way, they compete, they are well-coached and they have a strong culture. So for this season, they deserve this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"A little bit of that. Sometimes it's just not your time. You know, some of the message that I gave the team is an intimate message just for the group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But what I can tell you, we're all hard-wired to compete for the ultimate prize. But you also want to develop lifelong memories and a brotherhood and a bond that you'll be able to carry on from years from now that we've been able to go through something that's memorable."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I told each one of the guys, I love them. I love this team, and I'm just super grateful that we are able to go through all of the experiences, even the tough times during the year, to be able to have a season like this. This is one for the journal books, right. I don't know about all the guys journalling, but this is certainly one that I'll journal and remember this team forever."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Years from now, I'll bump into some of these guys and we'll have this bond, even though we didn't get that final prize."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,It's just a really tough call and I'll probably have to wrestle with that all summer. I've never been in an experience like this. I just know that the way this game was played is totally different than -- you can't even compare it. It's another sport in the regular season.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But first round, this is totally different, the way this game was played. Second round, totally different. Even the Conference Finals, the physicality and the way that they play, and I think they should have. This is what it should be about, is let the players decide."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"But that's the hardest-played, most physical competition you can have, and that would be a tough thing for a guy that's been out for two months that hasn't had any kind of ramp up. But that won't save me from thinking about that for the next few weeks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,ERIK SPOELSTRA,All right? Appreciate all of you sticking around and we'll see you down the road.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, my jumper was broke all series. I didn't play well offensively. To my capabilities."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,But they know what I'm capable of. They see me every day in practice. The confidence they were giving me every day was what good teammates do.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I just stayed with it. Even tonight, it wasn't my best shooting night, but I just kept playing hard. That's all you can control is your effort. I could have scored zero points. I don't care, we won a championship. Can't nobody tell me nothing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I don't really think you can put it into context. Nikola, he does so many things for our team. He's so good of a basketball player. I don't really think people understand how good of a basketball player he is."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But to do this where we're happy for him and we're happy for everybody on the team, but Nikola, he led us all Playoffs with his passing some games, scoring other games. This was a historic run. I don't know how you can say he's not the best big man ever really. He's one of the all-time best basketball players. I don't care what anyone says. I think he's one of the all-time best players to ever play this game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"To be on this team, he makes it easy for the rest of us. But we've got so many good players on this team, man, we're happy we got to do it with this group of guys because we don't know if we'll be together how much longer, but to do it with this group of guys, it feels amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, to me, that's not really that good of a game. I didn't think I played that good all series. I don't know what was going on with my shot. I really don't care. I'll fix it in the offseason."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, it was good to be able to get a couple shots to go this clincher. I'm not even supposed to be here, to be honest with you. After everything I've been through, I'm not really supposed to be a World Champion."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But to do it with this group of dudes after everything that -- I can't describe it. I look back on everything, how hard I worked, and it just feels surreal."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I'm glad Coach took me out and put him in. He got that put-back bucket and then two big free throws. That's what this team is about. We're really selfless. As long as we win the games, no one really cares. That stems from how we are as an organization, but also Nikola, our best player, how he is. He doesn't care if he scores, assists, rebounds as long as we win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, Bruce has been huge for us all Playoffs. We're excited for him because he's going to get paid. He's going to get paid. He was amazing for us all Playoffs, off the bench. We just kept telling him be aggressive, even though his first half didn't go amazing making shots-wise. He hit that big bucket down the stretch, made those two free throws. He was amazing for us all Playoffs. It wasn't just tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I mean, we made some adjustments, but that's a closeout game. I feel like that game was just intense and it was physical. People were missing shots. Like it wasn't a pretty basketball game. But that's what winning a championship is about. You've got to be able to win it in many different ways."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We didn't shoot the ball good all game. I didn't shoot the ball good. As a team we didn't shoot the ball good. But to win a championship that's what it takes. That's what's different about the Playoffs and the regular season. Forget about the stats, forget about the shooting percentage. It's just about winning."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I forget. I think he was just trying to tell us what he saw in the game. But Joker, he gets animated sometimes. For the most part he's very calm, cool and collected, but if he sees something he knows will work, he's going to make sure all of us on the floor hear what he's saying and follow through with that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Like I said in the interview a couple days ago, his IQ is off the charts. So if he sees something, he's going to let us know that's what we need to do, so I think that's probably what it was."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was really hard to put into words. Still is. Yeah, I couldn't even hold it in. I don't know. I couldn't really hold it in. It was just a surreal moment. Everything was hitting. Everything was hitting at once, from the journey, to the celebration with the guys, to enjoying the moment, to looking back on the rehab, to looking back at myself as a kid, as the other viewer, looking from the crowd in or from the camera lens in, and now looking back at them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"It was a lot. I couldn't hold it in. It was just something I've been working for my whole life. I think Mike said it, Porter. Every real hooper wants to be on this stage and play in the game and be in this moment. To see it full circle, going from my rehab, not being able to walk, go up the stairs, not just for a month or two. It was for a long time. A lot of different things going through my head. A lot of tears. A lot of blood, sweat and tears, and real ones."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Like I said, just to see it full circle and have total belief in myself, have the team have total belief in me, people back home have total belief in me, that's all I could ever ask for, and just to see it like this is amazing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"No, I really didn't try to think about it. I just wanted to stay focused. I think that's why I missed so many shots early. There was just so much adrenaline. You want to end it on your home court with all the fans there, your family there. You want to end it on the home court so bad. I just felt my shot."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,I was overshooting so much that it was short. Every shot was short. Forget -- whatever. That's just a me problem.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"But like I said, that adrenaline kicks in, and you want to do something so bad. That's why I was ready to go at halftime, calm down and reset myself and do whatever the team needs me to do to get the win. What was the question? All right, next question."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,Shoutout to Kyle.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Oh, man, you could hear it in the crowd, just the excitement. We have the best home court for a reason. I just felt like all season long, even the past couple seasons we were hurt. They were just there for us. When we didn't have the energy, they brought us energy. They gave me energy. They gave me energy to come out and do an arrow or make a couple shots or show a little bit more emotion than normal. They would really help me going. That's why everybody loves to play at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I can't shout out these fans enough. I'm so happy for the city of Denver, Kroenkes. We really, really earned this one."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,It's surreal to see it through. It's tough to answer these questions right now.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I knew I was going to suck for the first few games. I had to live with that. I knew I wasn't going to put up 40, 50 points in the first few games. I always say, if you go back to the first game in Utah, I picked up the ball in the paint like five times. I could count. I was so lost. I had never felt being that lost on the court before. I just didn't want to go in the paint or jump or land or feel contact. Just how far I've come from that moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I still have different moments where I'm tentative, best word for me to put it, to do certain actions, rebounding among everybody or -- but I've just gotten so much better at that and just putting that behind, not just me, Mike too. I think -- shout-out to Mike. He's gone through so many different injuries and to see him constantly locked in, be a team player, grow his game in different aspects, have an all-around game even if he's not shooting well. It's just really great to see the growth of this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, that first game in Utah, I was -- I don't want to say scared because I wasn't. I was confident but I was so tentative in everything I was doing, and just to see from that game to this game to the Finals game where I've come, it's just -- I'm just happy for myself."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I seen a picture of Jok and Embiid running for MVP, and Jok keeps running. I think that just speaks so much to what his mindset is. I got mad at him today in the game because he kept passing the ball. I hit him in the pocket, he has a floater and he'd pass it. Out of bound, turnover. I'm like, bro, just shoot it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"But that's just part of him. That's just his game. That's what makes us so good is, even if he's open and guys are late, you still have to guard him and guard everybody else. We're just an all-around team. You've got to guard every single person on the court, whether they can shoot or not, finish or not. Everybody is a threat. We play so unselfish giving each other spacing, giving each other different looks, knowing that the ball has energy and it will find you when the time is right."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I keep bringing up Mike, I thought he was amazing today. I didn't shoot well early, Jok didn't score early, a couple calls didn't go our way, and Mike, we just told him, this is your night. No matter what happens, this is your night. We tried to make an effort to get him going, and he took advantage of it. He kept us in the game for a minute, or whatever. He was just aggressive all night, and that just speaks to our team, wanting to see each other succeed."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Aaron Gordon, guarding the best player every night. Knowing he wants to shoot some step-back threes here and there. No, get your ass in the dunker, dunk the ball, and play defense. We're going to win a championship. And he's just so unselfish, he's just -- everybody played a pivotal part."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Jok is the Finals MVP and rightfully so and deserving, and he makes everybody connect and everybody want to win being so unselfish, and I thought down the line everybody was so unselfish for us to get this done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, I think for the biggest thing for us, I came off the bench backing up Gary Harris. I just think he had continual trust in my game and what I'm trying to do out there. When I'm bringing the energy, making shots or not, he trusts me to make the right play out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I got on him sometime during the season like hey, we're not your little kids anymore. We're grown men, and if we make a mistake just come talk to us. Just come talk to us. When we weren't that good, he had to have that kind of authority and defensive mindset and just get on us and pull it out of us. Now it's like we know what we need to do to win. We know what to expect from each other, and we can get on each other to push each other to be better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just thought he's -- not just this year, but each year that we've been together, he's just grown in how to handle us. I think that's so important, the way you handle people in the locker room on and off the court, and he's done an amazing job of just keeping us positive, coming to timeouts, keeping us positive, moving on to the next play when we make a mistake. Shout-out to Ryan Saunders, shout-out to DA, David Adelman."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"He's the worst coach ever. No one should take him. Laughter. He's horrible. He's disrespectful. He sucks. Yeah, so he's not going anywhere."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, the best word for me to say is unselfish and having trust in each other. The biggest thing is when we give each other space to work, we allow the defense to make mistakes or our reads to happen. AG just staying patient, knowing that he's going to benefit when the action is done. Mike staying patient, knowing that when Jok rolls, they have to tag and he is one of the best corner wing shooters in the league. He's going to benefit. If they double me, I don't need to force it. I just hit Jok in the pocket and let the play happen."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"KCP playing defense, knowing we are going to give him a touch here and there and find him in transition. CB doing everything he needs to do to stay on the court. Jeff just being a vet, honestly. DJ knowing he's not going to get in the game too much, but talking to me not just on the court but off the court, keeping me locked in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,I guess just down the line everybody had a role to play in our success. I'm just so happy for our guys. We really did this s--- together.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I have to say that I had my doubts, as well. It's just natural. Somebody asked me about butterflies. That's what makes you alive. That's what makes you care. When you doubt yourself, that's what makes you try to find a way to turn it around. In whatever sport, in whatever injury, in whatever career you're in, when you go through adversity, it's how you envision and visualize yourself at the end of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"Zach LaVine was a big help. We talked throughout the rehab and we were still rehabbing at the time. So I'm asking, are you still doing this, are you still doing this, what should I feel, what should I expect. Gallo, Oladipo, Klay, all those guys have shown that you can do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"I just wanted to be another guy to be an inspiration for those little kids that even at those young ages have gone through some adversity, knowing that when you put your mind to it, that will take care of itself. It's just the mindset you have to have. I've been such a big mindset guy growing up. It's just crazy to see it through, off ACL. This is fresh. This is a year out of playing, not having a summer to really work on my game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JAMAL MURRAY,"There's more to come from me. I know if I can do this fresh off an ACL, still having sore days and everything like that, we can do this again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, we're going to find out. It's easy to talk about, but it will be evident early in the game to see if we are playing with that desperation and that urgency that we need to if we are going to close it out tonight here at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But our guys have shown just great focus and discipline throughout the entirety of these playoffs. I think it's 19 playoff games we've played, and from the lead-in week to the first round against Minnesota and throughout, and today, in our shootaround, our guys have been really locked in, focused, and I think they all fully understand what we have and the opportunity that we have in front of us."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's not going to be easy, you know, as I told our team, right when we beat the Lakers. This is going to be the hardest thing that we have ever done. KCP is the only guy in that room that's won a championship, and tonight is going to be another example of us trying to achieve something that none of us have achieved, and I think all the guys are excited for the opportunity."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, that's probably a question best served for Stan Kroenke and Josh Kroenke. I am the beneficiary of that patience, and I'm very, very thankful for that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I'm not really sure where it's from. They own so many different sports teams around the world, but I think it's just in their nature, to be honest. I have gotten a chance to know Stan, know Josh. They are very calm, cool, collected. They don't react. And I'm really thankful for that, and I think our players are, too, because we wouldn't be in this moment if that had not been the course that they chose."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"To be honest, doesn't change anything. If they throw him out there, they throw him out there. But our approach is the same, our game plan is the same, and our energy, discipline and communication have to be the same."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I feel really fortunate that my father was a CYO coach, a high school coach, a college coach and a pro coach, and seeing him on a day-to-day basis. And then being around coaches like Pete Gillen, who I worked for in college Greg Kampe at Oakland University, Bobby Gonzalez."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"And then Jeff Van Gundy brought me in the league. It wasn't a long time with Jeff, but I learned so much in that brief time with Coach Van Gundy. And then I worked with Mike Brown in Cleveland, and obviously I took a lot from Mike and Mike was so impactful to my career. I wouldn't be a head coach if it wasn't for Mike Brown and the opportunities that he gave me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I worked for Monty Williams, Mark Jackson. So I think when you are a young coach, you want to be everything, and as you get older and you mature, it kind of funnels down and funnels down and then you kind of create your obvious identity of what you want to be and what you believe in."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I've had the luxury of being around great coaches my whole life, and you couple that with just staying true to my own self, and then here you go."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,I haven't really seen or been able to mingle. I'm not a big mingler. I do my job I go home.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I know for me what is special is when we're on this journey, I am thankful for Doug Moe and the guys that -- players and coaches that were here in the past that have never gotten this far but I know are so proud of what we've achieved to this point."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So guys like Doug Moe, Dan Issel, Alex English, David Thompson, you can go on and on about naming all the guys that have worn this jersey or coached this team and done a hell of a job in doing so. But not much mingling to this point. We'll see what happens."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, I think for me, you always have to challenge yourself to look in the mirror and get better, and that's something I think myself and the coaching staff throughout eight years have done every season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Whenever that previous season is over, we take some time away, and then we get back together in the summer and we take a really honest, in-depth look and figure out, what are our weaknesses, what are our blind spots, how do we improve."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,It's hypothetical to tell all your players to come back better players but you not being willing to come back as a better coach.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I remember a few years ago sitting down with Wes Unseld Jr. and looking a lot at our defense and coming to the realization that we had to simplify things. I think if you simplify things and just are aggressive, the players can go out and do that. You want them going out there and playing and being active instead of thinking."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So I think definitely, we continue to, even after this run, whenever it ends, we'll find a way to look at ourselves and try to be even better next season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I slept like a baby. I got up every two hours and cried, you know what I mean. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's funny, I go back to Game 1 in this series and my daughter said to me, my youngest daughter said, ""Are you nervous?"""
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I was like, really, at that point, I was not nervous. I was excited about the opportunity. I think the reason that myself, our coaches, our players, are not nervous is because we worked so hard to get here, and we are prepared."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think that's the most important thing. Our guys are locked in, and we know tonight is going to be a hell of a challenge. We know it's going to be an amazing atmosphere in front of the best fans in the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But all you can do is the work, and then you've got to trust that process to carry it through, and we have great players that I feel really confident are willing and able to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Pat Riley said something many years ago. I used to have it up on my board when I was a head coach in Sacramento, and it talked about the evolution in this game and how you go from a nobody to an upstart, and you go from an upstart to a winner and a winner to a contender and a contender to a champion, and the last step is after a champion is to be a dynasty."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"So we're not satisfied. We accomplished something this franchise has never done before, but we have a lot of young talented players in that locker room, and I think we just showed through 16 playoff wins what we're capable of on the biggest stage in the world."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"The best part about it is the people I just did that with. I love those guys. I love my coaches. Stan and Josh Kroenke are incredible owners. Their support, their continued belief. Calvin Booth, first year as a GM."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"And I just have to say on a personal note a huge thank you to my mother and father. I just spoke to them, let them know how much they're a part of this. Their love and support all along has meant the world to me. My beautiful wife Jocelyn, two daughters Caitlin and Bridget. I'm a really blessed person and I'm really enjoying this moment so don't screw it up by asking a stupid question. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, to your point, the first question, foul trouble, Aaron, Nikola, Jeff, I thought DeAndre played a few minutes but he went out there and did his job. So you couple the foul trouble with, we couldn't make a free throw or a three-point shot and we're down seven at halftime. That was my message at the break, was that we haven't played well, we've had foul trouble, we can't make a shot, and we're only down by seven points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Well, it's a maturation, a continued maturation. We all know that Michael didn't shoot the ball as well as we know he can. That's going to happen at times. This is a great experience for him because I think he realized, as I continue to tell our team, there are no specialists allowed on this squad. If your jump shot is not falling, do something else to help teammates. Not yourself, help your teammates -- defending, rebounding, hustling, whatever it may be."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think it's really important, let's not judge Michael Porter just on his shooting in the Finals. Look at his performance in the Western Conference Finals against Phoenix, against Minnesota and more importantly throughout the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Michael is only going to get better, and to have he and Jamal back healthy, this is what I really envisioned a few years ago when we got Aaron Gordon."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I was just joking with Josh, as the champagne is being sprayed all over the place. I said, Josh, I'm a rookie at this. I really don't know what I'm doing but you're used to this. You've won Stanley Cups, Super Bowls."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"But our ownership group has been phenomenal throughout this entire process. Eight years is a long time, and very thankful, as I've said many times, in allowing this to get to this point and win a championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,Stan and Josh are great owners. They allow us to do our job. I'm just thankful that we were able to add to that.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I've never felt any pressure. There was never any pressure. It was just -- I know they love all their teams, but I will tell you this Stan Kroenke grew up a basketball fan. He loves his Rams, he loves every other team he has, but he's a basketball fan. He grew up a basketball fan. Josh played Division I basketball. I think this one is really special for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I have to really make sure I shout out our fans. That atmosphere tonight was incredible. I remember year one eight years ago, and how far we've come and what we've built and the fans are a huge part of that. What really touched me was somebody showed me the video of Game 4 when we were in Miami and to see 18,000, 19,000 people in this building going crazy, they're a part of this. Our fans are a part of this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Huge shout out to Nuggets nation for showing up, representing, and a lot of love for them."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It's been amazing, because you can look at it one of two ways. You can look at it from the basketball perspective, two MVPs, Finals MVP, world championship and everything he's done on the court, and then more important for me you can look at off the court, the relationship, the love that I have for Nikola, his mother and father back in Sombor, Serbia, his brothers Nemanja and Strahinja, his wife Natalija and their daughter Ognjena. They're a wonderful family I've gotten very close to. And I've said this many times before, but Nikola even tonight, he's kind of acting like this was just another game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"He's never changed with all the success, and he never will. It's just not in his nature."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I love Nikola. Eight years, love Jamal, seven years. Been through a lot. Just for all of us to stay the course, to challenge ourselves, to all get better collectively, individually. Yeah, it's great to be a part of such a historically great player who's an even better person, and I mean that sincerely. This is not coach-talk. Nikola is just a great, great man."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"It hasn't hit me, and I don't think it's going to hit me tonight because I'm going to drink too much. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"These moments are surreal. I got in the league 22, 23 years ago, and I dreamed of becoming a head coach. Not knowing if I'd ever be given that opportunity. It doesn't come easy, and my father was a head coach once, and he's the best coach I know."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"To get to this point, to win a championship is just, as you reflect upon all the people who helped you get here. My high school coach Bobby Farrell at Seton Hall Prep, my prep school Tom Blackburn who passed away last year, the coaches I worked for in college, Pete Gillen, everybody like Greg Kampe, that gave me an opportunity to grow and improve to get to this."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"This is like a many, many years-long process, and you don't do it by yourself, and from my family, from my wife, from my daughters, from my mother and father, from my three sisters and two brothers and everybody else along the way, I want to say thank you for believing in me and supporting me and just giving me that unconditional love all the time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, it's just a stick-to-itiveness, staying with it, not feeling sorry for yourself. It's one of my favorite moments D.H. Lawrence ""Self-pity."" I hate people that feel sorry for themselves and Michael didn't. I'm not making shots, so what? What else can I do to help this team win a championship. That play where he went between the legs and finished was an amazing play, and that three that he hit you could feel the whole arena, like wow, there is not a lid on the rim. We can actually make shots tonight."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think it's important for everybody to understand that Michael is a young player. He missed his rookie season. He played nine games last year. I did my radio show a week ago and one of the hosts said, A lot of people in Denver are wondering if you're going to make a change to your starting lineup. After a win, mind you. I said, no, of course not. Michael Porter is our starting small forward, and he's a big part of our future."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"I know next time he's on this stage, he's only going to be better off for going through this experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"First and foremost, congratulations to the Denver Nuggets. Great franchise. Great team. They deserved it, and they beat us fair and square."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we go, and it's a special bond with this group. We were led by one of the best basketball players on this earth, and he instilled confidence in us. It's kind of one of those things where we don't know how we are going to feel and what we are going to think right this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"But you know, we'll look back at some point and say, hey, it was a great year, great run. But right now, just can't even think about that right this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"Probably how grateful I am to be able to compete with these guys. You never know what the team is going to look like next year, the year after that. I'm just grateful. I learned so much. They taught me so much. I wish I could have got it done for these guys because they definitely deserve it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,But the one thing I'm going to take from it is how grateful I am to be able to compete with them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's been great. I've had some helluva teammates come through and compete with me and give us the opportunity to win a championship, which I still believe, with everything in me, that we will do as a team here, as an organization, as a city in Miami."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"The four years have been great. It's always great to be wanted and loved and appreciated. I don't think that's going to change. But for the time being, like I just said to Nick, I'm grateful, man, that we made it here. Came up short, but I'm blessed. I'm fortunate."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,That I turned the ball over. That's what stood out.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,Zero. My ankle is fine. We just didn't win. There's no excuse. They beat us. That's all I got.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,Take it away.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,"I think we still got good looks. I think our pace was great. I think they made shots, and we didn't get out in transition as much as we wanted to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KYLE LOWRY,We shot 34 percent or something like that. We got some good looks and just missed them.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"No. We just missed shots. That's what this league is about. We make two or three more shots, that's what it's been for us all year long."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"I think we did enough to win. You guard well. We're still in position to win. You don't have to score a hundred points to win a basketball game. I think we'll be okay. That's Coach Pat and Coach Spo's job to put together another team, which I'm confident that they will do, and we'll take it from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,JIMMY BUTLER,"It's the norm. He's been doing that the entire series, since he's been here and been my teammate. We follow his lead. We follow Bam's lead. We follow everybody. We play basketball our way. You attack. It looks good. But we've seen it time and time again. It doesn't motivate me any more or any less. I know he is a champion and he wants to win. Whatever he's out there doing, it's to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"All of them. I think it's all of them. I'm happy for DJ. I'm happy for Jeff. I'm happy for Ish. Literally for everybody. Mikey, he had three surgeries and still came here and helped us win a championship. Jamal, who had surgery and didn't play well at the beginning of the season, like I told you guys, but we all know what he's capable of."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"KCP, he brought us the championship, Bruce, Christian Braun. Literally every single player. Every player on this team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"It's good. It's good. We did a job. I think we played the best basketball I'm not going to say in the postseason, but I think we were there playing the best basketball. Today we didn't make shots, but still, we defend."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I think it's a great journey. Like you said, 41st pick, but that doesn't matter. When you're here, you're a player. They have a couple guys that weren't even drafted and they're still playing and contributing to them to win."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't know that. That's great. But to be honest, I don't think about the next year. I'm going to ask the coach to give me a couple weeks more off so I can be ready for the season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"That's supposed to be a joke, and you didn't laugh. Good job, guys."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, but we have -- it's not the starting unit. It's the whole team. Since day one in San Diego, it was something different about this team. I felt it. I felt some different energy and every day since then I had the same feeling. I'm not really optimistic guy, but that gave me hope that we can do something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, we have an impact on things, but of course Americans are the majority of the league, and they're supposed to be because they are -- USA won I don't know how many gold medals in a row and then Spain won it last year. But I think there are some European players and there will be some European players contributing to win and giving that edge to the good teams to win championship."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,No. I need to go home. Laughter.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I mean, we succeed in our jobs, and we won the whole thing. It's an amazing feeling. But like I said before, it's not everything in the world. I think. Okay, I won it. Okay, not I, we won it. But I think it's not the most important thing in the world still. There is a bunch of things that I like, that I like to do. Probably that's a normal thing. Nobody likes his job, or maybe they do. They're lying. Laughter."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"But it's a good feeling when you know that you did something that nobody believes, and it's just us, it's just the organization, Denver Nuggets believing in us, every player believing in each other, and I think that's the most important thing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, not just daughter, my wife who was with me since day one, even in Belgrade, my brother that I live with my brother. Actually, we all lived together in one moment, so it was a circus. But they are somebodies that are in my life. It means a lot, and without them I'm not going to be here 100 percent."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I didn't slam the chair, but I like how you make it bigger. Yes, I yell at them because we were just shooting threes, and I think it was like 4-on-3, we could just get an easy layup or score the ball. In that situation, it means a lot -- like to score a ball. Especially it's a low-scoring game, we didn't make shots, they didn't make shots. It was 90-something, 80-something game. I think easy points are something that kills it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"In that situation, emotions, yes, I yell at them, but I think they're used to it. Sometimes I yell at them, sometimes I cheer them but that's part of the family, part of the team."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I don't remember, but -- yes, I think Sparky got me. But it's a great emotions. Everything is in a good positive way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Got to be. Congratulations. I'm going to see if he texted me, no? I don't know. Oh, my phone."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,A lot. A lot. I'm not going to -- I'm going to turn off the phone.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's amazing. It's been so long for the Nuggets organization to be in this position, and we knew we wanted to just come out and be the first team to ever do it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,I'm excited to even just be a part of the history that we made tonight.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,What's next? Me and Bruce is going to shoot 100 jumpers in the summertime and we're going to play golf the whole summer. That's what's next for me and Bruce.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I mean, everybody wants to run it back after you win. But that's up to the organization is to bring back the players or whatever it is. But this team is special. I knew it from training camp, and just been telling them all the way through training camp and the whole season, we can do this. Just believe in ourselves, in each other."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"We feel amazing, obviously. Since day one in training camp in San Diego, we knew we could do this. We worked for this. Was it 17 of us, 15 of us? Worked extremely hard. Every practice, every game, we stayed locked in. We stayed together. So I'm just extremely happy for the group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"To always be ready. He's a guy that sees the floor no matter where he's at, so you can be open at any time. Just be ready to score and be ready to shoot at any time because he'll pass you the ball. Essentially, he's a point center, which is ridiculous. We haven't seen that before. We've seen a point power forward. Never seen a point center before. So he's the first."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"I'll take a little time off. I'm going to probably be with Doug, learn how to ride a horse, drink a lot of Jameson and Gingers, play a lot of golf and then be with my dog. Other than that, be with my boys back at home."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,He's going to get paid is what he's going to do. He's going to get paid to start playing. My man fitting to get a bag.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"I told myself if and when we win, I'm going to do exactly what we and I did to get to this point. I'm going to celebrate, but I'm going to continue to work smarter, harder and more efficient."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,That's a professional answer right there.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,That was tough with a lot of champagne.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"He's been amazing for me. Just confidence. As you've seen, we've got Nikola, Jamal, MPJ and Aaron on the floor, and last game he's putting the ball in my hands and letting me make a play. So that says a lot. He has the confidence in his players. If he needs to get on you, he'll get on you. But he means well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, he's just a competitor. He's so damn competitive. He wants it just as much as we want it, if not more. It doesn't matter if we're up 20 or down 20, he's on us. He just stays competitive, and you've got to respect that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"We saw it. We saw it. When I first got traded, we saw it. We felt like we had all the pieces in order, put together. Then, yeah, of course injuries. But then we got Brucey B and we got KCP, and with the addition of them, it was wraps."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,"No, it didn't sink in. I got the bucket because AG, he had two on him and they forgot about me. So kudos to AG. This is why me and KCP came here this offseason. This is what we wanted to do. This is what we envisioned. This is just a great ending."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Man, it's straight like joy, emotion, validation, just excitement. I heard Brucey B was talking earlier about how he was putting in -- he was waking up at like 600 a.m. or 400 a.m. and doing two-a-days and grinding. That's what we have on this team we have grinders."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Just for two-a-days, three-a-days, four-a-days, and for it to all pay off and all come down and be with the team and be with guys we love, it was emotional, honestly. It's crazy."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,For sure smiling.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"Well, we're going to enjoy tonight, of course. This is a night to be celebrated --"
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BRUCE BROWN,A few weeks. Not just tonight. We're going to enjoy this for a few weeks.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,AARON GORDON,"A few weeks to be celebrated. But I believe that it can be replicated. The guys on this team are very humble. The humility is there, the IQ is there and these guys are workers. Championship or not, we don't let it change our character."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"Man, it was a whirlwind because going into this season, we expected -- obviously we didn't get off to a great start in the beginning of the season, and then go through adversity, guys being out, playing with eight guys, still trying to find a way, missing shots, everybody counting us out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"You lose the first Play-In game, then win the second one and you go on an unbelievable run to the Finals."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"The only thing I can say is, man, they need to put more respect on undrafted players. They are still basketball players at the end of the day, and obviously you've seen, they can take you there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So for me, it was a joy to get this far and have these type of guys, undrafted, fighting to make a name for themselves. And they fought to the Finals. Came up short, but I don't care what anybody says. You can never count these guys out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"No, he just makes the right play every possession. I feel like that's the biggest thing about the player that he is. He's going to try to make the right play every possession, no matter if he's scoring the ball or passing it, getting a high-key assist. It doesn't matter. I feel like that's what makes him dynamic."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"It definitely wasn't the last two minutes. That's what everybody usually tries to take away from the game, the last two minutes, what we did wrong or what happened. I think through the duration of the game, they got a lot of relief points, offensive rebounds, run-outs in transition. You know, us on missed communications and so forth. So I wouldn't say it was just the last two minutes."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MAX STRUS,"Hard to put into words right now. Still trying to get over this. We didn't want to be done. I think the biggest part about that was the fun we had together, this group, after we picked up Kevin Love and Cody Zeller. It was just unique how we all came together and enjoyed this run together and just had fun."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MAX STRUS,"I didn't want it to end tonight. Wanted to keep going. Through all the adversity we had all season, it's hard to put into words how grateful we are for the year and grateful to be in the position we had."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MAX STRUS,"But we came up short. It's going to be a lesson that we've all learned, and we'll be better for our careers going forward."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"You take the experience of this season and if you can just bottle that up, and everybody just have their own portion or rewritten story of it. The No. 1 thing I think would be will."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So looking forward, I think this is one of my favorite teams I've ever been a part of because we willed our way through ups and downs. We willed our way through the things that people said we couldn't do."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So for me, the future, I just take these lessons and I apply them to the next season. Whenever we go through adversity, I'm always going to look back and be like, we've been through adversity before. You know, having the 8 seed in the Finals isn't normal. It isn't easy. People think it depends on what seeding you are is how good you're going to be. To me, that's bull----, and obviously this season showed different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,BAM ADEBAYO,"So just looking forward, I'm always going to believe that we've got a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"The mood has been the same. We know what we're capable of. We're optimistic, and we're looking forward to Game 5."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, just about at this point we've almost seen everything under the sun. We're just looking forward to it. We've been keeping things pretty in house, and we're a pretty confident group."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"I think they play a different brand of basketball than most of the league. I think the way they cut, the way Joker is able to facilitate and still be aggressive to score, and obviously the challenge of Jamal Murray."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"They have a lot of different weapons. They play a little different style, and it's been effective for them throughout."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,Just continue to believe in what we are capable of and what we've been doing all year. Come into Game 5 with the right mentality and sense of urgency.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"One play at a time. That's how. That's high praise from a legendary coach, so I'm grateful to hear that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"It's just one game. Whether it's a good game or a career high or career low, it's still just one game, and everything resets when that final buzzer rings."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,I'm sure. I'm sure that's a weight off his shoulders to have a healthy baby born and to have a healthy mom there taking care of the baby.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,We're happy for him and we're happy to welcome a new member to his family.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,GABE VINCENT,"I think every team we've played this playoff run we've been called undersized, so I don't think we're going to use that as an excuse now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Omer is the man. Unfortunately he was hurt all year, which was unfortunate for him and for us. He could have helped all year. Just a big man, big presence, super skilled. We would have loved to have him. Just unfortunate timing for him this season."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Same as every game. Try to maintain the same process of getting ready, figure out adjustments, figure out ways we can be better and just get ready for the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Just play good defense. It is what it is at this point. We've got another elimination game, which we're used to by this point, and we're looking forward to it. Looking forward to getting started tomorrow night, and can't wait."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"No, we're the same. We've still got a chance to play. There's 28 teams that are sitting on their couch watching us. We're all competitors. We want to be here. We want to play. We want to be here and compete in these moments and compete at the highest level."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Sure. There's a lot of things that we could do better, multiple things offensively and defensively that we need to do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"Kevin's voice is always heard in our locker room, a champion, vet. He's been through it. Kyle has been in the 3-1 game, too. They've both had stories that they've shared with us and ways to motivate and help us and understand the situation. We're always listening to guys like that. He's huge for our locker room."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MAX STRUS,"For sure. For sure. This whole season has been dedicated to him. To get here for the Finals and to try to win a championship for him is always on our minds. We still have that opportunity, and we're going to try to take advantage of it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I'm not that irascible, am I? Laughter. Ramona and I are in a great place. I was not talking about Ramona. Sometimes people read me wrong."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"So we're talking about Herro. No new update. He's doing another contact workout today. I probably won't have anything for you tomorrow morning -- oh, we don't have a shootaround."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, somebody else draw that next straw."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we were actually just reading that. He was talking about the Mamba Mentality. What a spectacular win and career. He's talked about that mental side of the game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have a very mentally tough team. We do believe in that. We have a big goal and, from our standpoint, nothing has changed. It is extremely challenging to accomplish that ultimate title. We have a very stubborn and defiant group, and I think it's good to have a little bit of defiance from time to time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we need to do a better job, just overall, with our offense, some of the details and how we can shift their defense. They definitely made an adjustment to try to stay at home on three-point shooters. It's not the first time we have faced that. I think that's a great compliment to them and how important they are to our offense."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We just have to do it better. There's certain things that I thought we did great in Game 3, and then there's different things we did great in Game 4. We just need to put it all together. It might not be perfect, but put more things together that are in our strength zones, even against what they are trying to get accomplished."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,That's what the deal is. They are trying to take away certain things. We are trying to get to certain things. How can you get to it and how can you get it on your terms.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,Look at me. I look ridiculous. I'm not out there playing. He's not playing against me laughter. That's absurd. No.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"That's the Miami Heat toughness that we're talking about laughter. He should have been allowed to take the first swing. Yeah. We won't reveal who that is, but yeah, he can take a punch and get back up. He's not going to miss any time."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"We have just -- I've used this term before, savage competitors. They love the ultimate challenges and the ultimate competition. Some of the fiercest battles were back in training camp when we were competing and splitting up teams. We could barely get through those full-contract practices without everybody screaming at each other, yelling at the coaches that are officiating, arguing about the scores. It's that level of intensity when they are playing and competing for a score."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Love playing in these kind of environments where the crowd is going to be great tomorrow. Everybody is counting us out. We're used to that. But ultimately it has to be decided between those four lines. The crowd is not going to decide it. The narratives are not going to decide it. Whatever the analytics are about 3-1, that ain't going to decide it. It's going to be decided between those four lines, whose game can get to whose game and ultimately win at the end. That's what our guys love."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,So we're looking forward to it.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"By the time we got on the flight, everybody was great. We get to compete in this kind of game tomorrow night. Everybody is looking forward to that. If you're a real competitor, you want this. You want the feeling that you have today, tomorrow, leading up to the game, how you feel in your heart and your stomach when that ball gets tipped up."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"Yeah, we've had setbacks. That's part of the playoffs. Tough losses. Our group has shown a resilience to bounce back and show that defiance time and time again."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Definitely give them some credit in terms of just staying home just a little bit more. But like I said, we feel like we can still generate good looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I mean, it wasn't cool that he was killing us and we were losing. That wasn't cool. But I have a lot of respect for Bruce and his journey and the path that he's taken."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Like he probably mentioned, we go back, same area, playing with, against each other, high school, and then just following his career all the way through."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"It's been really cool to see him really kind of reinvent himself and constantly find ways. He's just a good basketball player. He can do it in different ways. Comes in as a point guard and is a really good point guard for Detroit and then finds a new role in Brooklyn and bounces around, and now he's obviously a big part of the Western Conference champions."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think we have really solid leadership in place, whether it be coaching staff, whether it be guys that are battle tested in that sense. I think we have a collective trust and belief in each other that regardless of the circumstances, we have enough to get it done."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"I think we also just don't get too far ahead of ourselves. We take it step by step. Like today, it's just all about maximizing this prep and this practice. Tomorrow in the morning, it'll be the same. Then when the ball gets rolled out tomorrow night, it's just about finding a way to get one game, and we'll go from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,Just kind of having that resolve and experience I think makes a big difference.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I think this team is different than the other teams we've faced. They're relentless. They're going to come in full force. We ended up actually blowing Phoenix out in Phoenix, but we know tomorrow is not going to be like that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But one thing about this team is we just have a game-by-game mentality, so we're viewing it as we're down 3-1, we're not up 3-1 right now. We've got to win tomorrow. That's our mindset, and that's pretty much how we've done all Playoffs and these elimination games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Well, we rely on our team. We rely on our brothers. We understand what the task is at hand and what we're trying to accomplish and the opportunity that we have in front of us, and to accomplish that you need a level of focus."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"While the rest of the city is frenetic and ecstatic and buzzing, we've got to stay calm and we've got to stay level headed and focused to achieve what we've set out to achieve since training camp."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I mean, this is an amazing experience, an amazing opportunity for P-Wat. Would he like to be playing? I'm sure he would. But he's behind some really, really, really great players, and he's getting to observe and getting to study and all the energy that he's not using on the court he gets to store up and use it for when he does get on the court."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"That's a Point God right there, 12 assists, no turnovers, not forcing, hitting big shots, timely shots, and really just being a floor general out there, being steady, rock solid, even when they're trapping, giving him different looks."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"He's making the right play, and that's what we need from him night in and night out."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We've only got hopefully one game left, so hopefully I can catch a rhythm this game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"But I did what I could last game. I think I played with good effort. I think I tried to get downhill, get to the rim, be active cutting. My teammates found me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Getting to the line is big for me, so when my shot is not falling, even though that's my bread and butter, is my jumper, but there's other ways impact the game. So, I just got to keep looking to do that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"I'm going to let a few fly tomorrow. Hopefully they go in, but if not, I'm going to stay active defensively, on the boards, cutting to the rim, all those things."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I mean, we've been doing a good job on the glass. I think defensively it helps, as well. Then we're able to post on the block, just using our size and using our advantages physically."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"But yeah, we've got to go through Joker, continue to go through Joker, give him the spacing that he needs, and then eat off him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I mean, it's quarter by quarter for sure. I think there's a sweet spot in the emotion because we know we're coming into tomorrow excited, we want to win in front of our home crowd, finish it here, but we can't come in too high because we know they're coming in desperate."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"We've just got to stay even keel, which I think our team does a good job of doing. Even if the first few minutes don't go our way, we tend to steady out over the course of a game and find our groove."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"It's going to be ups and downs tomorrow. We know it's going to be a crazy game. They're going to come out firing on all cylinders, but if we just stay together and keep our head down, there's going to be stretches during the game where we're just flowing."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"That's how it's been all series. We go on big runs, we have been up big, even the game we lost. They didn't all start good. We just got to stay steady out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I mean, it's really important. We need to play a sound, solid defensive game tomorrow to come out of here with a win. It needs to be disciplined, not break down, and not let some of the other guys get going. It's important. It's crucial."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Yeah, I think one thing that I really respect about Coach Malone is just that he's consistent in how he is. Like he hasn't coached us any different, tried to motivate us any different than he has all season. Coach Malone is very competitive."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"Even game 82, I think we played against Utah, I'm pretty sure, but he was just as -- I think we lost that game. He was just as upset about losing that game as he would a game right now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,MICHAEL PORTER JR,"So he's very consistent in his approach and the way he coaches us individually and as a team. Like I can respect that, and I think that's one thing that I see from him."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, I think Mike said it best. He's competitive. He's a straight competitor. It doesn't matter if we're up 20 or down 20. He's going to be on us either way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,"I know they want it bad, but we want it bad, too. I don't think anybody wants it badder than we want it."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,AARON GORDON,"Yeah, they complement each other very well. They are both three-level scorers. They can both use the pick-and-roll. One setting it, one coming off of it, vice versa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JAYSON TATUM,"It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,NIKOLA JOKIC,"I cannot tell you that, my friend, because I think they are looking at this, too. They're a really intelligent team. They have really smart players, Jimmy, Bam, Kyle, who can read the moment and read the game. They can just kind of morph in some different zones, if that makes any sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"Oh, okay. I mean, that's what -- that's what Spo wants us to do. He wants us to be aggressive. He wants us to be assertive. He wants us to make things happen. He wants us to create. And you know with that responsibility, we have to be smart with it. And I feel like all the shots that me and Jimmy took were good shots. We missed a couple. I feel like my teammates missed a couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,JALEN HOOD-SCHIFINO,"Yeah, for one, thank you to the Lakers' organization for obviously selecting me. But to my teammates and the fans there, they're getting a big-time player and even better person. Just somebody who is going to bring it every day, push the people around me. Just someone that is going to work hard."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Guys made plays for them, they got stops. I thought we did a good job against their zone early in the game. I thought in that fourth quarter we got very stagnant against that zone and it kind of bothered us a little bit. So we've got to be better there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,DANTE EXUM,"I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Really proud of what our owners -- this is something, the owners actually appoint and pay the coaches, that our owners have stepped up to do. I think it's something we have our eye on, we had our eye on as soon as I came into the league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Sport is something that always in Serbia was something that put in front of us everybody, even like 10, 20 years ago, whatever, but now when we have Djokovic who won, probably the best ever. For us he's the best ever of course, and now we have our NBA championship, and I think it's a really good moment to be a Serbian."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,It's like four or five.
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,ISMAEL KAMAGATE,"More exciting, more motivation to be better day after day. Yeah, you get many players who get drafted late and make a good career. I'm not worried about this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KYLE LOWRY,"I think as a group, I think we've found ways that we've gotten great looks. I think we've found a little bit of a rhythm offensively. We haven't made all the shots."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,Also just taking our time and trying to get this win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"In the moment, it's us, our coaching staff, our players. But this was for all Nuggets. That was what was really cool about it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"I wouldn't say that it was a lineup change. I get what you're saying. We just went back to our original lineup. We went with this lineup for 14 games. I didn't have the foresight, I didn't. That's on me."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I've heard that. Yeah, I don't know. Just my father's last name, as well. I don't know. I guess I've got like H's in my family or something."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"Just an amazing duo. They've been together for the longest, and just how comfortable they are with each other and how they know each other's tendencies and what works for them and us as a team. It was just truly amazing to watch."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"That's three 6'9"", 6'10"", 6'11"" guys who can dribble, pass and shoot, have high II think that's going to be a huge advantage for us and a struggle for other teams to game plan for."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,WALKER KESSLER,"Yeah, super, super looking forward to it. Super excited about, just playing in the league in general. Just super excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 30,AARON GORDON,"Well, we have player personnel sheets and booklets essentially that we can go through and study players' tendencies, what their strengths are, what they like to get to, how they're most effective. Then I just kind of go through that, treat it like a Bible for the next couple of days and just stick to the script."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,MARK WILLIAMS,"For sure. It's something I take pride in, the defensive end. Having that opportunity, having that role, is something I'm really looking forward to."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,AARON GORDON,"I think it's a standard that we hold ourselves to and that we have held ourselves to all year long. We've been building habits day in and day out. So, you get to a game like this, the biggest stage in basketball, you let your standard of play and you let your habits carry you."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I had a feeling from the information I was being told is that it was just kind of up in the air. Orlando wasn't really sure yet, and just to be ready for whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 13,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,"Obviously, hindsight is 2020, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Yes, to be honest, it's something that -- since year one, whoever was kind of speaking my language or I'm trying to kind of stay in touch or whatever, some guys maybe a little bit more, some guys a little bit less, but I'm trying to stay in touch with everybody."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,GRACE BERGER,"Yeah, I mean, I think I knew the Fever were interested, but you never know until draft night obviously happens. I wasn't getting my hopes up or anything like that. Was just keeping an open mind."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"We decided that given that investigation was ongoing and it remains ongoing, that it wouldn't be appropriate for him to work in these Finals. I don't know what the ultimate conclusion will be. We'll see where the facts take us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"But to your point, I think that's -- Nikola never tries to impose his will or force things that aren't there. He's going to read the game. He's going to make the right play. Most importantly he's going to make every one of his teammates better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,KYRIE IRVING,"A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JEFF GREEN,I think defensively he is definitely one of the best defenders out there. I credit that to his IQ but also his activeness with his hands.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, I think it's an opportunity to learn. You watch the film, go to school on it, try to take away some things that you did well, and then certainly learn from some things that you can do better."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, it seems like they've prioritized that, just maybe helping a little bit less on drives and staying home a little bit more. So it's an adjustment. It's something that we're used to and we feel like we can still generate good three-point looks. It's just going to be a matter of running good, crisp offense with pace, full court and half court, and then just playing to our strengths."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,BRUCE BROWN JR,I really haven't thought about free agency at all.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"Yeah, there's lots of moments, kind of when there's a pause in the action, I guess, if you will, to kind of step back and be appreciative of the journey. When you're in it throughout the day to day, you're just focused on what's next. Obviously your perspective shifts and changes as you advance in your career and you want more for yourself, because we're all competitive people."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"Sometimes a dream is deferred, and our dream was deferred for a few years, but we stuck with it, and we added the right pieces. Huge shoutout to Calvin Booth and the job he's done. This is just an unbelievable feeling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,JOE MAZZULLA,"And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,AARON GORDON,P-Wat has a great feel for the game and a chance to be a really great player for this team and to help this team along the way. I'm excited for P-Wat and the experience that he has gathered thus far.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 16,SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"Just enjoying and embracing this moment, I think that was the biggest lesson. I feel like I truly embraced it. I was very excited just to see my name pop up. It didn't matter if it was first round, second round. I'm just excited to be here. I know they're going to be always around me. I'm always going to be part of the Huskies family. I can always go talk to coaches, call them whenever, even the alums. It's just a big family. So it's nice to have them as my support group that I can always go to and ask questions about the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,JAMAL MURRAY,"Yeah, when you play a team numerous times in a row, you've got to know what's coming. They know what we're doing, we know what they're doing. We're going to keep adjusting, mixing things up, but everybody is -- he's locked in. KCP is -- it's a defensive game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability."
2023 - NBA DRAFT,June 22,GRADEY DICK,"Not too much. The main focus through this pre-draft process was everything on the court. That's what it's always going to be for me, just keeping the main thing the main thing. But obviously there's stuff to talk about off the court. So later on the road, obviously. But as of now, I'm excited to get out there tomorrow. I can't really put into words how I'm really feeling about it all."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, Tim Connelly hired me and brought me to the table here, and my countless conversations in my seven years with Tim, we would always talk about how we had the luxury of working for a group with Stan and Josh and the Kroenke family that is not going to be just a quick trigger. We have to make a move. We have to make a move. They were willing to take a step back and see this thing through."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,AL HORFORD,I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 4,DAVID FOGEL,"On behalf of Coaches Association President, Coach Rick Carlisle, and all of our head and assistant coaches, I'd like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, John Hareas, Mike Levine, Mark Broussard and so many people at the NBA, and for all the league support and assistance in providing this tremendous platform for our great coaches."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,KYRIE IRVING,"But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 14,JASON KIDD,"The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,ADAM SILVER,"One sad note I want to point out. With the exception of those COVID seasons, this will be the first season that Bill Russell won't be here to present his namesake trophy of the Finals MVP. Players honored him throughout this year with the No. 6 on their jerseys. That will be the same with the jerseys in the Finals, and of course his No. 6 remains on the arena floor."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JIMMY BUTLER,"I don't think I shot-faked a lot, though. I think I was just passing the ball to the open guy, which I will continue to do. Maybe I've got to get more layups, more dunks, more attempts at the rim to free our shooters a lot more often."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,BAM ADEBAYO,"But we're going to watch film tomorrow, get our minds wrapped around it, and I feel like we'll shoot more in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,OUSMANE DIENG,"Yeah, I worked out with them. That was a good place."
2022 - NBA DRAFT,June 23,TARI EASON,I just want to learn as much as I can personally and just grow as much as I can as a player.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,June 26,ROB DILLINGHAM,It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know that you're getting guys that have grown up in this business, grew up in a locker room, grew up with a ball in their hands. When I was a player, people would say, He's a coach's son, he's a heady player. That's not always the case. I've known some coaches' sons that weren't a heady player."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"I think our guys, if anything, over 15 playoff games now being 12-3, their confidence. I think the defense has been -- I know that was the biggest question mark probably for our team was well, can they defend well enough in the Playoffs, and I think we have."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ELIZABETH KITLEY,"I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 16,DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,KYRIE IRVING,"It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 13,JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I'm trying to think. Just guard your area, I guess. I was in the middle a lot, like I said. So I would just be guarding kind of the high post a little bit and just backing up and guarding the guys down low, and they told us a lot of times, box out in the zone because you don't have a man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYLEN BROWN,"But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I give our guys credit. They have been locked in. The energy has been very good. I think that we understand that while we don't know for sure who we're playing, we have an obligation to ourselves to make sure we're preparing and conditioning and doing everything with that pace and purpose that I mentioned."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,STEPHANIE SOARES,"Yeah, very competitive, team player, just love to be -- every part of the game, I love to be around my teammates. But yeah, just competitiveness, my length, so hopefully lots of blocks, lots of help on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,JOE MAZZULLA,So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,JAMAL MURRAY,"But some of the passes he makes and how quick he'll make them, I think that's what impresses me the most. There's no hesitation with that. Some guys don't hesitate with their jump shot. They go right into a shot no matter what. He does the same thing with his passing. It's hard to guard. Definitely with AG in the dunker spot, it's hard to guard him and have that guy step up and be in a tough spot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"They play the right way. That's something that you have to do, try to get them out of that rhythm. There's no easy way to do that. You just have to find a way."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 26,MICHAEL MALONE,"But I think Nikola, it's never about looking backward. It's always about looking forward and challenging himself to become the best player that he can be."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,October 18,KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 11,DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,MICHAEL MALONE,So there's so many areas we can clean up. I'm not worried about what they're going to do. I'm worried about the things that we have to do better to try to win Game 2.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,HAYWOOD HIGHSMITH,"I think it's a little bit of both. Definitely some things we can adjust on. It's also about a little bit more effort, just doing more. You always need more, always can do more. Like I said, this is a good team, so we just got to be well-prepared and ready for them. Yeah, we definitely have to make some adjustments on both ends of the court, but we'll figure it out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 11,DUNCAN ROBINSON,"He's a really good player, really good dude. It's always fun to go against people that you have a history with."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,MICHAEL MALONE,"You know, I think end of the day, you have to be true to yourself. Something I learned from my mother and father at an early age. So I've never tried to be someone I'm not. I'm not Gregg Popovich. I'm not Steve Kerr. I have to be me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,DORKA JUHASZ,"It's very special. They always supported me. I know they're very excited, as well, to see two more Huskies heading to the WNBA."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,CHRISTIAN BRAUN,I think they do a lot of really good adjustments throughout the game. That's what they're good at.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 9,BRUCE BROWN,"Really just be aggressive. We knew they were going to trap Jamal and try to get the ball out of his hands, so the other four players were going to have to make plays, and then luckily it was just my time in the fourth quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 12,KYRIE IRVING,"Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,UDONIS HASLEM,My body's been pretty solid. I've had a little bit of Achilles things I've worked through this year. But my body has been pretty solid.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"To your point, we've done a hell of a job all season long of protecting our home court. I don't think we've lost a game at home in the playoffs as of yet. We know Sunday night is going to be a hell of a challenge."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JEFF GREEN,"I mean, it's the Finals. The energy is always going to be electric. I think if anything it's more so just the personnel who was there. You had LeBron in Cleveland, you had KD, Golden State, Steph. It was just different personnel."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 12,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"It's different. I didn't have the crowd or my family in the bubble, so it was just my brothers on the team. But here it's different because got the crowd, I had my family in the stands, was able to get my kids on the court with me after we won. Just enjoying that experience with them, I'm happy."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,JORDAN HORSTON,"Yeah, okay, so I actually talked to Rae a couple weeks before. She was just asking me where my head was and just, you're going to be good. Just be you. Go in there. Work hard. Just the things that a good teammate would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 9,JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 29,KENTAVIOUS CALDWELL-POPE,"I'm surprised on our focus. Our focus is tremendous. Even though we've had this long period of time off, everybody still has the same mindset. It hasn't faded away. Everybody still has the same energy. They're just ready to play, feeling a little antsy, just ready to get out there."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,ERIK SPOELSTRA,"It is unique. I think that's what you expect at the final level, that there's not going to be absolutes. You have to read the defense, still try to get to our game. We have to be aggressive. Then we have to make the appropriate plays and reads possession by possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 6,ADAM SILVER,"But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 1,MICHAEL MALONE,"Yeah, one thing about Nikola is he takes great satisfaction in making plays for others. He really does. I think he takes more joy in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 5,KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,KEVIN LOVE,"Everything, man. We were there I think for five days. We saw Christ the Redeemer, we went to different beaches, different places to eat, as well as seeing all the basketball fans over there and how the game has grown."
2023 - WNBA DRAFT,April 10,ASHLEY JOENS,"So really excited to be drafted, excited to get to Dallas and get into training camp."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 8,JADEN HARDY,Probably Alex Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,KYLE LOWRY,"Everyone has their own minds, for sure. When you have one common goal, it's only about this championship, I think it's a little bit easier to get closer to the same page mentally than everyone else."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,NIKOLA JOKIC,"Las Vegas tell us that we were underdog before. That doesn't... It's not correct, I think."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 6,GABE VINCENT,The day I walked through the doors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,April 15,ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 3,JAMAL MURRAY,"Nah. I had one of my high school teammates who played for the Heat at the time, so I saw him a lot. But other than that, no."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,June 17,JAYSON TATUM,"There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,May 31,GABE VINCENT,"Yeah, it's awesome. There are athletes that came before me that I looked up to and I'm still close with. So I'm fortunate enough to be able to be the one right now that's in the limelight, to be able to represent our area the best I can, and I look forward to being able to represent Miami, as well, and trying to get this title."
2023 - NBA FINALS: HEAT VS. NUGGETS,June 8,GABE VINCENT,"I think they competed really hard on both ends of the floor. Credit to them. Credit to the way they came out and fought. I think we had a slight lack of intention, a slight lack of spacing probably that we could do a little better on our part. They competed really well."
