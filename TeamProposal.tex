% Note that I am copying over the sections just as they are mentioned in the 
% instructions document. Feel free to change them up as you want.

\section{Task Overview --Item 2}
% Include title, significance and what makes it challenging.

\section{Task Definition --Item 3}
% Type of data, classification or regression, number of classes, single label
% or multi-label.

\section{Data Source and Plan for Data Collection --Item 4}
% May include how we are going to scrape the data and follow terms-of-service,
% API access and handling rate limiting, using open source data or any other 
% relevant details.
Our data will be interview transcripts on asapsports.com, specifically the responses given by the interviewees (players and/or coaches). We will write an automated web scraping script in Python to collect the transcript text.\\
\tab There is neither a terms of service nor a Robots Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt) file on the website, likely because the website doesnâ€™t get a lot of traffic. Since this is publicly available data taken from interviews, the biggest concern would be rate limiting. We would only need to scrape about 100 transcripts to meet our required number of data points, thus we can just limit the number of requests per second to not overload their servers.\\
\tab After tokenizing and removing unecessary information (e.g. interviewee name) we can store the corpus in a single file or multiple files for labelling purposes.

\section{Dataset Details --Item 5}
% Expected size of the dataset (number of data points) and 3 example data 
% points with labe;s assigned by your group. Should ideally have enough data 
% for several hours of annotation. This corresponds to a few thousand data 
% points.

\section{Team Contract --Item 6}
% Description of the expectations and/or roles that team members agree upon 
% for the semester. Part of final project grade will be based on whether 
% the teammates agree that we followed this contract. It should specify the
% overall purpose of the team, the responsibilities and the ground rules
% the team members agree to follow.

\subsection{Team Purpose}
% What is our team's purpose or mission?

\subsection{Team Member Roles}
% What are the duties/roles of each team member? What is expected of each 
% team member?

\subsection{Facilitation Activities}
% How will the team handle the leadership/facilitation/management activities?

\subsection{Anything Else?}
% Anything else we think will be helpful to set the group expectations.
% Print name, sign and date.
