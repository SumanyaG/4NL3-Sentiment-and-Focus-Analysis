2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,PACOME DADIET,"First, I would definitely say my brother, six years older. He was already playing basketball. But my first favorite player was probably KD.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,PACOME DADIET,"I think I'm really versatile, but I can also bring what a rookie needs to bring in a team. Bring some energy. Being able to grab a rebound, push the ball but also knock down shots. I think it's very important for a rookie to bring these things.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,PACOME DADIET,"I don't know anybody personally on the team. But I talked with the coach, yeah.",,1,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,PACOME DADIET,"And yeah, it was nice to see him. I'm used to seeing him on TV. It was a little different, but I enjoyed it.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I'm going to continue it do that, and I feel like that's going to help everybody else on the floor as well.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Right, to the efficiency point. I feel like that's huge for me, just because I like to play the right way. I feel like me playing the right way is me getting good shots, whether that's open shots or good layups at the rim. I feel like I'm just reading the game and adjusting to whatever the defense does. When I get a good look, it's more prone to go in than not.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"And then to your other point, hopefully we'll make it three. That would be really historic. Yeah, Colorado is not looked at as a draft pick-producing university like these other programs are. But if you look at the history, there's a lot of really, really solid players that have stuck around a long time in the league. It's just a testament to what Coach Boyle and his coaching staff have done at Colorado.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,TRISTAN DA SILVA,I'm excited to get to know them even more. We've got mutual friends. I've met them for the first time this past summer when my brother was playing on the national team and I went up there to Berlin to watch one of the games.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"But great people. They know my brother more than they know me, but they have already reached out to me through mutual friends. They make it very comforting to come to Orlando.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,ISAIAH COLLIER,"It's a blessing being here in the NBA Draft. One of many guys, and I'm just blessed to be in this space.",1,,1,

2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, I mean, I'm really proud of Steph, happy for Steph. As a freshman, for him to come in and do what he did, help lead that team to another national title, is something very hard to do as a freshman. I love that kid to death. I'm extremely happy for him, and I'll be his biggest fan this year.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,I just want to have an impact and try to help this organization win and get to the top and try to win championships.,1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm really excited. I feel the connection with some of these young guys I've watched since I was in high school. Scoot Henderson, in particular. I feel like we have a chance to do something really special.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm young. Having a young team, just growing up around the same age, everyone learning and getting better every day, I'm really excited. I feel like I'm at a loss for words right now. I don't even know what else to say. I'm just excited and extremely blessed for this opportunity, and I'm really ready to get to Portland and get to work.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Being able to space the floor, knock down the three ball, playmake at a high level. I feel like I can handle the ball at the top of the key, pass the ball at a high level and I can shoot the ball at a high level.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,One thing about me is I want to be a great teammate. I want to be the best teammate. I want to be the best player that Coach wants to coach every day. Coach is happy about coaching him because he gives his all. I want to be that guy. I'm just ready to get to work.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"That was a really special moment. Like I said, I'm extremely blessed and grateful for everyone that has helped me to get to this point. I'm ready to get to work and ready to learn and ready to try to impact winning.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yes, I just did.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"It was great. I like Coach a lot. When I went out there for my visit, he was a good dude, great dude. The whole staff, the whole organization, you can really tell people that want to learn and want to win and learn and get better. That's something -- that's what I'm about, and I'm really ready to go get going.",1,,,1

2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it just shows that we were the best program in college basketball and they still are right now. Coach Hurley is the best coach in college basketball, and he's producing players at a high level every single year.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm not sure the exact number of draft picks he's had these past five years, but Coach Hurley has been the top of the top in college for a couple years now. I love that man to death.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DONOVAN CLINGAN,No. Just spend some time with some family. Soak everything in. Realize my life is going to change forever.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just can't wait to get out there and show my versatility, especially with the kind of talent that we already have on that team. It being the youngest team in the league right now, I feel like our future is pretty bright. I just can't wait to get out there.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"It's really hard to prepare for that moment. I mean, it's just a lot of emotions running through your head, especially when you hear your name being called.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"But on the basketball side of things, just always keep your head down, always working. Just staying humble and just having all that self-confidence in myself that everything is going to work out.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,I was just playing for the best coach in college basketball and now flipping to the NBA and going to play for a legendary coach like Coach Pop. It's a blessing.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"On the culture side of things, it's not really a big culture change from UConn to San Antonio. Just being out there in the pre-draft process, you can tell it's a hardworking program and super hard-nosed. I just can't wait to go out there and just show what I got.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"Everything is just happening like really, really fast. Just being in the natty, soaking in that moment with my teammates, that's a super big accomplishment. And flip over to a couple months later and you another one of your teammates are top-10 picks. It really means the world to me and I wouldn't trade this for anything.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"I just talked to him on the phone not too long ago. We were just talking about coming down to San Antonio and just can't wait to get to work, and just excited for our future and excited for this upcoming season.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"It means a lot. Me and D.C. have been through so much together. I was friends with him before I got to UConn, before I committed to UConn. I've known him forever now. I mean, I know how much he's been through.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"For that to happen, it's such a great reflection on our program and just it's a reflection on all the hard work that we've put in. It's really a blessing.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"Nah, he didn't tell me that as soon as I got drafted. That's probably a conversations we'll have a little later.",,1,,1

2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,The last thing I'll do in probably just celebrate with my family. I was born here in New York. So I have a lot of family here at the draft. Just doing whatever I can to show how much appreciation I have toward them for all their support right before I go out to San Antonio and start my next journey.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,"Well, I mean, what I picked for the draft, it wasn't intentional. But I guess it all really worked out. I guess I kind of manifested it to happen for me.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,STEPHON CASTLE,But I wasn't really expecting anybody in particular to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"Oh, man, just want to thank God first, first and foremost, just for putting me in this position. I was ready to get ready to work. Coming in day one, do all the dirty work we need to do to win. I think I'm a winning player. I'm a win-now type of player, being one of the older guys in the draft. Just having that experience from college, and like I said, just doing all the dirty work, rebounding, diving on the floor for loose balls and just anything we need to do to win.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"I would love to play alongside Malik Monk, De'Aaron Fox, I think we have a great big in Sabonis, probably one of best passers in the NBA from a big standpoint.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"I'm just ready to be a two-way, versatile player. Get stops on one end, and I can also create some offense not only for myself but my teammates on the other end.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, I did work out for the Kings. Honestly, one of my better workouts, I believe. I think we had a very fantastic meeting with everybody who made the decision to draft me. Just very thankful for that.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"Me and Coach Brown talked, how we see myself fitting in on the team, and just coachplayer talk. I think I got a good feel for Coach and he got a good feel for me. Just ready to start in journey.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"It means everything. Just seeing his face whenever I got drafted, how happy he was, he didn't get a chance to get drafted. So just seeing his face and how excited he was for everything that we've been through, working out, countless hours throughout the night, morning. It's just a very special moment. Came up with handshake today and almost messed it up, but it's all right. We got it done.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, just me being confident, like I said, I know the type of player I am. I know what I bring to the court. I know I just wanted to give Kim the same promise he gave me when he first came to Providence, that he'll make me one of the better players in the conference. Just want to give him the same promise I got a seat for you at the green room table.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,DEVIN CARTER,"Just a mature, win-now, do-it-all type of player. Like I said, rebounding, dive on the floor, take charges, anything that is needed to do to win. Just very excited to play with some great players, and hopefully we can win a championship.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,BUB CARRINGTON,"I'm feeling about as good as you think I'd be feeling. It's a special feeling to finally be here and have my name called, and especially being so close to home. You know, that means a lot.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,BUB CARRINGTON,"It means a lot. Definitely because I would say when I was younger, I wasn't really like that in my area, and to now be sort of that guy that people want to see, especially being from the area and now back in the area. It means a lot to finally see all the stuff that I've done come to light.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,BUB CARRINGTON,I haven't even touched my phone yet.,,1,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,BUB CARRINGTON,"Definitely. Yeah, I'm pretty sure he has texted me already.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,BUB CARRINGTON,"For sure, yeah, he ain't got no choice.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,BUB CARRINGTON,"I would say the biggest adjustment would be how they game plan. It's real strategic for the league. I'm starting to see that working out for all these different teams. They have a real game plan and strategy going into every single game, and if you don't execute it, you can't play. I feel like that's something I'm going to have to get adjusted to.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,MATAS BUZELIS,Feeling good. Super blessed. I'm ready to work. I'm going to give the Bulls organization everything I've got.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,MATAS BUZELIS,"Super excited, man. I mean, this is a dream come true. I've been thinking about this since a young age. It means the world to me.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,MATAS BUZELIS,"I'll dress well, but I'm worried about basketball. I'm not really worried about that. I want to win.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,MATAS BUZELIS,"Chicago is a winning program and I want to win. So being there, I can embrace it. I fit many different ways on the team. I feel like I can do everything on the court. Whatever Coach asks me to do, I'm going to do to the best of my abilities and I'm going to work hard.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,MATAS BUZELIS,See my family. That's it.,1,,,1
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,MATAS BUZELIS,"The program did an amazing job, even when they had the shutdown. Look at all the picks that they had. Everyone is good. All the coaches are amazing. They did a great job with everyone that they produced. I can't thank them enough, honestly. I would do it ten times over again.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"It was amazing, amazing to be able to be in this position. After everything that happened last year with me and the injury and everything, you learn more to appreciate and cherish the moments and opportunity you're given. Tonight was one of those times where you just realize being in a locker room full of some greats in the NBA and the best players in the world and be able to be out here and be able to represent my country and my organization, I just wanted to cherish this moment and make the most of it.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,I didn't know it was going to be 50. I thought maybe it was going to be more like 15. But God is good. It's Sunday. I'm blessed to be in this situation.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"It's great. Like I said, it's a huge honor. It's all because of my teammates. My teammates tonight kept finding me and passing me the ball.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I just was trying, like I said, to take advantage of the opportunity and make some shots. I wish I could have made a little more, but beggars can't be choosers on a night like this.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"Indy is great. Indy is such a pinnacle of basketball. I had such love for Indy watching them. For me growing up, Reggie Miller was the guy that just was electric to me, especially his shooting. So to be able to be in the house that Reggie Miller, Larry Bird, Jermaine O'Neal, Ron Artest -- you know, we could keep going down the list. Even people like Monta Ellis, I want to give a shoutout to.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"To be in the building where they had historical moments, it's really special.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"Absolutely. Like I told him on the court, GOAT. He's one of those guys that probably will never come again. The talent, his ability to overcome all adversity and his ability to exceed people's expectations. Just tremendous respect for LeBron, tremendous respect for what he's done and the impact he's had on the game of basketball.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I'm just -- it's crazy. I'm just blessed to be with -- I have no kids, but I tell my niece and my nephew that they get to see their uncle playing with LeBron James, it's a really cool experience for those children to have those childhood memories.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I knew I had a lot, but I knew Ant was the one as always -- it's always Ant -- was looking at me saying -- he was breaking down the points to me on the bench. I knew it was something special because even Steph got up and was like, Get 50! Get 50!",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I hadn't been shooting the three ball well all night, but when I needed them to go in, they definitely did. God was good. I just was honored to be in the moment. I definitely tried to go the reverse through the legs. I couldn't make it in the All-Star Game, but I made it in a real game. Kind of funny how I did that.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KARL-ANTHONY TOWNS,"I've really got to say, I think it was great coaching. The play calls and stuff like that, they're fantastic. I would love possibly one day to be able to play for this coaching staff if everything lines up.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"I remember I was standing there like I never met Larry Bird. I've never been in the same room with him. As crazy as it sounds, it's never worked out.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"So Taylor, our PR girl, saw him before -- I was sitting on the sidelines, and she grabbed me. She was like, He's over there. I got a chance to go meet him and tell him how much of an honor it was to meet him. He told me he was looking forward to meeting me. So that was crazy to hear him say that.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"He's a lot taller than I thought he was. But obviously what he means to the game, what he means to the city of Boston and the Celtics, he's the ultimate Celtic. It was an honor to meet him.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"All-Star Weekend is special, and it's always more special when you get to share it with a teammate or two. I've been fortunate enough to share it with him three times now. It was great. It was great to have a teammate, familiar face around, especially we get to share the same locker room.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"It's a special weekend for us, for our families, obviously for our team, the Celtics. So it's always great.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"Much deserved. Like you said, we scored 200 points. We had three guys score over 36 points, so it could have went either way. But Dame put on a show. I was happy for him. It was cool that I could take a backseat this year and kind of chill and get to enjoy the show a little bit.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"Actually, I got to talk to him before the game started. The time difference is a little crazy. He actually is up -- he's a Finalist for Coach of the Year. He started off as an assistant coach, and the head coach got let go, and halfway through the season.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"They were like in the 10th or 11th seed, and how he kind of turned around. They're in the 4th seed going into the playoffs. Extremely obviously happy for him. Happy for what he's been able to do over there and kind of turn that organization around.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,He loves it. He loves it over there. He loves being in Australia. He says the games are extremely competitive. The atmosphere is crazy. Hopefully they can continue and go all the way. But it's been great to see him turn that thing around and have a lot of success over there.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"Meeting Larry, it was super quick. I had told him it was an honor to meet him, and he told me he was looking forward to finally get to meet me. Then we took a picture. So we didn't get to talk in detail.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"It's extremely important. Being an All-Star is obviously a reflection of the work that you've put in your whole life, the work that you've obviously put in the first half of the season, but it should be celebrated with your family. Nobody is successful by themselves. Everybody has a support group, people to help raise them, support them through ups and downs.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"I loved it. The shorter introductions, not being on the stage and all that, I'm definitely a fan of that.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"East versus West, I thought it was cool. This is my first All-Star Game experience in East versus West. So that's kind of what I grew up watching. I enjoyed that.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I liked it better this year honestly. It was a regular game. Halftime was a little shorter, and the introductions was a lot shorter. So it felt like a little bit more normal of a game than past years.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"I think it's my responsibility. I understand the platform that I have and the position that I'm in. I'm in a position to inspire a lot of kids and a lot of people, and I think, as we all were inspired by somebody. I feel like, as you grow up, you should always keep that in mind, that somebody inspired you to get where you are today.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"The larger your platform, I feel like the larger your responsibility is. Growing up from St. Louis, I always had it in my mind that I wanted to impact my community. I wanted to change and make St. Louis a better place than when I grew up. I didn't always know how to articulate that when I was younger, but from a very young age, I knew that I was going to be where I'm at today, and that I was going to inspire kids and help change lives back where I'm from.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"No. Honestly, I don't really shoot one-legged threes. It was really a spur of the moment. I just saw LeBron is in front of me, and I figured why not go ahead and shoot a one-legged shot.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"Fortunately, I've been around a few times, so it wasn't my first time. But it's always a blessing, especially for the older guys. You've got Steph, LeBron, KD. Those three in particular, those are Hall of Famers, top-tier guys. It's always a blessing to share the court. As long as you can, you treasure those moments. Hopefully I'm talked about in the same category as my career continues to move forward.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DONOVAN MITCHELL,It never gets old. You just find ways to enjoy each moment and embrace it.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"I told him he should have went for it before we started the game. He is back from injury, so he tried to pace it, I guess. I told him go ahead and go get it. He started off hot. Dame got going. There was a lot of scoring tonight.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DONOVAN MITCHELL,"Not at halftime, there was no talk of it. That's the thing with athletes, though. You kind of have this within the game, and you could see it out there. Karl was going for it, J.B., Dame. You can see it. I think that's what makes it special, because now you've got guys taking shots and putting themselves in certain categories.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,Appreciate it.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I just told myself I'm going to be aggressive, and I'm going to keep firing. I saw a couple go in. After that, it was just like I'm going after it. So that was it.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"The first one, I was super, super loose. Then the last one, I was actually kind of stiff. So I just had to shoot it a little bit higher. I got two of them in.",,1,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Our coach was the coach. So a lot of our staff was around the whole time. I think it was just a positive weekend for us because we just had a lot of interactions. We were able to have conversations about where our team has been lately and what we want to do, how we can help each other better.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think, when you can break away from not only the season and have All-Star break, but also break away from the team and us be able to just be man to man and kind of just bond like that, it's always helpful.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Like you said, me being able to come here and see how he's viewed around the league and him also to be able to come here and see how I'm viewed around the league. I think that just helps with any type of dynamic when you're trying to accomplish what we're trying to accomplish.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think people who are fans of the game, they love it. They enjoy being entertained. I think it could be more competitive. I think in our game right now it's such a fast-paced game. We play a lot of games. The game has probably also had more injuries than it's ever had.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Trying to manage everybody, trying to protect yourself and not get injured and take away from what you ultimately want to accomplish, I think is something we prioritize. But it's a lot that goes on when you come here for this game.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think 200 is a lot to be scored. It just shows that we didn't go out there and compete like I guess you would want us to or whoever would want us to. But I think that's just what it is. Guys are talented. Make a lot of shots. We hit a lot of threes, and that was it.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Any time you're mentioned in the same category as Mike, it's an honor, and it's a major accomplishment, even if it's All-Star Weekend. If it was that simple, more people would have done it since 1988. So that's a major compliment for me to be mentioned in the same conversation as far as that.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Like you said, it's been a tough year, just the transition, being on a new team. We've had three coaches since I've been there. We've had coaches leave. Moving across the country. I've been on the West Coast my whole life with my whole family right there, just a tight group always in place.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think any time you have these types of experiences where you have an adversity and things not just flowing like you expect it to or like you would want it to, I think that's the time you've got to just show who you really are. You've got to keep doing what you do, keep believing. When you do that, usually it comes back to you. There's some type of reward that comes forward.",,1,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"You can't just fold. And that's what my mentality is. I did come into the weekend, when I knew I was going to do the 3-Point, I was like I'm going to try to win. I'm not going to be casual and cool about it. I'm going to try to win again.",,1,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"And I'm going to come into the All-Star Game, my first start, I know I'm going to be on the floor a lot. I'm a vet in the game at this point. Why not go and try to get an MVP? Since I've been here enough.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I saw the ball go in, and I started to do that. But I wouldn't say it was validation. It's just something I put my mind on, and that's going to be what my intentions are this weekend, and I was able to do it.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think something could be done about it. I'm not sure what, but I think there's a way to make it a more competitive game. I don't think anybody is going to play in it like it's the playoffs, but it's a way to get guys to come to the table and just play a more solid game, I guess.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"But I did think it was a good game. Any time the crowd is engaged and you're hearing oohs and aahs and things like that because, if the crowd isn't enjoying what they're seeing, they're not going to say nothing. I've seen it. They'll just sit there and watch.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I think this is the most success I've probably had in one All-Star Weekend. Had a few launches with some of my partners, won the 3-Point, won the All-Star Game MVP. So it's been a successful weekend. I think any time you get to be a part of this, that's what anybody would want.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"But going forward, it's just like you've got to recharge and get ready for the closing stretch and try to just get our team to where we need to be so we can go after what we want to accomplish this season.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,It's just been an absolute honor to be able to grace the floor throughout my career and be out there with the greatest players in the world year in and year out.,1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"This is very humbling, very blessed, and it's something I will never forget obviously. It's part of my journey.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I won't be playing the entire game tonight, for sure. I can get out there and run around with the young guys for a little bit and then shut it down at some point to give my body, and my ankle more importantly, another opportunity to rest.",,1,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I'm seeking some more treatment tomorrow going into this week, because we have quite a few days this week as well. We don't play until the end of the week. See how that goes. But the most important thing for me is definitely my health, where I'm at right now, where our team is leaning. We're trending in the right direction.",,1,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"Obviously, with our Laker team, it's been about health all year. Trying to do what's best for me for the betterment of the team.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"Yes. I think for me, I can affect the game in a lot of ways. At this point in my career, it's still the same way. I can affect the game by being on the ball, being off the ball, cutting from the weak side, slashing from the weak side, running in transition. I have the ability to shoot the ball in space at more frequency at a higher level than I was early in my career. So I've worked on that.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"My mind is just sharper than anything. It's allowed me to go out there and sometimes just outthink the game and not have to physically be imposing out on the floor for 40 minutes or 42, whatever the case may be that I'm out there. I could pick my spots.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I guess each team is going to dictate what your defense allows you to do or what you want to take away. At the end of the day, we're All NBA players, and you can't take away everything. Guys are going to score, guys are going to shoot threes, guys are going to put up numbers. It's what you're willing to give up, not what you want to take away.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"Every team is different. Every team's portfolio is different of how they attack the game. If you do your scouting, if you do your research, you know players' tendencies, you can be proactive more than reactive.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"You're absolutely right, the game that's definitely got to, because of analytics, when that tapped into our game, it's more just like layups, dunks, free throws, threes. A lot of teams are trying to shy away from the midrange. A lot of teams are trying to shy away from a lot of other things that, when I came into the league, that was very important.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"Depending on the teams that you're playing, you know the teams that want to shoot 40, 50 threes a game. You know the teams that want to shoot 25 to 30. You just have to do your scouting and be prepared for it.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I still at heart and like deep inside, I'm still like that 18-year-old kid that came into this league from Akron, Ohio, which is like you don't really have many inspirations. You've got to grab it from somebody, and it's usually like a family member or a basketball coach or a football coach or a teacher or somebody like that. It's not many people that make it on TV or make it to doing special things that you think is special.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"Yeah, I mean, I told myself before the season when I committed to being a part of the Olympic team, obviously it was all predicated on my health. As it stands right now, I am healthy enough to be on the team and perform at a level that I knew I could perform at.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"Like you said, there's still time left in the season, a third left in the regular season. Obviously, I don't know what the future holds as far as postseason, whatever the case may be. Like you said, it's 11 games, but it is 5 12 weeks, and it's more miles put on these tires.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I've always -- if I'm committed, which I am, to Team USA, then I'm going to commit my mind, body and soul to being out there for Team USA, being out there representing our country with the utmost respect and go out and play.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"But the one thing I know for sure, I don't have to carry the load. I've never had to carry the load on any one of the three teams I've been on, the '04 team, the '08 team and the '12 team. I just try to do my best and be as great as I can be on the floor in the minutes I'm out there.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I'm not sure right now what the full team is going to look like, but from some of the names, I know I don't have to feel any pressure going out there to feel like I have to carry the team. That's going to be a full 12-man roster that's capable of doing it both offensively and defensively on any given night versus any country in the world.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"To your question, there's so much scoring in this league. You can't really put your hands on people too much. I think there's guys that have learned that ability to get to the free throw line very frequently out on the floor. You have guys shooting 20 -- I've seen guys shoot 15 to 20 threes in a game.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"We have some great scorers in this game, that when you see guys putting up 50s, 60s, 70s, it's like you're watching the game, you're like, oh, man, he either had a heater, he caught fire. You've seen guys this year scoring like 40 in the first half.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I don't know, you've got so many great talents in this league. Would I sit here and say I think guys can score 80 or 90? Yeah, why not? It's been done before. Talent is talent no matter what generation it is. '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s all the way until now, talent is talent, and great basketball and great scorers are going to be great scorers no matter what era they're in. Once a great scorer gets going, there's really nothing you can do.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I know you've asked this question before, and a lot of you guys have asked, what does it feel like to be in a zone? Once a guy's in a zone, there's nothing you can do. If a guy decides he wants to stay in the zone, or you've seen Caitlin the other night when she broke the record, there's nothing you can do. There's nothing you can do.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"If the game's flowing at a very good pace and you've got a heater from the midrange, you've got a heater from the free throw line, you're shooting threes, you shoot 15 threes, you make 10 of them, that's 30 right there. You go to the free throw line 15 times and make another 13, 14, that's 43 points right there. You could very easily make another 10, 12, 15 points from two-point land and just be at 60, 70, 80.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,"I think it's possible. I mean, we've seen Kobe. We've seen Kobe do it. Kobe -- obviously, I'm not going to put too many guys on Kobe's level, but when you have a hot streak, we've seen Kobe live put up 81. I think it could be done.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,Of course you get a bonus question. You don't have to ask that. Of course.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LEBRON JAMES,I am. I promise you.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,I'm feeling okay. I definitely wasn't going to put too much pressure on the game tonight for me physically. I want to try to be as healthy as I can be physically. This last part of the season is very important for us. I got to make sure of that.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"It possibly could. It depends on the recovery process. So possibly, but we will see.",,1,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"Still just my love for the game. I'm not pursuing anything, but my love for the game runs deep. Just trying to give everything I can to the game until I have nothing left, in the sense of just my love.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"It's not about the physical or things of that nature. It's just about the pure joy of going out and playing a game that I love. I know I don't have much time left, but while I'm out there, just trying to play with a lot of joy and a lot of fun.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"I don't know. I think it's something we need to figure out. Where is the median? This is what a lot of the games are starting to look like too. We wanted to get more pace into the games. We wanted to get more shots. We wanted the game to be more free flowing. We stopped letting the game -- be freedom of movement, a lot of freedom of movement now. That's what our games are like in the regular season now.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"They let us tighten up in the postseason. It's a deeper dive into a conversation of how we can shore up this game. Obviously from a player's perspective, it's fun to get up and down. But at the end of the day, our competitive nature don't like to have free-flowing scoring like that.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"But I think the good thing that came out of tonight was none of the players were injured, and everybody came out unscathed or how they were before the game started. So it's a deeper conversation.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"One, I don't know, man, it's super surreal and super crazy and just very humbled and blessed that I can be able to still perform on the stage at this point in my career and be able to do some of the things that I did 20 years ago. I think that's pretty cool.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"I always acknowledge the greats. I understand the greats that came before me and the people that laid down the foundation for this sport to be as great as it is today. I happen to be a recipient of that. Because of Big O and so many other great players, obviously, if anybody know my history, they know how much I admire Big O, not only for what he contributed to the game, but also what he stood for off the floor as well.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"We've always had a really cool relationship, and every time I get an opportunity to see him, we just pick it back up where we left off. To see him tonight was a treat for me. I didn't expect to see him. I didn't know he was going to be here. So it was a treat for me to see him again.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"The kid is special. He's going to continue to get better and better. If he's doing that at 19 now, just imagine what he's going to look like at 21, 22. So a special kid.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"It's awesome. I remember my first All-Star Game and looking up and seeing the likes of Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant and Kevin Garnett and those guys, and I was just in awe. Just to see guys in their first All-Star Games, like you said, Paolo and the rest of the guys here, it's special. It's special for them.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"I think you saw the raw emotion that Jalen Brunson showed when they asked him after a Knick game how he felt being an All-Star. I think you saw the raw emotion, and that's how much he cares about being acknowledged and for him to be a first-time All-Star is just super cool.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"To be a part of their moment, because this is their moment, is something I can look back on and be like that was a cool moment.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,"For me, what I find is a silver lining is looking at my upbringing and looking at kids that are in situations that I was in when I was younger, trying to be an inspiration to them, letting them understand that there is a way out. I was one of the kids that made it out.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,LeBRON JAMES,I've shared a great relationship with the Philippines and TITAN and us having that -- we share some of the same core values. I always respected that even when I went over there and spent a lot of time in the Philippines in Manila.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,18-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"I think that, you know, for our team, we bounce back after a loss really, really well, and making sure that everybody is on the same page going forward.",,1,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,STEPHEN CURRY,"It's a great visual to see. It's a great comparison of body movement, ball movement, between the two sports. It's all about just flow and rhythm and chemistry. We've had a certain style that we've mastered that has evolved over the ten years he's been coaching. Yeah, it was a concerted effort to get us to play a certain way that would help us win. Obviously we've been able to do that.",1,,1,
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"Usually our preparation to get ready to compete, it looks a lot different than it looks when we come here. This weekend was a lot better than the past, but I think when the game is any type of loose, if it's not a game where you've got a scouting report and you're locked in and a lot is on the line, then guys who are too talented, are going to make a lot of threes. That's the kind of game it's going to be.",,1,1,

2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,DAMIAN LILLARD,"I thought it was enough moments to be excited about and enjoy watching. But it was probably too much leak-out, go get a dunk, go get a layup type of moments. If we could limit those, people wouldn't feel the way they feel sometimes about it, if we could just try to limit it. It's going to happen sometimes, but it probably can't happen as much.",,1,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I talked with him earlier today, or tonight. I'm super excited, just learning from one of the great coaches. I feel like there's a lot that I can expand my game in, and I can't wait to learn even more. I feel like talking basketball and talking basketball IQ is one of my passions, as well, in the game.

I vividly remember my freshman year during the bubble, we played Kentucky in the round of 32 and Tamika was calling the game and I was like tweaking out.
