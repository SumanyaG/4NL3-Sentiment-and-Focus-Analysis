2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I was really, really happy with Nyara. It was the plan to give her a few more extra minutes tonight. Stewie came in a little sooner because Stewie got two fouls early.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She played so hard. She was winded by the end of those seven minutes. We played her seven minutes in a row but she was so effective. Just the ability, they were being so aggressive, and what Nyara brings is she's always on her front foot getting downhill. She's always going to run the floor, just a hundred miles an hour, which is what we needed.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"So it's been great to see her growth, and yeah, it was never in doubt there. But obviously I went to Slooty early, too, and I thought that changed the pace of the game. We struggled a little bit. Not often do I sit both of these at the same time, very rarely. But I felt like we needed to at that moment, and I think they gave us really good energy.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We got it back to ten after that first quarter, and I think that was the thing. We've got to keep grinding, keep grinding, and as the game went on, we got back to playing Liberty Basketball.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"I'm disappointed that we let it get to 17. I'm more disappointed in that. I'm more than disappointed, I'm pissed that that happened again.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Sure, did.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It's hard. You have to adjust to the refs. Definitely it's not an excuse. We played really bad. I'm definitely not using that as an excuse.,,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,But it's hard to adjust because you are playing one way and you are getting used to the refs and then they change it up. But that's not why we lost. It wasn't them. It was us. Can't blame that.,,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,It's been talked about a lot. This is a group that problem solves well together. They never think they are out of it. Their belief in themselves and their belief in each other is top-notch. And we know it's a long game. They are very experienced.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"We just knew what we had to clean up, get some things cleaned up and we did that then. Put ourselves in position, right where we wanted to be and just couldn't get over the hump.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,So it didn't affect us.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Huge difference. So both games they have gotten help from part of their -- they have a big five, right, their starters are all very capable, just like our starters are all very capable and you need players beyond your stars, and for two games, they have done that. We're having trouble getting that consistently and we've got to have that.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I mean, yeah, obviously you want to steal one on the road. We're really disappointed I think in how we played today but excited to go home and play in front of our crowd, and we have to respond. We have to come out playing better than we did in these two games.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I honestly don't feel like I changed my mindset. I feel like I stayed aggressive on defense. I was frustrated that I had those four fouls but I don't think it affected me in the way that I was playing.,,1,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"No, I happen to agree with you. I had a chance to talk to Joe Ingles, I don't know if I told Lan this when we were in Minnesota, and he asked me how I liked my Australian. And we talked about all the ways that we love the way that Lan plays and her level of compete, and that's what Joe said. He's like, one thing you're darned sure an Australian is going to do is compete their tails off.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"And Lan is the very definition of that. Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how difficult it is. Lan is always there for us in that way.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"We were trying to get another ball handler out there, somebody they had to pay attention to, try to get downhill a little bit, try to create some easier opportunities playing with flow. Setups weren't necessarily producing anything for us, so we just thought, spread the floor and play with two ball handlers.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Well, I mean, what did she have at half, 12? Ten of them were in fast break. Ten of them were fast break. So what changed is she wasn't able to get it in the fast break and we had her in the halfcourt.",,1,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,I think Stewie is the same. I don't think making her missing a shot or free throw. We do this long enough that those things happen. She's resilient. She played exactly like we thought she would. I thought she played great in Game 1.,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"And so you know, I think her impact defensively was something that we felt. You know, what did she have, seven steals? And so you know, she's been doing that in these playoffs.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"More than that, in my mind -- you have to ask Stewie, but I don't think that's what was on her mind. I think what was on their collective minds is it's a must-win game for them and they came out and played like it was, and they took the game.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, but I think the opponent has a fair amount to do with it. We have to come up with better opportunities and better things that we can do offensively so that we can get back to a little bit more of a balanced scoring.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,So I think that's most important to say is New York has had a lot to do with this.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"You've got players that are playing a lot of minutes, a lot of heavy minutes, and any time you can get your bench to come in and be productive and you can keep them out there longer, that's an advantage.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"But I don't think either bench has been necessarily a separator. We talked about Hiedeman in the last game. She scored it. I think she had ten, right. So that was impactful.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"But you know, both teams are looking for anywhere else you can go so that you don't have all this pressure on your top players.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"What we continued to keep saying to one another was like stay together, keep playing. Every rebound matters. And even if our offense gets a little bit stagnant and funky, we are not going to let that dictate what we do defensively.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, massive. They have been going under on screens so we encouraged her to shoot the three. She's a great three-point shooter. She was stroking it yesterday in practice before the game.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, she was digging deep and that's what we needed. We knew we needed to bounce back and it was a big bounce-back game. They contained Leonie a little bit after what she did in Game 1 but B helped us get this margin to win the game.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. Just like not letting history repeat itself and knowing that Game 1 happened but now, you know, how can we control Game 2 and I think that honestly the thought process was, we were trying to be up a little bit more. Like not letting them get to the three-point line to set up their offense. And then in to out, whether I'm helping, I know that Sab or whoever else is helping on my backside, and making them have to move just a little bit quicker than they want to.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"I kind of texted him and I was like, you know what it's about time that you come to my game. I've been here for two years and he hasn't come down. What are you doing? Yeah, CD Dailey came and she got that same message, too.",,1,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a long drive.,,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,Two hours.,,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B brings is this grit, this toughness, knowing that -- and all of us know, she's giving us whatever she's got, and the way that she continued to be aggressive, they were going under on her and she knocked that thing down with confidence, got into the paint, drive and kicks.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,But that's what we're used to. We know she can do this and happy to see her get into a good rhythm with everything that's been up and down this season and know that she's a big factor in everything we do.,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"That's really what my goal was, was just take what the defense gives me and not forcing anything but understanding I'm going to be able to drive and kick. And players hit, multiple players hit really big shots. But obviously I think coming out like that was great for us to get going.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"And then in the second half, they made some adjustments and I think it was understanding being able to drive passing lanes and find the open man, if they are going to bring a few on the ball.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,So I just did that. I don't always need to be looking to score every single time I have the ball. Just continue to make the right read and understanding what it is that provides our best offense as a team.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think everyone has seen her. She's been struggling but she's been feeling good these last few days, can tell you that much. She has been.",,1,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We just knew it was a bit of time. We've given her so much rest here and she was ready to go. She puts the work in. Like I said, she's tough. We talked about the grittiness that she gives us.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But it's great that you put the ball in her hand and be more of a playmaker, because it takes a little bit more pressure off these two in particular. I thought that was very effective for us. But her defense, she was everywhere. She was guarding everyone. I'm really happy for her. We just have to freshen up and get ready for the next game.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B and I were continuing to say in the huddles was defensively, you know, the schemes because they went small. So it means our matchups are a little bit different. And making sure that we have each other's help. If we are weak side, who is high, who is low. Just those type of things, and knowing that like scores and stops, we're playing the long game in the last two minutes, and making sure that we are all are on the same page.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I mean, I think we missed her grittiness and just she's the ultimate competitor. She takes pride -- she used to always guard the best player and obviously now we have Leo, too, that makes us really a versatile defensive team.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But you also miss her play-making. That's something we talked about this year. We wanted to make sure she could play-make more and it was hard for to play-make when she was hobbling around with the knee. We need her to get confidence first, and then to go out and play.",,1,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"She's just impactful because she plays at both ends of the floor, and plays hard, and she's a winner. So happy that she got the success tonight and keep building on it.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Well, I'm not from here.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a full house tonight. It was really loud.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,Largest crowd ever.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Loudest.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,BREANNA STEWART Largest.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,SANDY BRONDELLO Largest.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,She's not from here.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,I'm not from here. Loudest? Largest.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'm not from here. It's great. We talked about the winner is women's basketball, WNBA. So many fans coming out to watch these amazing players play, but yeah, they are all welcome. All coaches.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,My coach is coming to Minnesota.,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think the moment the game ended Thursday night, I was looking forward to Sunday, just to be able to kind of change things, change the narrative a little bit, and know that I'm going to come out and be the same that I was and be obviously better.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"It was the difference in this last game. I think that especially after watching the film of Game 1, we slowed down to a pace that is a little bit awkward for us. We want to play fast and we want to move the ball and we want to get downhill and we want to score, obviously.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"So making sure that no matter what, we continue to play fast, we get good shots and we get that defense moving.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"Understanding how teams are playing me and being able to make that adjustment in real time. Possession by possession, quarter by quarter, teams have kind of changed the way they have guarded, whether they are switching, hedging, trapping. And I think being able to just be poised and understanding what it is that I need to do in order to create an advantage for the team that we have out there on the floor is what I've always wanted to do, and I feel like I've been able to do that in a really good spot.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,Obviously my teammates set really good screens and are able to get me open in order for me open to create for them.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"I'd say it worked pretty well for us, understanding that we use our big lineup and knowing that, you know, we can get the ball inside. We can switch. We're able to apply pressure defensively with our length and being able to get steals and just disrupt their flow.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"But obviously it's a series and it's a chess match and they are going to throw different adjustments, and I think our ability to stay poised and being able to kind of see what it is that they are doing in real time is going to be crucial.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,Now we have seen their small ball lineup and we're going to go back and find ways that we can execute while they have that group on the floor.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we weren't happy the way we played we and we talked about our principles of play. We have it on our wall, there's a way that we want to play when we are at out best, when we are at pace and moving it, setting good screens and getting second and third side when we need it, but with a good inside-outside attack. We came out, and I think that was very effective for us.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,We always want to try to get the ball to JJ. They bring a lot of congestion and we probably would have liked to put it in more cleaner in some areas but she demands so much attention down there. I thought the are best thing was obviously just getting on the boards. I think she was fantastic for us.,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And that's what we need. You know, some games you are going to get more touches than other games and shoot but it's more about playing in the right way and sharing the ball and good to great. I think shot selection wasn't great last game. So it's about making those adjustments and continue to play the way that we want to play.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was thinking no, no, she's up -- no, no, she's going to shoot it. But a three-point shot is a layup for her. We encourage her to shoot all those threes. I know she missed one just before it. But I love the confidence that she brings.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, you know, I think kind of piggybacking off of the question that I answered from Pepper, it's understanding when I'm getting into the paint, the defense has to make a decision. They are either going to come and take me or they are going to play, you know two on one on the back side, and there's Leo and B in the corner, and as a defender, you just have to take your pick between the two.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"I was able to just drive in, look her off, and obviously B -- a corner three for B is a layup as well. She shoots that at a really high clip and really well. So I kind of baited Alanna Smith into thinking I was going to pass it high. And B hit a huge shot for us that changed the momentum of the game and continued to extended the lead. I think they called a time-out a little bit after that. It was huge for us.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"We believe in her. She knows that. This was a huge game. She played a huge role in the game ending up the way that it did and she's going to continue to do it for these next two games, we know that.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I think we've been in these moments before on opposing court when it gets really, really loud, and it's more about making sure we stay true to who we are. We kind of know how we want to play. We know that they are going to make runs. We know the crowd is going to get into it.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But we've just got to continue to play -- stay true to who the New York Liberty are, and if we can do that, we can overcome any obstacle.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We have had great starts in both games, but I thought our -- how much they were talking in the huddle, you know, it wasn't just me talking all the time. They're going ""We have got to rebound. The possession game.""",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We kept Minnesota to 27 points in that second half, that's pretty good. And some of our scramble defense, we were down 1-0. So you know, we should be playing like that. And now we can tidy up some things and they can tidy up some things as well, too. We'll look forward to playing another tough game on Wednesday.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I mean, I think we embrace it. We like it when it's loud. We like it when it's difficult. You know, as we did tonight when it's so loud that you can't hear, you know, just expecting that when we go to Minnesota, hopefully it's going to be an incredible atmosphere for both of those games.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"But just continuing to stick together, and I think also, the biggest thing behind it is like not getting too high or too low, you know. Things are going to seem bigger than what they are because they are playing at home, and I'm sure Minnesota said the same thing when they are playing here.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"But yeah, we like to go on the road.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, obviously I stayed up watching the game, not too late laughter.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"But it was a nail-biter. But I mean, after they won the way that they did, today I was like, yeah, I'm going to wear my Oregon shoes because I wanted to embody that tough, gritty win that they pulled off, which is probably one of the biggest wins that our program has had there.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"A lot of things didn't go right for them and they just continued to fight and stay together and grind out a really big win. I was like, all right, I want to bring that energy with me today on the court and kind of do the same thing.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,Lucky shoes.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"I think it defines our team in terms of being able to get through difficult times. That's what we say, we've been talking about, all these interviews we've been given, that's what we are talking about You have to be mentally tough and resilient. You have to look inward and not blame other people, and give each other confidence.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"And we were that team. You know, thrilled that we could hang in there.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I mean, he believes in us like we believe in ourselves. I think we have such a tight-knit circle with our families involved as well, and we all know what we can do in that. We never give up.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,He embodies all of our families. They all believe that we can come back and we can win and we can stay composed and hopefully win. The basketball gods were on our side tonight.,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"That's just a testament to how we believe in each other. We have so many great three-point shooters, and the fact that these girls are out here trying to get me the ball, I mean, I could cry. This is amazing. I love it.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I say that all the time, and I don't say that for fun. These people I'm around, we believe in each other so much. It's crazy, man. I'm happy to be here.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"From a basketball standpoint, Courtney recognized that she had to get more aggressive. Not pick up her dribble. Her team needed her to be aggressive to go score the basketball. We needed some help. Phee got going as well. But Courtney has been around for a while. She has been in Finals games, and she knows her team needed her to get aggressive.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I think just taking it one possession at a time. We've been in situations where we've been down before, and that's when we really lean on our defense. That's something we were talking about, getting three stops in a row, chipping at it a little bit at a time. Not thinking about the point difference, but thinking about the possession that we need to get a stop and a score. That's just what we were talking about at halftime.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It just goes in preparation. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us and playing tendencies and just playing defense.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I don't know where it ranks. It's 1 right now because we are here. I like to be where my feet are planted. So it's 1 right now.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,Laughing.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"That helped her a little bit, clutch free throws, that was good.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I messed that up laughing.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,I didn't feel that way. Those are your words.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"We know it's a long series. Nothing is won in the first quarter. It was not the first quarter that we were hoping for. What our narrative was in the timeouts was just we had to find our footing. Find our footing defensively, and we did the second quarter. We held them to 12 after giving up 32. We went into halftime in good shape.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"No question about it, the second-chance points are really, really disappointing. That could have really cost us, and we were very, very fortunate that we overcame that. But defensively, we knew what we had to get done. Once our offense improved a little bit and we stopped turning the ball over.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,But they played terrific. I thought New York played terrific. Their pace was terrific. They run so many great things. They are unique in what they do. They found JJ repeatedly. She had a tremendous game. We had to overcome a lot.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"And then you look up at the end, and you know, we held them below 40 percent, which is monumental. A lot of that was obviously late. We got big stops when we needed them. Repeatedly, whether ball is going out of bounds or 5050 balls, referees, whatever happens, jump balls, fouls, all that stuff, we just had to be gritty at the end. We had to get stops to win and that's what I'm proud of.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Well said. Alanna is one of our highest WARP players, if you're into analytics. She's one of our highest. You know, like you said, she's not going to wow you. She's not going to fly around, scoring the ball, making post moves. It's not her. But what she does for our team, both offensively and defensively, it's not underappreciated, I can tell you that. It's a little bit understated. People have to really watch to recognize what she does for us. Fighting through. Every night, she's playing against the opposing team's big, and she's not big. And so if you look at the success that she has in doing that, it's the reason why we're sitting here today in the Finals. She's Second Team All-Defense, along with Collier as Defensive Player of the Year. Those two are the heart and soul of our defense.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"No, it is the margin. It is the margin. But I hear what you're saying, in that when it mattered, we got some hustle plays. And we always say, you never know which one is going to be the difference between winning and losing.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"If the bigs weren't rebounding, might as well go small. Couldn't get any worse, right? What we wanted was a couple ball handlers, get downhill, try to get some easier stuff and pace, etc. That was actually, I don't know if it was Katie Smith or Rebekkah Brunson, but it was something that they asked for and it was a really good call.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it felt like we got a second chance. Obviously you don't want to be put in that position. Wish I wouldn't have fouled. Wish it wouldn't have been called, whatever it was.",,1,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,"But yeah, you're not thinking about that in the second. You're just thinking making sure they didn't get the rebound, making sure we're boxing out and going to our next play. So yeah, that's what I was thinking about.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,I didn't know she was here.,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"She was texting to the bench. A lot of the good stuff we did, she was sending laughter.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"The games that we were talking about, we were up. We were managing leads. We weren't finishing well. The fundamental difference is we were down. So obviously we finish games better when we're down, based on the playoffs.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"But that was what I was referring to, was managing leads better, playing all the way through to the end of the game.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,Welcome to Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. I'm excited to be here in New York City as the Liberty take on the Minnesota Lynx.,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you all know, the Liberty and Lynx were the two best teams in the WNBA all year, with both at the top of the standings for much of the season. The Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, are making their second straight Finals appearance and looking to win their first WNBA championship. Obviously, they won the Commissioner's Cup the other year 2023. The Lynx, one of the most decorated franchises in WNBA history, are looking to win a league-record fifth title and are appearing in a record seventh Finals. They're looking to become the second team to sweep both the Commissioner's Cup and the WNBA Finals trophy.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With Napheesa having such a career year, along with the play in New York with Sabrina and Stewie and the storylines about Leonie Fiebich, her first year in the league, All-Rookie Team, and free-agency signings in Minnesota with Courtney Williams and Alanna Smith and so many more storylines, I'm just excited to get this tipped off.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Finals mark the culmination of what I think is the most transformational year in the WNBA's history. You saw all the statistics we put out viewership, attendance, merch sales, digital engagement at or near record levels. To put it in perspective with a few stats that bring insight into what has happened, the WNBA has significantly outpaced the industry in average consumption of live games in 2024. Fans watched 30 percent more minutes on average of each WNBA game in the 2024 regular season.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Our focus on our direct-to-consumer platforms led to record-breaking content consumption and repeated fan engagement. WNBA App downloads surpassed 1 million this year, and monthly active users skyrocketed 252 percent. Social engagement increased nearly 300 percent across all of our league channels. There was an astounding 872 percent increase in WNBA App story views, which I know I watch my kids watching all the little stories that we put out there.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Last time we gathered for the Finals, in 2023, we had just announced the Golden State expansion franchise. Since then, we have announced two more expansion teams to begin play in 2026, Toronto and Portland, with one more team to begin play by no later than the 2028 season, to get us to 16 teams.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This summer we signed a groundbreaking media rights deal that will grow the economics of our league and expand the reach and accessibility of our game for our fans, with additional WNBA media deals to come.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"As you know, early in the season, after seeing the growth trajectory we were on and with a challenging game footprint given the Olympics, we implemented full charter flights for the entire season plus playoffs.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This growth has not come without growing pains. The hateful speech and threats directed at our players are troubling. That type of conduct is not representative of the WNBA's character or fan base. As a league, we stand united in condemning racism and all forms of hate. The WNBA is one of the most inclusive and diverse professional sports leagues in the world, and we will continue to champion those values.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll meet with the Players Association, the players, teams. We'll work together to expand and enhance our efforts and are going to approach this multidimensionally, utilizing technology, prioritizing mental health, reinforcing physical security and increasing monitoring. We know there's more work to be done, and as a league, we are fully committed to listening to the players and other stakeholders on this and other important issues.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We will also be changing our first round to a 1-1-1 setup for the best-of-three series. We have contemplated both these changes since the pandemic. We would have done it in the current year, but with the Olympic break this year, it wasn't possible. But now that we have charters throughout the season and playoffs, it's feasible. So to summarize, in 2025 we will have a best-of-three first round, five in the semifinals and seven in the WNBA Finals.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"In addition, the 2025 regular season will increase from 40 to 44 games per team. Honestly, the league's growth and increased demand for WNBA basketball made this the ideal time to expand the schedule, lengthen the Finals and provide fans more opportunities to see the best players in the world compete at the highest level.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I also want to take the opportunity to let you know that the WNBA Draft Lottery 2025 presented by State Farm will be broadcast on Sunday, November 17, at 5 p.m. Eastern on ESPN.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, I want to thank you for your coverage this year. It really has made a difference. I really am very grateful to be standing here as the commissioner of a league that has been through so much. To have you all in this room and reporting on this league as you have all year, very grateful for that.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"With that, happy to answer any questions.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, first of all, there's no place in sports for this. Just continue to condemn it, continue to be a voice on this. Also, I think we have been already meeting with some technology providers. I think there are some technology solutions out there that we could deploy and employ. Of course, we want to meet with the players and see what they want to do around that. But there are some technology companies we've been meeting with to see what we can do. It just is something where we have to continue to be a voice for this, a voice against it, condemning it, and making sure that we find every opportunity to support our players, who have been dealing with this for much longer than this year, by the way. I think Sue Bird said that the other day very eloquently. We need to continue to see how we can support the mental health resources, physical security, cybersecurity.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're going to attack it, as I said, multidimensionally. We're going to try to figure out how we can best work with the players as to how they want us to help solve this issue.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, well, next year we do not have any international competition. No FIBA World Cup and no Olympic break, so we should have a nice footprint. It's hard to start much earlier because we obviously have the college season. The college draft is such a great feeder system into the WNBA and creates a lot of excitement, as you've seen over the past few years and probably since the league started.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think probably not starting much earlier. Certainly we're well into October by the time we finish the Finals, especially if we go to five games this year, next year seven. So we'll probably go a little bit later in October.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But again, we'll have a decent footprint next year to fit in the 44. Remember, we have an additional team joining next year, in Golden State Valkyries. So I think it'll be great. We'll have obviously the condensed Commissioner's Cup a few weeks, culminating in that championship, as well.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think next year will be a good footprint. We'll have to look at the following year because that is the FIBA World Cup year. Obviously, we'll be good in 2027, and then it'll be LA '28. It's a constant balancing of the schedule. I think we feel very good about where we'll be next year, for sure, on the footprint.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So that date in November was draft lottery, not the draft. Yes.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The Golden State Valkyries will pick fifth in each round. The lottery picks will be the four teams that you probably have already done the calculations on, but we'll obviously put a release out after this press conference on exactly that, and then the Golden State Valkyries will have the fifth pick in each round.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's a good question on what's next as it relates to our globalization platform. Obviously, we played Toronto, we played in Edmonton. That was kind of our Canada series. Now we'll have a team in Toronto starting in '26. Sure, we'd like to play in more places -- EMEA, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America, I know Mexico City has shown interest, as well as a variety of other cities across the world.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, I was in Paris for the Olympics this year. Thought it was amazing, the support for women's basketball there. I'll never forget on the Friday night when Belgium played France in the women's game. I'd say that was the best crowd that I saw watch a game there. Obviously, a lot of Belgians could drive there to Paris.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It was great to see the growth of the game globally. I think our players represent such great role models to those communities in lifting women. I've admired what the NBA has done with their Global Games platform, playing around the world. I think we'll be on a path there as we get into 2025 and beyond.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That will be something I'm sure in collective bargaining that we'll sit down with the players and Players Association. I think one thing that you noticed in the last year or two, particularly this year, a lot of our veterans were in camp, training camp. Obviously, they have to show up by May 1, and I think it was important. I think you saw the quality of the game in the first few weeks because of that. I also think you saw the quality of the Commissioner's Cup play, which is toward the front half of the season to give that some more relevance. Again, I'm sure it'll be something we continue to discuss and talk about.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so again, we work with FIBA. We're working with all the constituents on how we can make this all work, where they can have vibrant, competitive seasons. We can have our vibrant, competitive season.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, some have moved their dates to end earlier to make sure that those vets -- remember, our prioritization rule does not apply to rookies in their first couple years, but for those vets to come over and play in the best league in the world.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But we have a good relationship with FIBA. Working through with them. And again, I think in 2025 -- that's another impediment to starting earlier, to the question about starting earlier, not only the college draft and college season going into the beginning of April, we need to have a training camp, but also the Euro leagues, as well, play into April now, into May.",,1,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, absolutely. We're always scenario planning around a variety of different outcomes. Certainly, I engage with Nneka and Terri throughout the year, every month, every other week during the season. I really respect the player leadership. I think this is going to be an opportunity to listen to one another and take this league to the next level for generations to come.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We actually look forward to engaging in that now that we've kind of gotten the media deal we discussed, corporate partners, just everything. There's virtually not a sporting event you can turn on where one of our players is not in an ad spot. That was not happening five years ago. Look at Aliyah Boston and Sabrina and A'ja and so many of our players in these ad spots. I think that's a good sign, too, as we think about the future of this game and the future of the agreement between the Players Association and the owners.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, one thing that as a very long-term sports fan I know is that officiating and refereeing is always at the top of the fan's list, of the media's list. Obviously, we work hard on training. We work hard on consistency. Obviously, not every -- they're humans.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Looking at technology, basketball is a little more complex than tennis, for instance, around technology, of officiating. We're looking at a variety of different dimensions, but we'll continue training. We have a lot of veteran officials. You'll see them out here working the Finals. But we always know there's always work to do, always get better. We review in our Competition Committee meetings, officiating and points of emphasis and things like that.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll caucus with Bethany Donaphin, our head of league operations, and our referee operations, as well. We'll caucus to make sure we're putting out the best officiating we can.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So on your first question, we do hear from NBA players who are very interested in investing in WNBA teams. There's a lot of capital inflow coming into women's sports, as many of you are hearing and reading, and obviously we were one of the first and only to raise at the scale we did, 75 million back in 2022. We brought in former NBA players into that capital raise and former WNBA players into that capital raise. So yes, we do get interest from time to time.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Then again, we want to listen to the players as to how they want to think about anything that we go to the bargaining table on, whether that's equity stakes or other issues that they might be interested in. We're certainly willing to listen. I think it is complicated when you have a Players Association versus the league versus the owners who are all small businesses, right. Well, 13, now we'll have 15 to 16, and they're each individual businesses. I think it's a little more complicated because there's no one equity stake. Like Unrivaled, it is one league with equity stake in, and it's not teams. We've got 12, soon to be 16, teams in a league. So it's a little more complicated, I think.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that we look at for all of our teams every year, as well as you mentioned the expansion teams. I think my comments on the expansion teams were you want to make sure the expansion owners know, when you come into the league, it's a competitive league. Free agency is competitive now, and all of our owners are investing. You see investing in practice facilities and other player experiences. I think we want those expansion teams to come in and be the most successful they can.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, you may have a different view, but I think our current owners are all growing in the same direction as far as how they know they need to get free agents to build a championship squad. Obviously great rookies, too, become veterans later on.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I don't have a bias against any one team. Obviously, we have teams playing in different size arenas. You saw some teams upgrade those arenas for certain games this year, and I thought that was a sign and signal that as has attendance had a grown across the league that we can play in bigger arenas. I think when I came into this league, someone said you should all be playing in 5,000-seat arenas. Can you imagine what you're going to see out here tonight if that was in a 5,000-seat arena? No, there's going 17,000-plus people here. And we had our highest-attended game ever, over 20,000, in Washington this year.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I was in Phoenix for the All-Star Game this year taking a tour of their new practice facilities that they opened. Vegas has done it, Seattle has done it, Dallas is going to do it. I think Phoenix I mentioned, and Chicago is looking at upgrading. I think all of our -- we already had some great practice facilities already in the league in Indy, Minnesota, et cetera, and here in New York.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, again, there's no -- we do have standards, but there's nothing where we're saying any one owner is not up to their standards today.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so just in general for the 16th spot, as I've mentioned, the good news is we have a lot of demand from many cities. I'd say 10 or so, maybe even plus at this point, because I think the more people are watching the WNBA and seeing what we're growing here and seeing these players and the product on the court, more people are interested in having it in their cities. They see the economic impact of having a WNBA team in their city, the role model in the community these players represent.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"They were up and their shots weren't falling. We were getting good looks, and it's like, if we are going to be this close, we are not leaving here without this win. It's tough to play in this arena, but the way that we continued to stay together is something that I'm not shocked at but I am really proud of.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Just continuing to kind of be in help side and know that we did some different schemes. We sometimes were sending two to the ball and then leaving somebody open and making sure that, you know, between JJ and I, like we are going to protect the rim at all costs and make sure that nothing is easy, because this is the Finals and everything is going to be tough and we're going to make everybody work for it.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're looking at it from all these angles, partnerships, ranks of our employee base and certainly the coaching diversity and coaching, as well. So it is important to us. There's not a Board of Governors meeting that we don't talk about this. As you know, we've made enormous progress especially in the assistant coaching ranks with former WNBA players by essentially focusing on this over the last couple years. Made enormous progress, which is why our report card is really good.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,20-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Seven, nice. Hopefully we have more time.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,20-Oct,NYARA SABALLY,"Yeah, I mean, it's really just the -- thinking in German, sorry.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA DRAFT,26-Jun,AJ JOHNSON,"No, a hundred percent. I'm super proud of myself just sticking through that Australian season, knowing things were not going my way but continue to believe in myself every single day, and keep taking steps and getting better and looking at the bigger picture of my career. I feel like it's a great experience of being out there.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,17-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. And I think the league is in a great place right now, the amount of high-character guys, the amount of talent throughout the NBA. The fact that LeBron and KD and Steph are still considered one of the best 10 players in the league right now at their age and how long they've been playing is incredible.",1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"I don't know if I felt it. Maybe I did feel it a couple times. I don't know that I felt I had to lift and put Milwaukee on the map. I was just playing hard, doing what I love, being consistent with it, staying humble through the whole journey. I always wanted to get better.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"And obviously like we don't win this game without Stewie. What she was able to do, just continued to chip away. Obviously she'll speak, but I mean, yeah, there's nothing I could say. Like that shot's nice but that doesn't go against what she's been able to do for us tonight and how she was able to just will us back into that game.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we do have standards, by the way, across the board for facilities, practice facilities and things like that. The owners now know that there's an edge to showing a player investment in the things like facilities, et cetera, especially practice facilities.",1,,1,

Just to have them to pick their brains and receive advice that they are giving me, I feel like it's truly a blessing.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I was there for a minute and I got to experience Buckeye Nation and just staying in Ohio, which was amazing. I think just the way we represented that university and the way they're going to continue to, it's an honor to put on that jersey every day, it's an honor to play in front of Buckeye Nation every night. I just hope that we left a legacy of hard work going out there every night and giving it our all.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"""I can't believe I just did this.""

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think that's the way to add these roster spots for purposes of the game, as we've looked at the data. But we continue to monitor that for sure and talk with our players quite frankly about it, as well.",1,,1,

2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,KEVIN DURANT,"Me and Kawhi was in awe of them shooting from the three-point line like it was a free throw. That's strength, power, muscle memory. That's someone who works extremely hard every day on their craft to be able to do that without flinching. It was just normal and natural motion.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,I'd say my post fade. I added it to my game a while back. I've had it in my game. It's a good shot for me. I feel like I should just get to it more.,1,,,1
2024 - ALL-STAR GAME,18-Feb,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"My philosophy is kind of drive them off the three. I think that's what we've been doing the last couple of years. Try to make them shoot a tough two. No layups. Protect the paint. We have a great Defensive Player of the Year candidate, Brook Lopez, on our team. Send as many people as you can to the paint. No easy layups. Whenever a guy is at the three-point line wide open, you've got to fly out to him and make him put the ball on the floor. If he's going to take a dribble, dribble, dribble three, the chance of that going in is better.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,18-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Elite players play no matter the environment, home, road. Elite players play and they love the environment and they are not affected by the environment. That's why you see the series has been what it has, winning on each other's court.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,17-Feb,GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO,"As I said, I don't watch a lot of basketball. I haven't watched him play a lot of the year, but obviously when we are in the bus or in the plane, you have guys going, oh, wow, that's crazy. Then it kind of draws your attention. It's like what happened? You want to know because I'm nosey, I want to know.",1,,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,18-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments.",1,,1,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,ALISSA PILI,"Definitely the community in Salt Lake City. I think it's really grown on me the last two years I was there, and I'm going to miss it a lot because even though I came from another Pac-12 school, they still took me with open arms and just supported me throughout everything.",1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I don't really know him too well, but he seems like a pretty smart guy who understands who he is. He's the number one pick, so they're counting on him to turn around the franchise, and I think he understands that. I think he understands the pressure that comes with it.",1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR MEDIA DAY,17-Feb,JAYSON TATUM,"Would I love to win? Yes. But apparently us losing the Finals two years ago affects what people think of me now, so I guess I've got some ground to make up. Everybody who has a vote, they vote -- the criteria is different. Everybody thinks differently. Right, wrong, or indifferent, it is what it is. You can't tell people what they should look for when they vote. That's the beauty of it.",,1,,1
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,20-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,So I kind of prepared Nyara in that regard and I'm very thankful that it worked well for us.,1,,,1
