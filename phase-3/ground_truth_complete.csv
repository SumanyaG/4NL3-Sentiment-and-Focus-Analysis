2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"It was only a matter of time before we figured out how to make that equate into wins. I'm just thankful to be out here with the group of guys that we've got, trying to win games. We've all bought into the winning mindset and doing what it takes to win. So far, it's been showing.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,I'd say my post fade. I added it to my game a while back. I've had it in my game. It's a good shot for me. I feel like I should just get to it more.,1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I feel like I've done a great job of that so far. Shout-out to our medical staff, too, for helping me in between games, get ready for the next one.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"""I can't believe I just did this."" I mean, getting into the NBA, being drafted, shaking Adam Silver's hand and finally playing in my first game. Obviously, there was a lot of time in between that, but those two moments were huge for me.",1,,,1,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,I wasn't ready for these questions.,,1,1,,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"Laughter. Probably like Embiid or somebody, just because he's huge.",1,,1,,1,,,1,1,,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"Yeah, probably would help with a WWE match.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I'd say we surprised people who weren't paying close attention. Obviously we're in a small market and everything, so we don't have the constant daily national media attention that some teams have around them. But the diehard fans who really watch us could see the talent that we've had for the last couple years.",1,,1,,1,,1,,,1,1,,1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"First of all, it's a blessing to be here. I'm completely grateful. I don't take any of it for granted, especially knowing it can be taken away at any time.",1,,1,,1,,,1,1,,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"What's really respected in this league is winning. It doesn't matter what you do, if you never win at the same time. That's always on the forefront of my mind.",1,,1,,1,,,1,1,,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"With the group of guys we've got, if anybody is not focused on winning, it's kind of an outlier in our locker room. I'm not going to be that guy who is kind of pulling away from what we're trying to do. It's showing in the win column. We know we've got a long ways to go.",1,,1,,1,,1,,,1,1,,1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,It's always good to be able to look back on what we've done so far in the season with kind of a natural break we're having with All-Star break. But there's still been a lot of lessons that we've still got to learn from.,1,,,1,,1,1,,,1,1,,,1,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I don't know, I just always show up early to things, I guess. Part of it's also like I'm young, and I didn't grow up in L.A. When you're driving out there, you've kind of got to take into account there might be two hours of traffic. So just in case, I always leave a lot of room there just in case.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"One of the big things is the balance and the foundation going into your shot. It really helped me work on that. Especially after missing a whole year, I kind of lost kind of the game feel for shooting. I think at Summer League I was 1-for-8 from three. I just stopped shooting them because they just weren't going in.",,1,1,,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"That was a big emphasis this summer, figuring out how to get my shot back to where it had been in the past and even better. That was a big part of it. I got to work on my shot kind of from the ground up, and when I got back to OKC, I kind of just continued that work all the way up to this point.",1,,1,,1,,,1,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"He's a high-level competitor. You can see that in how hard he plays and the emotion that he plays with. He's a really good basketball player, too, so it's always fun to go up against players that are not only really good but play really hard. It really brings the best out of you.",1,,1,,1,,,1,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"Always. Like I just said, it's always great to play against players that are really good and also play hard and have a lot of talent.

2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I'm excited to play against him, but also all the other guys that are in this Rising Stars thing. There's a lot of talent across the board.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I think it's always been an exhibition. If you really go back and watch some of those highlights, there's not a whole lot of defense until the fourth quarter in those ones. But it just comes down to competing. I think last year there was some great moments between, I think Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown where they're going back and forth with each other, just competing.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I mean, it's friendly. At the end of the day, obviously nobody wants to have anything bad happen in terms of injuries or anything during the All-Star Game. But I think it just comes down to competing and having fun with it at the same time.",1,,1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"A lot of guys are friends with each other from being in the league and seeing each other all over the place, growing up playing basketball. If guys have a little friendly competition and go back and forth, I think that would be great for the game.",1,,1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I guess dominance and stats. Yeah, put up a lot of stats.",1,,,1,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,I was on defense? I'd probably say like Embiid.,1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"And then ""welcome to the NBA"" moment, I mean, there's been a lot of good moments and a lot of bad moments this year, just like for anybody in the NBA. But I'd probably say Andre Drummond stripping me and making me fall on the same play. First game in the league, too.",,1,1,,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"First, I feel like I'm coming along great. Physically I've been blessed with enough luck, and I've worked hard enough to play in all 54 games so far this year. Obviously, last year I missed all 82 with kind of, I guess you could say a freak injury. I put a lot of work into my body and making sure that I'm in the right shape and strong enough, et cetera, to kind of deal with the night in, night out banging of the NBA.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"God willing, it would be great to play in all 82 games this year. That's definitely one of my goals this year is to play in every single game.",1,,,1,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,CHET HOLMGREN,"I also understood that's just the beginning. Got a long ways to go from there, a lot of work to put in, but it's a good stepping stone along the way, I guess.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I started off just being an athletic girl, wanting to play hard, run around. Had a high motor. That kind of took me pretty far. I realized that that was something that was going to get me on the court, doing those little things, taking charges.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Then once I got to high school, my coach told me if you can guard multiple positions, you know you're going to play. So I think I carried that with me all the time. As I got into college, I started to watch film. I started to watch my opponents and learn different defensive schemes and all that stuff.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's been a journey, but it's been a great journey.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So being able to purchase tickets to sit front row, seeing that, they were giving out free tickets at one point for girls to come in and just have a crowd. To now playing against Iowa and selling out our crowd at home, just to see that evolution and that aspect, and now I haven't been to that many, but I think I went to one of the playoff games with the Liberty last year.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just to see that in itself, being a young girl, thinking that the stadium was so huge to coming in there going, you've played in stadiums like this but now it's filled up, it's filled to the top, I think it's great to show people that once you invest in women that they can give back in a lot of ways.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Once I learned that these colleges come and you get a free education and you get to experience so many different things -- I've had the opportunity to play on USA teams.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I played with Caitlin when I was at USA for a couple years. So we played together there. But from going against her this year to being able to play with her and also Aliyah Boston, as well, it brings me some comfort, honestly.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, it was definitely a tough decision for me last year, but I told people that I would never trade the decision I made to go to Ohio State.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that mindset and going into Ohio State and coming in and realizing that I can make a little impact, I'm not here to change anything, but I'm just here to sprinkle a little of me in there and try to impact in any way that I can is really helpful.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously adaptability is definitely a big thing, being able to go to a different country, adapt to the environment, adapt to the culture. Overseas is definitely a different way to play ball. They play ball pretty differently there. Just having that prior experience. I know there are a lot of people in the W that are from overseas.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"So just having that prior experience, even playing with the caliber of players that I played with, I think all in all, everything together has helped me become the player I am today. I'm very hopeful and very confident that it will help me in the W.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I think pro level of play would probably be the best one. It's just pretty different. They're used to playing against grown women.

2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's really focused on trying to make the team. Obviously that's the first step going into it, and having confidence in myself and trying to make that. If I do, and when I do get the opportunity to play against them, I think it's just going to be such a surreal feeling. I'm there to compete. I'm there to try to make a roster spot. I'm trying to stay in the league.",1,,1,,1,,,1,,1,,1,1,,,1
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think a lot of it is just excitement, surreal, because I've seen them play. I was younger watching them play. But definitely very competitive and just excitement.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I didn't have the opportunity to really, really get to know her. When I was recruited by Ohio State coming out of high school, she was there. So I got to see her on my visits a couple times. That was probably the biggest interaction. But very hands on, very big about coming to be a Buckeye.",1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,,1,
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CELESTE TAYLOR,"I think it's kind of interesting that that was the school that I was looking at coming out of high school. I ended up finishing my college career there, and now I get to play with a Buckeye. I think that's also going to give me some comfortability. She's a great player and so much I can learn from her.
