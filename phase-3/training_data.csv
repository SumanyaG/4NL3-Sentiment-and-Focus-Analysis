191,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I'll answer the latter first. As many of you know, we already announced that we are providing charter to our players through our full Playoffs, Commissioner's Cup and also the back-to-backs requiring air travel. Why that's important is this year there are a lot more back-to-backs requiring air travel because it's an Olympic year and we have an Olympic break. So we funded out of the league a 4 million fund to fund charter for this year.",1.0,,1.0,
192,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Again, as we build the momentum and build the economic model to fund that longer term, there's nobody that wants that more than I do for these players, but we have to be in the right financial position. We're not going to jeopardize the financial viability of this league. It was just a few years ago we were surviving, and now we're going from survive to thrive.

193,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Media deal. So speaking of better travel, better pay and all that, sports, especially at league levels, you have two main revenue streams. One is your media rights, and the other is corporate partnerships. We've been really making great progress with the corporate partnership side. On the media side, I think women's media rights have been undervalued for so many years, just a microcosm by the way of the broader world that I came from before I came here. So I think it's really important that we're doing everything we can.",1.0,,1.0,
194,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is an important year for us around viewership, around attendance, around all the qualitative and quantitative factors that go into the valuation of media rights, because as I've said to my team, there's not a day that we're not -- if we're not working on things that feed into the valuation of our next media rights, we're not focused on the right things.",,1.0,1.0,
195,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"This is a really important focus for us. Our current deals go through the '25 season. So through October of '25. We do have some time, but we're gearing up for a combination of what that media rights package would look like.",,1.0,1.0,

199,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We continue to engage with cities. I'll throw some of those out there because I've already thrown them out there.

201,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think what's important is there's a reason the WNBA is the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the country, and it's because the NBA has been such a great partner in launching this league, building this league and investing in this league. So to the extent it makes sense, I think what I heard Adam say, but to the extent it made sense to go to market together, that's what we'll do.",1.0,,1.0,
202,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think as you look at streamers who have a subscription model, the WNBA gives the NBA longer programming across the year. I think Adam uses the quote of 320 I actually think it's more days. And there's no other set of two sports leagues that can offer that live programming and sports to a streamer like that. I would say probably in that case we need the NBA because we have a smaller footprint with only 40 games, and it's nice to go to market together.",1.0,,1.0,
203,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So where it makes sense to go together, we will. Where it makes sense -- so we have our own deals today that the NBA doesn't have, with Amazon, with CBS and with ION. So where it makes sense not to, we'll evaluate that and work with Adam and his team on that. We're just excited that we have a lot of interest from a lot of media partners in the W. We've got to deliver an amazing season this year in order to get, I think, the right-sized valuation.",1.0,,1.0,
204,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think everybody is watching those teams that are investing in the player experience. I'll call it more -- because it is more broad than just practice facility. There's a variety of things in player experience that can attract a player in free agency. And quite frankly, off of our 2020 very progressive and historic collective bargaining agreement, free agency opened up, as you've seen, some really interesting years of free agency that we didn't used to have.",1.0,,1.0,
205,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think you see that investment. You'll see it pay off. I think there are other owners looking at the exact same thing. We have situations where, again, we have NBA-affiliated teams who already have great practice facilities.",1.0,,1.0,
206,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think everybody is looking for an advantage to bring in free agents, because the one thing I know these long-term committed owners in the W are, they want to win a championship. I think practice facilities and other player experience have become very important as you seek free agents in the marketplace.",1.0,,1.0,
207,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"See, we're a pretty good vault here at the WNBA. I'm not going to comment on any specific ownership group. We've had several ownership groups in several cities reach out to us. Sometimes in a city, two different ownership groups reach out. Again, we evaluate them through our process. We also evaluate the city, the demographic, the psychographic. That is my hometown, so I happen to know more about that. But we've done a big data exercise in research.",1.0,,1.0,
208,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, the one thing in sports, at the league level we love to bring in these corporate partners because then they can support our players across all of our teams. We've been able to establish that with our current WNBA Changemakers and other partners that aren't Changemakers. We upsell to Changemakers, like we did with CarMax. They were a partner, not a Changemaker, and they came to us and said we want to support the W in a bigger way. So we were able to upsell them, too.",1.0,,1.0,
209,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"There are some open categories we have in a variety of categories. That's how we target who we want to be partners. But we also look at a values match.

210,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, I think with eyes on the game increasing at historic levels, obviously betting is not legal in every state. Integrity is No. 1 for us, so obviously we do a lot in that area. But certainly from a perspective of bringing in a fan base that might not have been in the WNBA before. We've had plenty of betting on WNBA in past years, but obviously I think FanDuel or one of the betting companies released a statistic about that LSU-Iowa game in the Elite Eight, and it was one of the highest bet games they had seen. I hadn't seen the data post that for the Final Four and the final game, but I'm sure a lot of people are paying attention, transcending age, race, gender from that perspective.",1.0,,1.0,
211,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That's what these WNBA players coming into this Draft tonight are going to do for us, and I think the attention and the views and bringing in another part of a fan base that might not have watched women's basketball before and now are following these household names.",1.0,,1.0,
212,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"The one thing I know about sports, you need household names, rivalries and games of consequence.

213,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we need to work on this idea of watch and bet versus bet and watch because if you bet, maybe you don't watch, but if you watch and then bet, yeah, then you're probably bringing in a fan base we haven't had before.",1.0,,1.0,
214,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Integrity first. Obviously, it's not legal in every state in the U.S..

215,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that -- that's why I started to answer this question with the integrity of the game is No. 1. It will remain No. 1 no matter how the handles grow and things like that. But people are going to bet on our sport, and we do a ton of training from the league, the team perspective. The Players Association I know has a rules of the road around this. I think it is really important.",1.0,,1.0,
216,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I was actually talking to the players last night, and I said I learned one thing when I was the CEO of Deloitte about juggling four things in life your work, your health, your family and your integrity. I said, when you juggle those balls, three of those balls are glass and if you drop them, they break, and those are family, health and integrity. The work ball is rubber. You can mess up and recover. But those three balls, so the integrity I think it's really important that the players understand they're big brands with big followership, more than any players have had coming into the league because of the popularity of the women's game at the NCAA level, and how important is integrity.",1.0,,1.0,
217,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's accomplished by training. Do I worry about things like that? Sure, and everybody should in sports. But I do think it's happening around us, and if we're not cognizant of what's going on and how that can benefit the viewership of the league and things like that, so we don't want to leave that on the table, but we want to do it in the right way with the right guardrails around integrity. We have not, to my knowledge, had issues on that, but we'll continue to monitor it for sure.",,1.0,1.0,
218,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously we have a team there, as well, and in other states, but they'll continue to make their impact on this particular issue, maternal health, reproductive rights. Actually, the charities that we'll be donating to as part of the Commissioner's Cup will be charities in that space, and the players, again, will use their voice because they know if they use their voice, change will happen for them.",1.0,,1.0,
219,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think we'll just continue to obviously monitor. You're right, we decide on All-Stars now a year in advance. We're getting better at that. Therefore, we made this decision a year ago.",,1.0,1.0,
220,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so it is great to actually inherit, I'll call it. Quite frankly, again, we didn't do what we did in the bubble in 2020 to have a season, which is existential for us, I'm not sure we're at this moment with these household names coming into our league, because there might have been nowhere to play had we been out of the sports landscape for 20 months. We certainly wouldn't have the momentum we all have in women's basketball and are enjoying.",1.0,,1.0,
221,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So I'm thrilled that we have household names coming in. We need to market around that. In fact, one of the things we did for the first time ever was we did a media ad buy from the Sweet 16 into the final for the WNBA. You might have seen them. I have a prop with me today. Rookie-O's. Arike was in one of the commercials and Stewie was in another, and we had another one predicting when the rookies come in.",1.0,,1.0,
222,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I know just from my circles in life, hearing people who are all talking about the WNBA, that we're going to be successful in that. But it is about marketing, so deployment of that capital in the marketing area. We've increased our marketing budget significantly for this year to capture just that, and I think we're already seeing the returns on that. We had 98 percent positive sentiment on this ad campaign. I mean, that's the W. Ninety-eight percent positive. We're really excited about that.",1.0,,1.0,
223,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We're trying a lot of different things now that we have some of that financial capital and human capital, because you need human capital, too, to grow.

We have a Chief Marketing Officer now and we have the power of the NBA brand, too, helping us market.",1.0,,1.0,

225,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league.",1.0,,1.0,
226,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, we continue to look at the data that comes through and where there's anomalies or unusual -- again, this year is going to be an unusual year overall because of our footprint with an Olympic break, about a three-week Olympic break. But I think next year we'll have a great footprint. We've continued to look at the data around injuries and the hardship system and things like that.",,1.0,1.0,
227,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We also continue to look at where the 10, 11, 12 players on our rosters fall as far as playing time and things like that.",,1.0,1.0,
228,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll continue to take a look at it. I think for now, the roster spots are going to remain at 12. But again, as I said, we're going to add 48 roster spots in probably a three-year period or so, and that's a lot. So we'll give a lot more -- I thought you were going to ask me because my goal is we have -- we need to give these players a lot more opportunities to play at the professional level, and that's what growth is. That's what's going to fund the growth, whether you talk about revenue, media deals, corporate partners, the more cities you're in. Again, longest-tenured league, 330 million people in this country, not enough to be in 12, so now we have 13, on our way to 16, and I think we can do even more after that.",1.0,,1.0,

She always thought there was ways for me to get better. She still thinks that, and I still think that. That's one of the things I just love about her. First of all, she believed I would be here from the day I committed to her, even before that when I was in eighth grade, but also she pushed me really hard to make me as good as I am.",1.0,,,1.0

I got off the plane when we landed in Iowa City, drove directly home, had cook my mom cook me a meal, and then I drove back to Iowa City the next day.

I've seen bits and pieces. It's absolutely amazing. It really allows you to understand the student-athlete for way more than just a basketball player, and I think that's really important.

259,2024 - WNBA DRAFT,15-Apr,CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, honestly, I feel like this was definitely a little bit more emotional for me. I think that's because when you're in the heat of competition, you don't have time to really feel your emotions. You're so competitive and you're so fiery, you're not really worried about all that. I think that was the biggest thing through my career is, first of all, I was able to have a lot of closure in the way my career ended and everything I was able to do. Obviously, I played the maximum number of games I could play my senior year.

384,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,I think Stewie is the same. I don't think making her missing a shot or free throw. We do this long enough that those things happen.

387,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, but I think the opponent has a fair amount to do with it.

390,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"But I don't think either bench has been necessarily a separator. We talked about Hiedeman in the last game. She scored it. I think she had ten, right. So that was impactful.",1.0,,,1.0

394,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, she was digging deep and that's what we needed. We knew we needed to bounce back and it was a big bounce-back game.

395,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. Just like not letting history repeat itself and knowing that Game 1 happened but now, you know, how can we control Game 2 and I think that honestly the thought process was, we were trying to be up a little bit more. Like not letting them get to the three-point line to set up their offense.

403,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"And then in the second half, they made some adjustments and I think it was understanding being able to drive passing lanes and find the open man, if they are going to bring a few on the ball.",1.0,,1.0,
404,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,So I just did that. I don't always need to be looking to score every single time I have the ball. Just continue to make the right read and understanding what it is that provides our best offense as a team.,1.0,,1.0,

407,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But it's great that you put the ball in her hand and be more of a playmaker, because it takes a little bit more pressure off these two in particular.

408,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B and I were continuing to say in the huddles was defensively, you know, the schemes because they went small. So it means our matchups are a little bit different. And making sure that we have each other's help. If we are weak side, who is high, who is low. Just those type of things, and knowing that like scores and stops, we're playing the long game in the last two minutes, and making sure that we are all are on the same page.",1.0,,1.0,
409,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I mean, I think we missed her grittiness and just she's the ultimate competitor.

410,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But you also miss her play-making. That's something we talked about this year.

423,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"It was the difference in this last game. I think that especially after watching the film of Game 1, we slowed down to a pace that is a little bit awkward for us. We want to play fast and we want to move the ball and we want to get downhill and we want to score, obviously.",1.0,,1.0,
424,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"So making sure that no matter what, we continue to play fast, we get good shots and we get that defense moving.",1.0,,1.0,
425,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"Understanding how teams are playing me and being able to make that adjustment in real time. Possession by possession, quarter by quarter, teams have kind of changed the way they have guarded, whether they are switching, hedging, trapping. And I think being able to just be poised and understanding what it is that I need to do in order to create an advantage for the team that we have out there on the floor is what I've always wanted to do, and I feel like I've been able to do that in a really good spot.",1.0,,,1.0
426,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,Obviously my teammates set really good screens and are able to get me open in order for me open to create for them.,1.0,,1.0,
427,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"I'd say it worked pretty well for us, understanding that we use our big lineup and knowing that, you know, we can get the ball inside. We can switch. We're able to apply pressure defensively with our length and being able to get steals and just disrupt their flow.",1.0,,1.0,
428,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"But obviously it's a series and it's a chess match and they are going to throw different adjustments, and I think our ability to stay poised and being able to kind of see what it is that they are doing in real time is going to be crucial.",1.0,,1.0,
429,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,Now we have seen their small ball lineup and we're going to go back and find ways that we can execute while they have that group on the floor.,1.0,,1.0,
430,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we weren't happy the way we played we and we talked about our principles of play. We have it on our wall, there's a way that we want to play when we are at out best, when we are at pace and moving it, setting good screens and getting second and third side when we need it, but with a good inside-outside attack. We came out, and I think that was very effective for us.",1.0,,1.0,
431,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,We always want to try to get the ball to JJ. They bring a lot of congestion and we probably would have liked to put it in more cleaner in some areas but she demands so much attention down there. I thought the are best thing was obviously just getting on the boards. I think she was fantastic for us.,1.0,,,1.0
432,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"And that's what we need. You know, some games you are going to get more touches than other games and shoot but it's more about playing in the right way and sharing the ball and good to great. I think shot selection wasn't great last game. So it's about making those adjustments and continue to play the way that we want to play.",,1.0,1.0,
433,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was thinking no, no, she's up -- no, no, she's going to shoot it. But a three-point shot is a layup for her. We encourage her to shoot all those threes. I know she missed one just before it. But I love the confidence that she brings.",1.0,,,1.0
434,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, you know, I think kind of piggybacking off of the question that I answered from Pepper, it's understanding when I'm getting into the paint, the defense has to make a decision. They are either going to come and take me or they are going to play, you know two on one on the back side, and there's Leo and B in the corner, and as a defender, you just have to take your pick between the two.",1.0,,,1.0
435,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"I was able to just drive in, look her off, and obviously B -- a corner three for B is a layup as well. She shoots that at a really high clip and really well. So I kind of baited Alanna Smith into thinking I was going to pass it high. And B hit a huge shot for us that changed the momentum of the game and continued to extended the lead. I think they called a time-out a little bit after that. It was huge for us.",1.0,,,1.0
436,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SABRINA IONESCU,"We believe in her. She knows that. This was a huge game. She played a huge role in the game ending up the way that it did and she's going to continue to do it for these next two games, we know that.",1.0,,,1.0
437,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I think we've been in these moments before on opposing court when it gets really, really loud, and it's more about making sure we stay true to who we are. We kind of know how we want to play. We know that they are going to make runs. We know the crowd is going to get into it.",1.0,,1.0,
438,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"But we've just got to continue to play -- stay true to who the New York Liberty are, and if we can do that, we can overcome any obstacle.",1.0,,1.0,
439,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We have had great starts in both games, but I thought our -- how much they were talking in the huddle, you know, it wasn't just me talking all the time. They're going ""We have got to rebound. The possession game.""",,1.0,1.0,
440,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,SANDY BRONDELLO,"We kept Minnesota to 27 points in that second half, that's pretty good. And some of our scramble defense, we were down 1-0. So you know, we should be playing like that. And now we can tidy up some things and they can tidy up some things as well, too. We'll look forward to playing another tough game on Wednesday.",1.0,,1.0,
441,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I mean, I think we embrace it. We like it when it's loud. We like it when it's difficult.

442,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,13-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"But just continuing to stick together, and I think also, the biggest thing behind it is like not getting too high or too low, you know. Things are going to seem bigger than what they are because they are playing at home, and I'm sure Minnesota said the same thing when they are playing here.",1.0,,1.0,

We've been in situations where we've been down before, and that's when we really lean on our defense. That's something we were talking about, getting three stops in a row, chipping at it a little bit at a time. Not thinking about the point difference, but thinking about the possession that we need to get a stop and a score. That's just what we were talking about at halftime.",1.0,,1.0,
456,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,NAPHEESA COLLIER,It just goes in preparation. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us and playing tendencies and just playing defense.,1.0,,1.0,

What our narrative was in the timeouts was just we had to find our footing. Find our footing defensively, and we did the second quarter. We held them to 12 after giving up 32. We went into halftime in good shape.",1.0,,1.0,
463,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"No question about it, the second-chance points are really, really disappointing.

464,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,But they played terrific. I thought New York played terrific. Their pace was terrific. They run so many great things.

465,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"And then you look up at the end, and you know, we held them below 40 percent, which is monumental. A lot of that was obviously late. We got big stops when we needed them. Repeatedly, whether ball is going out of bounds or 5050 balls, referees, whatever happens, jump balls, fouls, all that stuff, we just had to be gritty at the end. We had to get stops to win and that's what I'm proud of.",1.0,,1.0,
466,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CHERYL REEVE,"Well said. Alanna is one of our highest WARP players, if you're into analytics. She's one of our highest. You know, like you said, she's not going to wow you. She's not going to fly around, scoring the ball, making post moves. It's not her. But what she does for our team, both offensively and defensively, it's not underappreciated, I can tell you that. It's a little bit understated. People have to really watch to recognize what she does for us. Fighting through. Every night, she's playing against the opposing team's big, and she's not big. And so if you look at the success that she has in doing that, it's the reason why we're sitting here today in the Finals. She's Second Team All-Defense, along with Collier as Defensive Player of the Year. Those two are the heart and soul of our defense.",1.0,,,1.0

The Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, are making their second straight Finals appearance and looking to win their first WNBA championship. Obviously, they won the Commissioner's Cup the other year 2023. The Lynx, one of the most decorated franchises in WNBA history, are looking to win a league-record fifth title and are appearing in a record seventh Finals.

You saw all the statistics we put out viewership, attendance, merch sales, digital engagement at or near record levels. To put it in perspective with a few stats that bring insight into what has happened, the WNBA has significantly outpaced the industry in average consumption of live games in 2024.

Also, I think we have been already meeting with some technology providers. I think there are some technology solutions out there that we could deploy and employ. Of course, we want to meet with the players and see what they want to do around that. But there are some technology companies we've been meeting with to see what we can do. It just is something where we have to continue to be a voice for this, a voice against it, condemning it, and making sure that we find every opportunity to support our players, who have been dealing with this for much longer than this year, by the way.

500,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"It was great to see the growth of the game globally. I think our players represent such great role models to those communities in lifting women. I've admired what the NBA has done with their Global Games platform, playing around the world. I think we'll be on a path there as we get into 2025 and beyond.",1.0,,1.0,
501,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"That will be something I'm sure in collective bargaining that we'll sit down with the players and Players Association. I think one thing that you noticed in the last year or two, particularly this year, a lot of our veterans were in camp, training camp. Obviously, they have to show up by May 1, and I think it was important. I think you saw the quality of the game in the first few weeks because of that. I also think you saw the quality of the Commissioner's Cup play, which is toward the front half of the season to give that some more relevance. Again, I'm sure it'll be something we continue to discuss and talk about.",1.0,,1.0,
502,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so again, we work with FIBA. We're working with all the constituents on how we can make this all work, where they can have vibrant, competitive seasons. We can have our vibrant, competitive season.",1.0,,1.0,
503,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Obviously, some have moved their dates to end earlier to make sure that those vets -- remember, our prioritization rule does not apply to rookies in their first couple years, but for those vets to come over and play in the best league in the world.",1.0,,1.0,
504,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"But we have a good relationship with FIBA. Working through with them. And again, I think in 2025 -- that's another impediment to starting earlier, to the question about starting earlier, not only the college draft and college season going into the beginning of April, we need to have a training camp, but also the Euro leagues, as well, play into April now, into May.",,1.0,1.0,
505,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, absolutely. We're always scenario planning around a variety of different outcomes.

506,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players.",1.0,,1.0,
507,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We actually look forward to engaging in that now that we've kind of gotten the media deal we discussed, corporate partners, just everything. There's virtually not a sporting event you can turn on where one of our players is not in an ad spot. That was not happening five years ago. Look at Aliyah Boston and Sabrina and A'ja and so many of our players in these ad spots. I think that's a good sign, too, as we think about the future of this game and the future of the agreement between the Players Association and the owners.",1.0,,1.0,
508,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, one thing that as a very long-term sports fan I know is that officiating and refereeing is always at the top of the fan's list, of the media's list. Obviously, we work hard on training. We work hard on consistency. Obviously, not every -- they're humans.",1.0,,1.0,
509,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Looking at technology, basketball is a little more complex than tennis, for instance, around technology, of officiating. We're looking at a variety of different dimensions, but we'll continue training. We have a lot of veteran officials. You'll see them out here working the Finals. But we always know there's always work to do, always get better. We review in our Competition Committee meetings, officiating and points of emphasis and things like that.",1.0,,1.0,
510,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"We'll caucus with Bethany Donaphin, our head of league operations, and our referee operations, as well. We'll caucus to make sure we're putting out the best officiating we can.",1.0,,1.0,
511,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"So on your first question, we do hear from NBA players who are very interested in investing in WNBA teams. There's a lot of capital inflow coming into women's sports, as many of you are hearing and reading, and obviously we were one of the first and only to raise at the scale we did, 75 million back in 2022. We brought in former NBA players into that capital raise and former WNBA players into that capital raise. So yes, we do get interest from time to time.",1.0,,1.0,
512,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Then again, we want to listen to the players as to how they want to think about anything that we go to the bargaining table on, whether that's equity stakes or other issues that they might be interested in. We're certainly willing to listen. I think it is complicated when you have a Players Association versus the league versus the owners who are all small businesses, right. Well, 13, now we'll have 15 to 16, and they're each individual businesses. I think it's a little more complicated because there's no one equity stake. Like Unrivaled, it is one league with equity stake in, and it's not teams. We've got 12, soon to be 16, teams in a league. So it's a little more complicated, I think.",1.0,,1.0,
513,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that we look at for all of our teams every year, as well as you mentioned the expansion teams. I think my comments on the expansion teams were you want to make sure the expansion owners know, when you come into the league, it's a competitive league. Free agency is competitive now, and all of our owners are investing. You see investing in practice facilities and other player experiences. I think we want those expansion teams to come in and be the most successful they can.",1.0,,1.0,
514,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, you may have a different view, but I think our current owners are all growing in the same direction as far as how they know they need to get free agents to build a championship squad. Obviously great rookies, too, become veterans later on.",1.0,,1.0,
515,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I don't have a bias against any one team. Obviously, we have teams playing in different size arenas. You saw some teams upgrade those arenas for certain games this year, and I thought that was a sign and signal that as has attendance had a grown across the league that we can play in bigger arenas. I think when I came into this league, someone said you should all be playing in 5,000-seat arenas. Can you imagine what you're going to see out here tonight if that was in a 5,000-seat arena? No, there's going 17,000-plus people here. And we had our highest-attended game ever, over 20,000, in Washington this year.",1.0,,1.0,

517,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"I think, again, there's no -- we do have standards, but there's nothing where we're saying any one owner is not up to their standards today.",1.0,,1.0,
518,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,10-Oct,CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so just in general for the 16th spot, as I've mentioned, the good news is we have a lot of demand from many cities. I'd say 10 or so, maybe even plus at this point, because I think the more people are watching the WNBA and seeing what we're growing here and seeing these players and the product on the court, more people are interested in having it in their cities. They see the economic impact of having a WNBA team in their city, the role model in the community these players represent.",1.0,,1.0,
519,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"They were up and their shots weren't falling. We were getting good looks, and it's like, if we are going to be this close, we are not leaving here without this win.

520,2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,16-Oct,BREANNA STEWART,"Just continuing to kind of be in help side and know that we did some different schemes. We sometimes were sending two to the ball and then leaving somebody open and making sure that, you know, between JJ and I, like we are going to protect the rim at all costs and make sure that nothing is easy, because this is the Finals and everything is going to be tough and we're going to make everybody work for it.",1.0,,1.0,

No easy layups. Whenever a guy is at the three-point line wide open, you've got to fly out to him and make him put the ball on the floor.

So I'd say there's 10 to 12 cities that are very viable that we're evaluating, and we have a process. I'd say I don't have a deadline by which we have to name it because it'll be out to '27 or '28, but I would think in the next couple months or so we'll start -- now as we get into the offseason, we'll start taking a look at those that will go to the top of the list through our process.",1.0,,1.0,

1245,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I think like with Victor, I think I saw like a difference in his stats from playing power forward and center. So like when you're out on the perimeter, like I said, with my size, I don't want to be on the perimeter too much because then you become inefficient or taking bad shots. So you want to stay kind of around the rim, but also you want to be able to use your versatility to keep the defense off balance and make plays from the perimeter.",,1.0,,1.0
1246,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Just finding that for me has been a challenge, just since coming into the league, because I think, when I first came in, I kind of just wanted the ball and wanted to dribble around and see what I can do. Now in year 2, I've been a lot more intentional with how I get to my spots, how I'm being used and where I'm trying to get to on the floor.",1.0,,,1.0
1247,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Even if I do have it as a handler, I'm still trying to get to this spot on the floor. So that's been a big learning curve for me.",1.0,,,1.0
1248,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Definitely the grind of the season with all the travel and the games, and the competition level doesn't drop off. Every game is a high-level game. You're playing against the best players in the world.",1.0,,1.0,
1249,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"So it's definitely grueling when you are playing all these games against the best players in the world. You have to be strong, and not just physically but also mentally. There's a lot on your mind too.",1.0,,,1.0

1252,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"I think that's what we're starting to realize. I think that's why we've been able to put together the last two, three months of basketball that we have.",1.0,,1.0,

1255,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"Considering the circumstances of the injuries and what we went through as a team, I think we were able to fight through it. We started off 5-20. I don't know what our record is since then, but I'm pretty sure it's a winning record. So it just shows how much we came together and bought into what we were trying to do.",1.0,,,1.0
1256,2024 - NBA ALL-STAR RISING STARS PRACTICE,16-Feb,PAOLO BANCHERO,"It's just the guys we have in the locker room. I think we just all get along. We all want to see each other win.
