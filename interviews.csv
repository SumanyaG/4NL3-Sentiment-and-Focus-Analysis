2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I started off just being an athletic girl, wanting to play hard, run around. Had a high motor. That kind of took me pretty far. I realized that that was something that was going to get me on the court, doing those little things, taking charges. Then once I got to high school, my coach told me if you can guard multiple positions, you know you're going to play. So I think I carried that with me all the time. As I got into college, I started to watch film. I started to watch my opponents and learn different defensive schemes and all that stuff. It's been a journey, but it's been a great journey."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I actually am from New York, so I used to go to Liberty games growing up. I was a ball girl a couple times. I've been around the W for a little bit. So being able to purchase tickets to sit front row, seeing that, they were giving out free tickets at one point for girls to come in and just have a crowd. To now playing against Iowa and selling out our crowd at home, just to see that evolution and that aspect, and now I haven't been to that many, but I think I went to one of the playoff games with the Liberty last year. So just to see that in itself, being a young girl, thinking that the stadium was so huge to coming in there going, you've played in stadiums like this but now it's filled up, it's filled to the top, I think it's great to show people that once you invest in women that they can give back in a lot of ways."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't. I did not envision this, not because I didn't think I was capable but because I didn't know. I think honestly until I was in maybe about ninth grade, my freshman year of high school, I had to learn the path that it took to get to the W. I was around it, but I didn't know the path that it took to get there. Once I learned that these colleges come and you get a free education and you get to experience so many different things -- I've had the opportunity to play on USA teams. So just for me, just understanding everything that comes with it. I didn't expect to be here, but I'm here, and I am so excited that Indiana has taken the opportunity on me. I played with Caitlin when I was at USA for a couple years. So we played together there. But from going against her this year to being able to play with her and also Aliyah Boston, as well, it brings me some comfort, honestly. Very excited and so proud of what they've done and how they've grown, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, it was definitely a tough decision for me last year, but I told people that I would never trade the decision I made to go to Ohio State. I think it has brought me so much peace in who I have become as a player and the impact that I can make in any program that I choose or organization that I have the opportunity to be a part of. So just having that mindset and going into Ohio State and coming in and realizing that I can make a little impact, I'm not here to change anything, but I'm just here to sprinkle a little of me in there and try to impact in any way that I can is really helpful. Then yeah, playing with Caitlin now is honestly really cool. We've had the opportunity, like I said, to have that sold-out crowd at our place and then going to her place and having that last regular-season home game for them. Just having the opportunity to play with her again, it's going to be amazing. She's done so much for the women's game, and I know she has so much more to give to everyone. Just a lot of excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously adaptability is definitely a big thing, being able to go to a different country, adapt to the environment, adapt to the culture. Overseas is definitely a different way to play ball. They play ball pretty differently there. Just having that prior experience. I know there are a lot of people in the W that are from overseas. So just having that prior experience, even playing with the caliber of players that I played with, I think all in all, everything together has helped me become the player I am today. I'm very hopeful and very confident that it will help me in the W."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I think pro level of play would probably be the best one. It's just pretty different. They're used to playing against grown women. They're used to that physicality. I think all together it has helped me in many facets of the game of basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"It's really focused on trying to make the team. Obviously that's the first step going into it, and having confidence in myself and trying to make that. If I do, and when I do get the opportunity to play against them, I think it's just going to be such a surreal feeling. I'm there to compete. I'm there to try to make a roster spot. I'm trying to stay in the league. I think a lot of it is just excitement, surreal, because I've seen them play. I was younger watching them play. But definitely very competitive and just excitement."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, obviously very, very big defensive-minded kid, but at the same time, I'm willing to do whatever it is that a team needs me to do. I'm willing to come in there and impact. I'm really big on community. So just getting my hand in the community and continuing to be who I am and continuing to make an impact in every stop that I've had."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CELESTE TAYLOR,"Yeah, I didn't have the opportunity to really, really get to know her. When I was recruited by Ohio State coming out of high school, she was there. So I got to see her on my visits a couple times. That was probably the biggest interaction. But very hands on, very big about coming to be a Buckeye. I think it's kind of interesting that that was the school that I was looking at coming out of high school. I ended up finishing my college career there, and now I get to play with a Buckeye. I think that's also going to give me some comfortability. She's a great player and so much I can learn from her. I'm just ready to go in there to work and continue to learn."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's special. I think taking that fifth year was something I thought long and hard about and I'm glad I did. A lot of good things came from it. Obviously having Emmy next to me it makes everything easier and that much more special. She's had a huge impact on me and everyone at Ohio State, and it's been really cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"She's everything to me. She's my why. She's why I do it, why me and my brother work so hard at it. She's special, and I really hope so. I know it'll be a little harder for them to travel, but I feel like absolutely they'll make it to some games."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, it's a surreal moment because I grew up as a little kid watching all these women play and how talented they are and being able to have a chance to play with them and compete against them, it's a dream. It's what we all are here for, and it's what we're looking forward to. I'm excited. I've seen the growth. Everyone has seen the growth, and to be a part of that is something that is really rare, so I'm looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Absolutely. I think that's something that's really big in today's world, especially with our class. It's exciting just to have those opportunities as women athletes. I think that's something that is kind of new to us, and it's exciting and it's absolutely something people should take advantage of. To be honest, I'm just ready to go play ball down there right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I think there's going to be an adjustment period for all of us, whether people want to admit it or not. I'm looking forward to it and welcoming it. As a rookie I think that's something you have to accept and be ready for. The pace, the length, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of things that are a little different and it'll take some time to get used to, but I'm welcoming that challenge and looking forward to it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I've gotten a lot. I've gotten to spend some time with some vets the past couple days and they've been really helpful. Just staying confident with who you are and what you do well is something that I took from them just a couple days ago. But I think that's important because when you're good at something, you can excel in that area and really keying in on that and taking that with you to the next level is definitely something I'll take from them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"I'm excited to play with everyone, to be honest on that team. Like I said, I grew up watching them, and I think being able to play with them now and getting that opportunity is something that, like I said, was a dream. They're a really talented group, and I know they're going to push me day one when I get there, so I'm excited for that. Competing really against everyone. The league is -- the talent, you guys have seen it and it's no joke and it's something I'm looking forward to and excited for, and like I said, there will be an adjustment, but I'm super excited."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, we've had really good discussions. Coach is awesome and just being able to talk about their system and how they like to do things there was awesome for me to learn, and I'm sure I'll be having more conversations soon, but like I said, they've been really good, and I'm looking forward to talking to them more."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",JACY SHELDON,"Yeah, I was there for a minute and I got to experience Buckeye Nation and just staying in Ohio, which was amazing. I think just the way we represented that university and the way they're going to continue to, it's an honor to put on that jersey every day, it's an honor to play in front of Buckeye Nation every night. I just hope that we left a legacy of hard work going out there every night and giving it our all. As far as representing the university and our fans, I hope we made them proud."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"My conversations were great with T Spoon. As you know, she was coached by Coach Mulkey, so I kind of thought maybe I'll go there. Knowing like the conversations were so good and she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a Black woman and as a head coach, and everything she's done at the NBA level, I just knew everything they were bringing to the table. Jeff [Pagliocca], the GM, was amazing, too, and player development is something that I was looking for and they looked for in me. I'm super excited for this move, and I'm just looking forward to getting to Chicago."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"My first time playing Kamilla was on one of the biggest stages in my life, when she played for Hamilton Heights and I played for St. Frances in high school and we battled. Now being able to be teammates is going to be amazing. I actually talked to her earlier, was congratulating her. I know she came off an amazing run, an amazing college career. I'm looking forward to playing with her in practice and in games, just bouncing off of each other. So I'm excited for this."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Okay, so the quote I live by is ""Every day the sun don't shine but that's why I love tomorrows."" Every day the sun don't shine but I love tomorrow. Every day is not going to be a great day and a lot of times in my life I felt like I was down, but I always looked to the next day because I knew something else was great or something greater was going to happen. That's the quote I live by. I don't know. I don't know what movie right now. I don't know what movie right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Ooh, summertime Chi-town. To be cute on and off the court. I've always been to Chicago. The shopping is great. Just the lifestyle. I'm excited. I feel like I'm a Chi-town girl."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,Something Megan Thee Stallion. I love Megan Thee Stallion. Megan Thee Stallion or Beyoncé.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"I have had so many people reach out to me from so many different places. Understanding our impact isn't just within our school, within just the U.S., but it's worldwide. It's amazing to see. Going out of the country when we go out of the country with my team, with LSU, it was like so much fun because they all recognized us and they knew us and it felt like home. I feel like anywhere we all go, and this draft class is amazing, anywhere we go, we're known. This is super cool because women aren't usually recognized around the world like how we are, and it's not even just basketball. It's the impact we've left on people's lives outside of there. It's super cool to see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"I think our duo, me and Kamilla versus Cam and Rickea is going to be cool to see. That's going to be fun."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Just be you. A lot of people may just tell you that you can't do certain things, and you're going to get more yeses and nos, and I had to realize that. Just being able to be authentic, and people love me because of who I am. I had those tough conversations. I say things that a lot of people are scared to say, and take that scary step. I took a scary step of faith going to LSU, not knowing what could happen, and look how my life has completely changed. Being able to just believe in yourself, trust in yourself and have an amazing team behind me is great."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"I mean, I didn't know what I was going to do. Obviously coming back would have been amazing for me, but I wanted more for myself. I wanted to start over. I feel like I had been at a high since the National Championship, and I want to hit rock bottom. I want to be a rookie again. I want to be knocked down by vets, and I want to be able to get up and grow and be a sponge. I'm just super excited to play with the amazing players and against amazing players. This league is really competitive and I'm a competitive player, so I want to play against a lot of great players."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"Well, my mom was crying before the show even started, so it started there. Then my brother was like agitating me, I bet you $100 that you cry, I bet you $100 that you cry. He kind of got me, too. And I had a great conversation, like she was saying, with Chicago, so I kind of knew -- if it wasn't the Mystics, I knew it was going to be Chicago that was going to be calling me home."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ANGEL REESE,"It means everything. I mean, like I said, on and off the court, we're amazing. We're not just basketball players, we're super impactful to the community, the people around us, the little kids that look up to us, and being able to also be nationwide, everybody knows us everywhere we go. Our lives aren't normal. We might get a little bit of normalcy going into the league now, but I'm just excited to be a trailblazer. I'm excited to be a part of history, and just continue to see the future, and I know it's bright."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, it's huge. Obviously traveling from the other side of the world or from Australia, it's a lot. Like I'm still jet-lagged and everything. I've still got emotions running through and I can barely sleep. But it's great. It's great to just look back, knowing that my country back home, my family and my friends they're all proud of me and they're all supporting me, watching me, especially my mom. She's done so much for me, my family and stuff, making sacrifices for us. Growing up I didn't come from a big basketball sporty world, and just played it because I loved it and my siblings played it, and then to get where I am now, it's incredible."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"Obviously being in Australia, it's a bit difficult to watch the games and get to it and stuff, but I think as the years progressed, we started getting to know the game a bit more and obviously it's like a little sisterhood. We've got the WNBL now on our side and we've got the WNBA, so you get to know about it. And we've got Australians and grads that play in the WNBA, as well, so then you get to study that, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"Yeah, well, growing up in juniors, I'd always be the scorer, attacking the rim, being an offensive player and stuff. But as I headed into the pro league, being young, there's already people doing all that. You have to make sacrifices. You need to learn the game a bit more, learn your other strengths. For me, it was defense. My length, being able to guard different positions, different players, being able to switch on to different people and just using my length, my ability, my quickness to kind of get around people. For me, I think when I play defense and I play great defense, it brings my offense naturally. So it's like, it just comes to me, and I don't have to force anything. So that's probably why I do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm very excited. Obviously playing in a different league and then coming into another one is great. The lifestyle, the people you play against, what we learn in the game here is obviously a bit different, so getting to learn that, playing against people, taking things from them, what I can add into my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"All of them. All the WNBA players. It's so different back home. Again, like in the WBNL we do have imports that come and play, we had Tiffany Mitchell, Jordin Canada and being able to play against them and with them is huge, no matter whether they're guards or bigs, just playing against all of them and seeing the differences in how they all play and just -- yeah."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's amazing. Like I haven't been there before, but stories, everything I've heard about it, we've got fellow Aussies over there, as well. We've got Paul Goriss that's also there, as well, and he's been good to me, as well. He's talked to me then and there. He's been texting me and stuff, and Kristy Wallace. She's amazing, as well, on the court and off the court, as well. But I think just getting to know everyone, getting the experience, the new lifestyle and just -- as well as the coaches and the staff and everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I think it's cool. It's amazing seeing fellow Australians in the WNBA, and they're achieving what you're achieving, as well. It's a privilege, honestly. It's such a great thing, and it's like -- I feel like it's just good that people can look at it and be like, wow, these Australians can play because I feel like that's one thing we don't really get sometimes, and we've had people like Lauren Jackson providing that for us. I hope one day we can leave that kind of legacy to younger kids and everyone, as well, in this generation, as well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",NYADIEW PUOCH,"I'm not really having any expectations. Just going in there with an open mind, making sacrifices. It's going to be hard. I'm young. They're great professional players, talented athletes. It's going to be hard, and I'm coming from a different country, different environment and a new lifestyle. Just taking it day by day, learning experience, talking to the vets, talking to everyone around there and just building that on to my game."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"I think it's great because I could do both, and either spot they need me to play that I could just sharpen in that area and get really good and just excel."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I'm super excited to come in and just learn from players like that. I think that's the fun part about it is we think we've been playing for so long, we know a lot about the game, but there's so much more to learn. I'm just looking forward to that. I think that I just bring versatility and just a physicality to the game of basketball, and so that's what mostly they'll be seeing from me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think just my teammates and how much time we spent together. I think that's something I'll miss, all the memories and things like that. Definitely the community in Salt Lake City. I think it's really grown on me the last two years I was there, and I'm going to miss it a lot because even though I came from another Pac-12 school, they still took me with open arms and just supported me throughout everything. I'm just looking forward to just starting this new journey and hopefully having a great rookie season."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Just that I'm a humble person and somebody who is really for the community and just loves to represent my people. I think I just especially this year just try to tap into representing my culture and just being that inspiration for young kids who look like me and are of my same background. I just think that impact is something that I'll carry with me to the WNBA, and I just hope that's what people see."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I have a little bit. Gianna and Jenna have talked about Minnesota a lot and just how it is a very basketball-oriented state, and there's been so much rich culture of that there. So I'm excited to see it and experience it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, I think they'll just get somebody who's a competitor and somebody who has a unique style of play and is just fun to watch. I'm very excited to just be able to play at the next stage and kind of just improve in areas that I need to to really excel at the next level."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ALISSA PILI,"Yeah, growing up in Alaska was great. I would say I loved my childhood. It was just so much fun, camping, fishing, doing a bunch of outdoor stuff, and it's a beautiful state. The only problem I think was just the isolation it had from the rest of the world, and how much it lacked exposure and just sports and things like that. But I wouldn't have had it any other way. I loved my state and carry that with a lot of pride. I know going to Minnesota the cold probably won't bother me since I'm used to that, but I'm excited to be in a new environment and place. The football question, that's just played a big part in my life, I think, just kind of building up the physicality I played with. It's helped me a lot with that. Just having an older brother, he plays for the Dolphins now, just kind of looking back on it, how we were literally on the same team and competing against each other, it's cool to see. We're both very fortunate to be doing what we love at the highest level, and it's just a blessing."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, first, I'm super excited to be drafted to Phoenix. I know they have some really amazing players there. But yeah, I think I'm super motivated. Obviously since being a kid I've always wanted to play in the WNBA. To have this opportunity means the absolute world to me, and I'm just excited to go out to Phoenix and get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I'll definitely miss the people. I love my teammates, my coaches and the staff around there, and them helping me so much. I know that in the dub I'll be a little bit more independent, so I'll probably miss the extra help of people telling me what to do. But I'm excited for what's next. I know at some point I have to grow up, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think it really was. I think I learned so much about myself as a player and especially as a leader. We had a really young team this past year, and I felt like I was able to grow my game and my leadership. I loved playing with my teammates and they always challenged me to be better, but I definitely think any leadership. I used to be so shy as a kid, so to see where I am now, I'm just so proud of that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I'm so excited to learn from both of them. Obviously they have a lot of great guards there, and Diana Taurasi is like the GOAT of basketball, so to be able to learn from her is going to be so fun and I can't wait for that. Natasha Cloud, I love her energy. I love when she used to play for Mystics and she was so fun to watch. It's kind of unreal to be able to say that like I'm going to be teammates with Diana Taurasi and Natasha Cloud."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"Yeah, I think going in the third round, that's just a number, and I think I'm just going to go out there and do my best and show what I can. I'm really confident in my skills and my abilities. Obviously, I've earned this moment to be here. So I think, like I said, that's just a number, and I'll go out there and try my hardest and make the team."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,All the flavors tonight. All the flavors.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CHARISMA OSBORNE,"I think I was just nervous the entire night, so the feelings didn't really change. I was pretty much nervous. But I know when I heard my name, I was just so excited, and I can't wait to get to work in Phoenix."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I think my emotions have been so up and down over the last six weeks. I had different expectations in February than I did at the end of March. I think I've been dealt with what I've been dealt with, and the only way to really move on is to have a positive outlook. Honestly, I'm so excited for the fit. I'm really excited for Vegas. I think that's really promising. To be able to learn from the people at Vegas for the next year, what more could you ask for? If I'm not able to play on the court, I know that I'll be able to benefit mentally and emotionally just by observing what they have there. I'm really excited, and that's my No. 1 emotion right now."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Well, they're always there for me, first of all, no matter if I go out and have 25 in a game or if I can't play. I know they're going to be at the game. They're going to be the first ones hugging me afterward. That support has meant the world to me over the last 15 years that I've been playing basketball or sports at all. For them to be able to be here with me on draft night, my family, my sister, my parents, it means everything to me. It's not just a testament to what I've been able to do but how they've been able to help me get here."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I didn't start playing basketball super seriously until probably middle of high school, so I wasn't exposed to it super early. But I also think the media didn't push it as much. Even though I played basketball in high school, it wasn't necessarily something that was super popular in the media. But I'm super excited for it to be taking that trajectory. The class that I'm in right now has done an incredible job to bringing attention to women's sports, women's basketball, and now taking it into this league I think is super exciting. I think we're already seeing the impact of that on little girls. I think they're way more aware of it than I was at that age, and that's super exciting. I think with expansion coming up and all that stuff, it's headed toward a really good place. I'm really excited to be a part of it."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, honestly I'm thrilled. I can't think of a better situation to be in with the situation that my leg is in, because it's just an incredible fit. I think their resources are amazing, their facilities are awesome. To be able to look up to the players there, to be able to watch A'ja Wilson, even though I can't play, I know I'll be able to learn so much and get better just by watching and being around the culture that's there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"That means everything. Those five years at Virginia Tech were so, so special. I wouldn't change a thing about it. The people I had around there, the teammates, the coaches, they were just incredible. They made me who I was. For me to bring that attention to Virginia Tech, to take it to a Final Four, win ACC championships, was just so fun. For them to recognize me I think is really, really cool, but it's also just making me really proud of the program that we were able to create there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah, I was just able to talk to Coach Becky Hammon a little bit. Obviously there's a little bit more to be figured out, but she spoke about the medical staff there and just working on getting me out there, so we can see where I am and start taking those steps to get me back on the court again because obviously that's the ultimate goal. But I'm super excited. I think seriously it's a great fit for all of those things. I know that they'll support me, and we'll all have the same goal of getting me healthy and helping to contribute. We'll take it day by day but with that in mind for next year."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",ELIZABETH KITLEY,"Yeah. I mean, he's taught me everything I know. I didn't come into college expected to be anything really. I really didn't take basketball super, super seriously. I thought I wanted to play softball when I was little in college. He completely changed my perspective on that. He made me fall in love with the game to the point where you couldn't get the two of us out of the gym together. We just love spending time with each other in there. I definitely wouldn't be here without him. He completely transformed my game into something that I think is pretty unique and special, and I'm so appreciative for him because of those things. I love him like he's family."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm looking into them pouring into me, and I'm doing the same on and off the court. I'm so excited to play with Cam. We're both competitive. We're young. We're feisty but we're still going to bring that game offensively and defensively. I know if I get beat off the dribble, Cam is swatting into the second row. So I'm ready for that, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I feel like I'm excited to bring my versatility, play at any position, taking advantage of whether it's a small guard on me or bigger or slower player. I'm excited about that. Then I just want to work on getting in tip-top shape after the injury. My conditioning was in the game trying to get back. I feel like when I'm in tip-top shape, world-class shape, that's when I'm playing my best both ends of the floor."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm definitely excited. I'm just grateful that L.A. believed in me. They see something in me, and I see something in them, too. I had great talks with them prior to the draft, so I'm just grateful for it all. Playing at Tennessee and Mississippi State, it's prepared me for this moment because life is just trials and tribulations, but how you get through those, and I feel like I've overcome a lot of adversity. I've continued to stay strong, and that's what got me to where I am today."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, it's crazy to say, but I didn't even think about how the draft process goes. I thought you just show up to draft day and you kind of get drafted. I didn't know if they even speak to you prior to the draft. Really crazy of me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'll answer your second question first. Definitely. This is generational class. I feel like this class is just so different. I know this class is different. I feel like the viewership is peaking. Women's basketball is on an uproar. Everybody is tuning in. We averaged better than the men this year. Not to say we're in competition, but that just says a lot. I'm grateful to be a part of this draft class. I feel like we're just trending in the right direction."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Probably the pace of the game. I feel like high school to college, it was a different pace, so I feel like it's probably going to be that same thing in the league, going up against the world's best players. I feel like that's going to be pretty tough. But I'm excited for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, to be in the conversation with those greats is so crazy and mind blowing to me. I'm just grateful to have Candace come to our games sometimes, have Tamika Catchings, have Jordan Horston in my ear, and they continue to support me. Jordan texted me how much she was proud of me, texted me a little bit about the process. Tamika and I speak every now and then. She's just always pouring into me. I just call her my big sister. Just to have that contact with a Tamika Catchings, it's like, whoa. She doesn't even know it, but when she came to our practice and she was acting like she knew me, you don't even know but I was over here like, girl, you're Tamika Catchings. That was pretty cool to experience, though."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"I would give her advice of just be true to who you are. Problems are going to come, challenges are going to come, but the way that you handle it is what builds character. I feel like there's always a light at the end of the tunnel and just continue to just push, push, push. If she plays basketball, I would say repetition is everything. Get the fundamentals down, just work on the little things before -- this generation is a little more flashy, but the fundamentals are everything."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, growing up I didn't like basketball at all. I just wanted to do girly stuff. I just wanted to be a ballerina and cheerleader. I didn't watch basketball growing up. But once I picked up a ball and I started to see how serious this could go, I really started tuning in a lot. I watched every WNBA basketball game. Even if I can't, I record it and then I'd go back and watch it. I don't look at the score because I like to feel like it's still live. I like that excitement. Just L.A. as a whole, I know they weren't where they wanted to be. Championships, everyone wants a championship. I feel like I'm just excited to be a part of this journey. I feel like we're going to be really good, just looking at the roster itself. I'm just excited. I've watched them play, so I'm kind of familiar of how they like to play, their style of play. So that's pretty cool, and I feel like I'm going to fit in really well."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yes, I'm so excited to play with Zia. It's so full circle. We grew up knowing each other. We played AAU together. We live like an hour away from each other, but that's my best friend, so we're still really close. But I feel like basketball is just always bringing us back together in the craziest ways. We took our four visits together coming out of high school. I'm so excited to play with my girl. I feel like this is just going to reconnect us on that deep level again."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",RICKEA JACKSON,"Yeah, I'm honored, honestly, that she said something like that about Cam and I. I truly believe that, as well. I feel like what Cam and I bring is just foundational, like you said. I feel like we're willing to put in the work. We're willing to do whatever as rookies. So I feel like that's pretty, pretty good, and I'm just excited to get started."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"It played a big role, knowing that we have a few athletes that have already came out of there, and to be one of them means a lot."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"That's a really good question. I think I want to say that no matter what anyone says or anyone may think, and specifically regarding my height, I'm here, and watch me work."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"To know that I'm going to such a special team with quite a few veterans means a lot. It's something like a perfect situation, I'm coming in to learn, and there's a lot to learn from, and like I said, there are a few vets on this squad. So to be able to walk into this situation is kind of perfect for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"The first thing I would say to them is don't allow anyone to dim your light, no matter your size. I've dealt with that all the way up until today, tonight. Other than that, I would say that no matter what happens, if you want to achieve something, you can do that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"I want to learn from the vets as much as possible. I want to add a little bit of everything to my game. I want it to expand. I also want my IQ for the game to expand, as well. Yes, I can score the ball, but what else are you able to do? I think that with those guards over there, they're going to do a wonderful job of helping me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",DYAISHA FAIR,"I'm very excited. I think that it's a full-circle moment for me. I was nominated for that Becky Hammon point guard award, I believe, three seasons in a row when I was at Buffalo. For me to have not received it and to be drafted by her when the time was right has been a full-circle moment, so I'm ready, and I'm ready to go."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Good evening, everyone. It's great to see you all here. Welcome to the 2024 WNBA Draft presented by State Farm. This honestly is one of, I think, my favorite days of the year. We're thrilled to be at the famed Brooklyn Academy of Music for the first time. BAM is actually America's oldest performing arts center, hosting some of the brightest talents across a wide range of concentrations since 1861. Tonight, BAM hosts some of the brightest talents in basketball. You all may have noticed the fans coming in tonight, and I know some of you got held up. We apologize. But this is the first time the draft has had fans in attendance since 2016. Tickets sold out in under 30 minutes, and that was before the players declared for this draft. Just another illustration of the passion and excitement surrounding the WNBA right now. The next chapter in each player's basketball journey starts tonight. I have the ultimate honor of calling their names and seeing the excitement from them, their families, their friends and team representatives as they take the first step of their professional careers. This is just one ""Welcome to the W"" moment for this class. I spent time with them last night and earlier today at the Empire State Building, which will once again brighten up the skyline with WNBA orange tonight. This is a great group of young women. I also spent some time with their parents last night and today and with their families. I'm so excited to see what they will all bring to this league. Speaking of the 2024 draft class, I would be remiss not to mention the incredible excitement and energy for women's basketball that this group has helped build. Just last week, many of those here with us played in front of the largest broadcast audience in history: The national championship peaked at 24 million viewers and was ESPN platforms’ most-viewed college basketball game, men's or women's, on record. Incredible. It's so clear that this draft class is entering the WNBA at an incredible time. We are witnessing a transformational moment in sports that we may not experience for generations. The business transformation -- I know you guys love when I talk about it -- that we've been working so hard at is showing results. Support for the WNBA is continuing to grow. Look at this room. Our sport has never been stronger on the court. I for one feel incredibly blessed to be part of it and to lead the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the United States that is leading the charge for women's sports. This is a league where -- you all know that cover us year-round -- the talent is exceptional, the rivalries are intense and where you tune in to watch a lot of games of consequence. We are ready for this moment. We're coming off a record-breaking season that saw the WNBA reach milestones in viewership, fan engagement, attendance, social media and digital engagement on the WNBA app and website. For the second year in a row, we'll be hosting a preseason game in Canada. This year, the L.A. Sparks and the Seattle Storm will face off at Rogers Place in downtown Edmonton, Alberta, on May 5. We air games in over 200 countries and territories. Games like our Canada game show how the league is continuing to expand its global footprint. The fourth annual Commissioner's Cup will return this time with a new format that we are very excited about. Just remember, this is our fourth annual. Each team will play five Commissioner's Cup games, one against each of its in-conference rivals, all during a two-week period at the beginning of June. The players will compete for a half-million-dollar prize pool, and the league will once again be donating to all of the teams' designated not-for-profit community organizations. This season in July we'll return to Phoenix for the 2024 WNBA All-Star Game, with the three-time WNBA champion Mercury hosting it for the third time. An even bigger and better WNBA Live fan experience will be back for a third straight year. We're excited for you all to see what we have in store at this year's All-Star Game festivities. Each year we are seeing more and more brands eager to partner with us. Our partners have shown that they have stepped up for the WNBA, and we are extremely thankful and fortunate to work with brands that are so excited to be a part of moving the league forward. We were just on stage with the State Farm executives who are here in full force as our presenting partner tonight. Over the past few weeks and months we've announced several partnerships, including with Opill, SKIMS, Peloton, La Crema, Tissot. I've got my Tissot watch on here. We've also renewed partnerships with brands, including Glossier and Amazon, and CBS as media partners. WNBA tip-off 2024 will again be presented by CarMax, which became a WNBA Changemaker, our elite category of our corporate partners, and our others are AT&T, Deloitte, Google, Nike and U.S. Bank. They continue to help us change the game for these players. Our Changemaker partners are a significant driver of our growth, and we are very appreciative of all their support. We look forward to adding more, including another one to be announced as we tip off this season. Our partners are committed to supporting women's sports. We're seeing the work of our broadcast and streaming partners, especially ESPN and ABC. If you build it, they will come. We just proved that in March Madness, and we'll bring that into the WNBA season. We're bringing games to fans where they are, whether they're on national networks, ESPN, ABC, ION, which was our over-the-air partner that we signed last year, streaming on Amazon Prime, ESPN+ or on our own WNBA League Pass, which last year saw milestone growth for the league. And we're hoping to repeat that this year. The growth and demand for the WNBA had led us to expansion, something that I know you all want to hear about. I've been very excited, as you all know. We announced a team in the Bay Area, with the Golden State Warriors coming in the '25 season. So one year from today, they will be here making a pick. With more news to come in the coming weeks and months on other potential markets to join in 2026 and beyond. That brings me to women's basketball is not a fad. We've been steadily building this momentum for years, and we are ready for what's next. Lastly, I have been very reflective over the past couple weeks with all the hype and talk about this draft class and the WNBA. Surviving the existential time of the WNBA wubble, raising that $75 million in capital in February of 2022 as the first women's sports league to do so at that scale, deploying it against our key priorities. Almost as if we knew we had to be ready for this moment, and we are. With that, thank you again for all your support. To those that have covered us over time, we thank you for your coverage. And for those of you that are new, to quote from our ad campaign, welcome to the W. We hope you stay. The WNBA Draft will get started soon, and I'm happy to answer any questions. I really, again, appreciate the coverage. This is what helps grow our sport, and I know many of you have been with us a long time, through our 27th and soon to be 28th season, and we really do appreciate that. With that, we'll start our Q&A portion."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"I'll answer the latter first. As many of you know, we already announced that we are providing charter to our players through our full Playoffs, Commissioner's Cup and also the back-to-backs requiring air travel. Why that's important is this year there are a lot more back-to-backs requiring air travel because it's an Olympic year and we have an Olympic break. So we funded out of the league a $4 million fund to fund charter for this year. Again, as we build the momentum and build the economic model to fund that longer term, there's nobody that wants that more than I do for these players, but we have to be in the right financial position. We're not going to jeopardize the financial viability of this league. It was just a few years ago we were surviving, and now we're going from survive to thrive. So we'll do it at the appropriate time, and we've been chipping away at it every year and adding additional charter flights for the players. Media deal. So speaking of better travel, better pay and all that, sports, especially at league levels, you have two main revenue streams. One is your media rights, and the other is corporate partnerships. We've been really making great progress with the corporate partnership side. On the media side, I think women's media rights have been undervalued for so many years, just a microcosm by the way of the broader world that I came from before I came here. So I think it's really important that we're doing everything we can. This is an important year for us around viewership, around attendance, around all the qualitative and quantitative factors that go into the valuation of media rights, because as I've said to my team, there's not a day that we're not -- if we're not working on things that feed into the valuation of our next media rights, we're not focused on the right things. This is a really important focus for us. Our current deals go through the '25 season. So through October of '25. We do have some time, but we're gearing up for a combination of what that media rights package would look like. As you know, the media landscape continues to be enormously disrupted, with household and people using TV levels down, with obviously cord cutting, with streaming, with over-the-air. Obviously, there's a lot going on subscription-wise, cable. So we're looking at all of that disruption and determining what is the best deals with partners for the WNBA, including, again, traditional linear, streaming and over-the-air."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"So first, our plan and goal is to get to 16 teams in the next few years. We're at 13 with the Golden State team. Our plan is to get three more in the next few years. We're talking to a lot of different cities. I think I've thrown out names before. It's complex because you need arena and practice facility and player housing and all the things, you need committed long-term ownership groups. The nice thing is we're getting a lot of calls. We continue to engage with cities. I'll throw some of those out there because I've already thrown them out there. We continue to engage with cities like Philadelphia and Toronto, and Portland and Denver and Nashville and South Florida and probably forgetting one, but those are the cities we're talking to. But just last week we got calls from two other cities. These can either take a very long time to negotiate or can happen pretty quickly if you find the right ownership group with the right arena situation. We're on our way to 16. That will add 48 roster spots in just a couple of years. That, in a league of 144, is a lot. That's 30 percent. I think it'll be great when we get those done over the next couple years. '26 is definitely our goal for certainly the next one, and then shortly thereafter, if not then, or a year or two after. So by '28, I'd say I'd feel pretty confident we'll be at 16 teams. Expansion draft, again, we're not going to share exact details on the expansion draft today. But it'll happen this year, this calendar year, so probably in December because it has to happen before the college draft. That expansion draft, we'll share more details as we get closer to that. We've been talking with our general managers and head coaches and the teams and the owners, so more to come on that. But there will be an expansion draft this year, and it'll probably be in December."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think what's important is there's a reason the WNBA is the longest-tenured women's professional sports league in the country, and it's because the NBA has been such a great partner in launching this league, building this league and investing in this league. So to the extent it makes sense, I think what I heard Adam say, but to the extent it made sense to go to market together, that's what we'll do. I think as you look at streamers who have a subscription model, the WNBA gives the NBA longer programming across the year. I think Adam uses the quote of 320; I actually think it's more days. And there's no other set of two sports leagues that can offer that live programming and sports to a streamer like that. I would say probably in that case we need the NBA because we have a smaller footprint with only 40 games, and it's nice to go to market together. So where it makes sense to go together, we will. Where it makes sense -- so we have our own deals today that the NBA doesn't have, with Amazon, with CBS and with ION. So where it makes sense not to, we'll evaluate that and work with Adam and his team on that. We're just excited that we have a lot of interest from a lot of media partners in the W. We've got to deliver an amazing season this year in order to get, I think, the right-sized valuation."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think everybody is watching those teams that are investing in the player experience. I'll call it more -- because it is more broad than just practice facility. There's a variety of things in player experience that can attract a player in free agency. And quite frankly, off of our 2020 very progressive and historic collective bargaining agreement, free agency opened up, as you've seen, some really interesting years of free agency that we didn't used to have. I think you see that investment. You'll see it pay off. I think there are other owners looking at the exact same thing. We have situations where, again, we have NBA-affiliated teams who already have great practice facilities. I think everybody is looking for an advantage to bring in free agents, because the one thing I know these long-term committed owners in the W are, they want to win a championship. I think practice facilities and other player experience have become very important as you seek free agents in the marketplace."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"See, we're a pretty good vault here at the WNBA. I'm not going to comment on any specific ownership group. We've had several ownership groups in several cities reach out to us. Sometimes in a city, two different ownership groups reach out. Again, we evaluate them through our process. We also evaluate the city, the demographic, the psychographic. That is my hometown, so I happen to know more about that. But we've done a big data exercise in research. No specific comment on that specific city other than it's certainly on the list. I think it's a great basketball city. We'll continue to discuss it with ownership groups there that are interested in committing long term to the W."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, the one thing in sports, at the league level we love to bring in these corporate partners because then they can support our players across all of our teams. We've been able to establish that with our current WNBA Changemakers and other partners that aren't Changemakers. We upsell to Changemakers, like we did with CarMax. They were a partner, not a Changemaker, and they came to us and said we want to support the W in a bigger way. So we were able to upsell them, too. There are some open categories we have in a variety of categories. That's how we target who we want to be partners. But we also look at a values match. We also look at -- relationships matter, too. If we have relationships with the CEO or the CMO or someone in the C-suite, that's an important part because then you can turn that into a corporate partnership. One of the things that's great about being in the WNBA right now is everybody is paying attention. I ran into someone who ran an ad buy during the final of the women's Final Four. They said -- it was a CEO – they got thousands of messages, not only about how great they thought the ad was but that they ran it during women's basketball, and how much that lifted their brand with not just their female employees but their female customers and everybody."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yes, I think with eyes on the game increasing at historic levels, obviously betting is not legal in every state. Integrity is No. 1 for us, so obviously we do a lot in that area. But certainly from a perspective of bringing in a fan base that might not have been in the WNBA before. We've had plenty of betting on WNBA in past years, but obviously I think FanDuel or one of the betting companies released a statistic about that LSU-Iowa game in the Elite Eight, and it was one of the highest bet games they had seen. I hadn't seen the data post that for the Final Four and the final game, but I'm sure a lot of people are paying attention, transcending age, race, gender from that perspective. That's what these WNBA players coming into this Draft tonight are going to do for us, and I think the attention and the views and bringing in another part of a fan base that might not have watched women's basketball before and now are following these household names. The one thing I know about sports, you need household names, rivalries and games of consequence. Those are the three things we've had over the past couple weeks, and hopefully will continue into the WNBA season. Certainly sports betting is something that attracts fans in. I think we need to work on this idea of watch and bet versus bet and watch because if you bet, maybe you don't watch, but if you watch and then bet, yeah, then you're probably bringing in a fan base we haven't had before. Integrity first. Obviously, it's not legal in every state in the U.S.. But as we start to see that -- and betting partners are supporting our teams, as well, in corporate sponsorships. So I think again, it's an important way to grow our viewership."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that -- that's why I started to answer this question with the integrity of the game is No. 1. It will remain No. 1 no matter how the handles grow and things like that. But people are going to bet on our sport, and we do a ton of training from the league, the team perspective. The Players Association I know has a rules of the road around this. I think it is really important. I was actually talking to the players last night, and I said I learned one thing when I was the CEO of Deloitte about juggling four things in life: your work, your health, your family and your integrity. I said, when you juggle those balls, three of those balls are glass and if you drop them, they break, and those are family, health and integrity. The work ball is rubber. You can mess up and recover. But those three balls, so the integrity I think it's really important that the players understand they're big brands with big followership, more than any players have had coming into the league because of the popularity of the women's game at the NCAA level, and how important is integrity. It's accomplished by training. Do I worry about things like that? Sure, and everybody should in sports. But I do think it's happening around us, and if we're not cognizant of what's going on and how that can benefit the viewership of the league and things like that, so we don't want to leave that on the table, but we want to do it in the right way with the right guardrails around integrity. We have not, to my knowledge, had issues on that, but we'll continue to monitor it for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Right, so obviously one of our focuses this year of our social justice council is reproductive rights, as well as civic engagement, given that we're in a general election year. So the one thing I like about our players, our players want to be engaged. They don't run away from things. They want to be engaged and they want to force change in the communities in which they live and work, and they do it very, very effectively. I think on this issue they'll continue to do that effectively. Obviously we have a team there, as well, and in other states, but they'll continue to make their impact on this particular issue, maternal health, reproductive rights. Actually, the charities that we'll be donating to as part of the Commissioner's Cup will be charities in that space, and the players, again, will use their voice because they know if they use their voice, change will happen for them. I think we'll just continue to obviously monitor. You're right, we decide on All-Stars now a year in advance. We're getting better at that. Therefore, we made this decision a year ago. We'll continue to monitor the situation there, but our players won't run away from it. They'll want to help change and effect change, and we'll use our platform and their platform to do just that."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so it is great to actually inherit, I'll call it. Quite frankly, again, we didn't do what we did in the bubble in 2020 to have a season, which is existential for us, I'm not sure we're at this moment with these household names coming into our league, because there might have been nowhere to play had we been out of the sports landscape for 20 months. We certainly wouldn't have the momentum we all have in women's basketball and are enjoying. So I'm thrilled that we have household names coming in. We need to market around that. In fact, one of the things we did for the first time ever was we did a media ad buy from the Sweet 16 into the final for the WNBA. You might have seen them. I have a prop with me today. Rookie-O's. Arike was in one of the commercials and Stewie was in another, and we had another one predicting when the rookies come in. I thought it was clever, and Arike and Stewie did an amazing job. But this was an investment in bringing that NCAA viewer into the WNBA, and we hadn't done it before. I know just from my circles in life, hearing people who are all talking about the WNBA, that we're going to be successful in that. But it is about marketing, so deployment of that capital in the marketing area. We've increased our marketing budget significantly for this year to capture just that, and I think we're already seeing the returns on that. We had 98 percent positive sentiment on this ad campaign. I mean, that's the W. Ninety-eight percent positive. We're really excited about that. So those are the types of things, but we have a variety of other things. You might have seen some that were at the NBA All-Star Game, how we stood up activations there, and Sabrina-Steph in the three-point competition obviously was a highlight of that weekend. Just continuing to have our player marketing agreement players that we're paying in the offseason to market on behalf of the W. We've got Aliyah Boston here today doing a lot of -- she obviously did an amazing job, I thought, on broadcast during the NCAA Tournament, as well. We're trying a lot of different things now that we have some of that financial capital and human capital, because you need human capital, too, to grow. So we've been able to hire a lot of people in our marketing group, and we had very few when I came in. We have a Chief Marketing Officer now and we have the power of the NBA brand, too, helping us market. It's all shaping up to continue to take these household names and build new household names. I just want to step back and say how blessed I feel to be in women's basketball because it's not just this class, it's next year, the year after. I mean, Juju Watkins and Hannah Hidalgo, Kiki Rice, Paige Bueckers. The list goes on. Someone was out in Portland at the regional at the U-17, and they said, Cathy, you should see these players, U-17 players and how good they are and how good they're going to be. I feel very blessed that we'll have a long run at marketing household names and building rivalries in this league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, we continue to look at the data that comes through and where there's anomalies or unusual -- again, this year is going to be an unusual year overall because of our footprint with an Olympic break, about a three-week Olympic break. But I think next year we'll have a great footprint. We've continued to look at the data around injuries and the hardship system and things like that. We also continue to look at where the 10, 11, 12 players on our rosters fall as far as playing time and things like that. We'll continue to take a look at it. I think for now, the roster spots are going to remain at 12. But again, as I said, we're going to add 48 roster spots in probably a three-year period or so, and that's a lot. So we'll give a lot more -- I thought you were going to ask me because my goal is we have -- we need to give these players a lot more opportunities to play at the professional level, and that's what growth is. That's what's going to fund the growth, whether you talk about revenue, media deals, corporate partners, the more cities you're in. Again, longest-tenured league, 330 million people in this country, not enough to be in 12, so now we have 13, on our way to 16, and I think we can do even more after that. I think that's the way to add these roster spots for purposes of the game, as we've looked at the data. But we continue to monitor that for sure and talk with our players quite frankly about it, as well. Again, I just want to thank you all. Again, for those that are new to this league, watch, rep, buy, attend. It's an amazing game on the court, and I probably wouldn't have taken this job if it wasn't. I really appreciate all your support. Thank you. Enjoy tonight."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"For the first question, the moment, man, it was the moment for me. Right before the Commissioner said my name, I just looked down and thought to myself and said a little prayer, like it's your time, it's God's timing. She said my name, and that's when the water works started happening. Just super grateful for this moment and this opportunity. Your second question with Shakira, great player. Followed her from D-I all the way to the W. I think I'm just happy to really get the opportunity to play alongside her. Such a great player. I think that she's going to elevate me. I can elevate her, too. But whatever impact I can take for this team and to this organization."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Very rewarding, and I think one of the things going into this league that I want to do is just expand my game. Might be asked to play a different role, but I'm open to it. I see myself as a versatile player and impacting in any position that I'm asked to play in. Yeah, it's going to be a tough league, tough first year, but I'm pumped and I'm ready for the challenge."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's been a lot. Long days, a lot of long days. But once I hit the weekend, once I was with my fellow draftees, that's when I started really sinking in the moment and just being appreciative for being a part of this. The W is the W, and it's a great league. I'm just super excited to be a part of it, but the process is no joke, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, just to have a dream like this and to actually walk through it, I said this out there, it's just amazing. A lot of people have dreams, but a lot of people aren't able to achieve it. For me to be fortunate enough to say that and to keep going and to keep pushing my dreams, it's just amazing. I would say my message for the younger girls is just be confident, be who you are, but know your worth. I mean, coming from Canada, wasn't given as many opportunities as, say, my fellow draftees, but I made the best out of it, and I earned everything that I was given. Stay humble but let them know."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"Oh, my gosh, it's great. The Bleed Blue bleeds all the way into the league. I'm just very fortunate to be given the opportunity to go to UConn and spend my four years there, but especially spend my four years there with Nika. We had a hug when my name was called. It's just a lot because the people and the relationships you build over this beautiful game that we play, it's amazing, and to share this moment with her and Coach and CD (Chris Dailey) and J (Jamelle Elliott) and Mo (Morgan Valley), and Paige and Azzi were in the audience, too, it's a family. I'm hoping to make a new family in D.C."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",AALIYAH EDWARDS,"It feels great. I feel like the platform that I was given, even though at first I wasn't really sure that I was able to step into it, but I've had to step into it. I've had to kind of live in my truth because I know that a lot of young girls are looking up to me and a lot of people who are inspired to be like me are watching. You're not only playing for yourself, you're playing for those following behind you, and you're also playing for those who laid the groundwork in front of you. Coming into the W, I respect that. I appreciate, I'm not going to say elders because I don't want them getting on me, but I appreciate our vets, and I'm going to soak up all the experience, but also knowing that I have a huge impact across the border in Canada and across the border in Asia, too."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say what excites me the most is coming into this Liberty team and learning from the vets that are there, and just going in and continuing to grow. I would say something that stood out to me is them looking basically for a two-way player and me being just that. So knowing that I can come in and be a two-way player and make an impact that way is something that I look forward to."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I approach being on a team like that, just coming in each and every day, just getting in the gym and putting in that work to be able to do what those expectations are and just coming in and being ready."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say that makes it a little bit easier. Just coming in and having a certain role and knowing what's expected of you and knowing that you don't have to be the superhero or anything like that. So I would say that that would definitely make it a lot better or -- well, yeah, coming in, learning from those vets."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",MARQUESHA DAVIS,"I would say I'm very excited to work with her and just learn from her and take whatever I can take from her and take it to my game. I would say just being able to score in different ways, that's a way that I can come in and help the Liberty."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is definitely my passing. I think that's at times what gets overlooked in my game. I think the scoring and the long shots is what everybody falls in love with. Then obviously going to an organization that has, in my eyes, one of the best post players in the entire world. My point guard eyes just light up at that. And obviously, Aliyah has been one of my teammates before. I'm excited. I can't wait."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, I don't really feel like I have a rival. I think the biggest thing is the WNBA is so competitive right now. Every single time you step on the floor, it's going to be a rivalry. I think so many teams are loaded with so much talent. This is the most competitive league in the entire world. Less than 144 spots. So you'd better bring it every single night, and I think that's exactly what I'm going to do. But I think that's exactly how I lived my college career, too, is every single game, no matter what the opponent was I prepped the exact same way, I prepared the same way, I brought the same fire, I brought the same energy. I think that's the biggest thing going into my WNBA career."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think the biggest thing is I vividly remember Coach Bluder during my home visit in my recruiting. It was at the end of my junior year, I believe, or maybe the beginning of my junior year. Sometime during my junior year. I think the biggest thing is we talked about this moment, we dreamed of this moment, but she also believed I would be here and she coached me really hard to get to this moment. There was a lot of ups and downs. Something I really appreciated about Coach Bluder is no matter what awards or success or wins we ever had or I had, it's like she never stopped coaching me, she never stopped holding me accountable. She always thought there was ways for me to get better. She still thinks that, and I still think that. That's one of the things I just love about her. First of all, she believed I would be here from the day I committed to her, even before that when I was in eighth grade, but also she pushed me really hard to make me as good as I am."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Definitely Aliyah Boston. Come on now. I think also Erica Wheeler. A vet, somebody that has been in the league a long time, somebody that is in the organization, has been in the league, understands what it's about, somebody that I can lean on. I'm 22 years old, and I don't have all the answers in the world. This is something new to me. This is a new challenge. That's something I'm excited for. But having those type of people around me to lean on and ask questions, or when things get hard, to be there for me. I think those two, for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"I think obviously the course of the last few weeks has been pretty insane in my life, the last two months playing basketball as long as I possibly could in my college career, and then went home for a couple days. I got off the plane when we landed in Iowa City, drove directly home, had cook my mom cook me a meal, and then I drove back to Iowa City the next day. We had our celebration, and then I flew to L.A., flew to New York and now I'm here sitting at this stage. I think the biggest thing is I'm just very lucky to be in this moment, and all these opportunities and these things, they're once in a lifetime. When things might get tiring or you have to do stuff, I think the biggest thing is look at it just as an opportunity. This isn't something everybody gets to do. It's once in a lifetime, and just trying to soak in every single experience because I know how quick of a turnaround it is, and I have a lot of people helping me. Then obviously Aliyah Boston, there's so much you can say about her. Rookie of the Year. In my eyes, one of the best players in the league. Like I said, as a point guard, my biggest job is I'm just feeding Aliyah the ball every single day. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to be in there and be like, go make a layup. She's going to make my life easy. She's incredible. But the thing I love about her is she's a great person. She loves the game, she knows the game, she supports the game and she has a smile that affects a lot of people and brings a lot of joy to people when they watch her. I can't wait to be her teammate again."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Honestly, if I'm being completely honest, I feel like it doesn't change a ton from how I lived my life over the course of the last year. Sponsorships stay the same. The people around me, agents and whatnot, have been able to help me and guide me through the course of the last year. I don't know if I would be in this moment if it wasn't for a lot of them. My mom has done a lot, my dad has done a lot. I think that's just the biggest thing. The advice I would say is just lean on the people around you. I don't have to do every single thing. I think at the same time, in college I always said my main focus is on basketball. That's why I've had every other opportunity in my life is because of the way I carry myself, the way I play the game. Going into my professional career, I plan to do the exact same thing. My focus is solely on basketball, being the best I can. I don't have to do school anymore. That's pretty exciting. I do have to get my degree. I graduate on May 14th. Other than that, my 110 percent focus is on basketball, and when I do that really well and carry myself really well, everything just kind of takes care of itself."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely. I'm actually an executive producer on the show, which has been kind of fun for myself. When Peyton Manning reached out, obviously it's his production company, I was a little skeptical at first, but I was like, I don't know if I really want to let people into my life like that. I've never really done it. But the way this year has unfolded, the way obviously Kamilla and Kiki, the seasons that they had, you can't script it any better. It's been absolutely incredible for women's basketball. If you're a women's basketball fan or you're not a women's basketball fan, I encourage you to watch the show when it comes out. I've seen bits and pieces. It's absolutely amazing. It really allows you to understand the student-athlete for way more than just a basketball player, and I think that's really important. I think that's going to allow fans of the W, fans of college to really understand what they go through, but love them even more for who they are and what they do and what they're about. I'm excited for everybody to see it, and it's been a special project."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Absolutely, and that's definitely our goal is to get back to championship habits. I think it's so cool for me. I vividly remember my freshman year during the bubble, we played Kentucky in the round of 32 and Tamika was calling the game and I was like tweaking out. I couldn't believe she was calling one of my games. Somebody I idolized, somebody that I loved and somebody that is not only a great basketball player and everything that she did but she's a tremendous person. I think that speaks to the organization as a whole, and everything that they do is so first class. I'm very lucky to be going there to an organization that really loves women's basketball. You see it today, I think they had 17,000 tickets claimed to just watch the draft. I think that shows the excitement in Indianapolis. It's a great basketball city. Obviously, what the Pacers have been able to do this year is special, in the Playoffs. I think I'm just excited. Like you said, there's a lot of young talent on the team, and just getting back to the Playoffs and doing everything we can to win a lot of basketball games is certainly the goal."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Yeah, honestly, I feel like this was definitely a little bit more emotional for me. I think that's because when you're in the heat of competition, you don't have time to really feel your emotions. You're so competitive and you're so fiery, you're not really worried about all that. I think that was the biggest thing through my career is, first of all, I was able to have a lot of closure in the way my career ended and everything I was able to do. Obviously, I played the maximum number of games I could play my senior year. Obviously, we didn't win, but you feel like you did everything you can to be in that moment and compete as hard as you can. But when you're kind of just sitting at a table waiting for your name to be called, I think that really allows the emotions to feed you and you're with your family. Obviously, playing a basketball game, I'm not out there with my family. So sharing that moment with them and enjoying it, and people that have really had my back and believed in me more than anyone, is super special."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAITLIN CLARK,"Well, I know the Indiana Hoosiers didn't love me too much during my career, but hopefully we can turn a lot of them into Fever fans, if they're not already. I think going to a state that supports not only basketball but women's basketball, going and playing in front of -- at Indiana, the place is sold out. Doing the same for the Fever is certainly our goal, and having a lot of fans there every single night. For myself, I can't imagine a more perfect fit, a better place for me to start my professional career, an organization that really just believes in women's basketball and wants to do everything the right way. So I couldn't be more excited to get there."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It means the most to me. Just tells me that I'm going to be in good hands, and I'm just excited to get there and get to work with her."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It's been an amazing day. It was my first time over there. Just a nice view. Getting my hair done and my makeup done was also amazing. Getting here, getting drafted was amazing. It's just been a really special moment for me, and everything is going just like I dreamt of."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I would say just getting in the league and bringing my winning leadership, my winning mentality. We won two national championships, so..."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Just getting better, being more physical, more competition. I'm just excited to get out there and play with some of the big names of women's basketball."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that was the dream, but honestly, no, I didn't really expect this. I'm just so proud that I am here right now. I know little Kamilla, when I was 13 years old, is also proud. I'm just excited to be here and happy."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"It's been a crazy couple of days. I'm just so proud of my teammates for winning the national championship. I'm just so happy to be here. I got really emotional because the main goal was to get here and being able to give my family a better life, and just by looking at them and seeing them at my table was amazing. I obviously get emotional when I talk about my family because I'm so proud of everything I was able to accomplish and do for them."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,I think it's going to be great. She's a great player. I'm a great player. So two great players together. Nobody is going to get no rebounds on us.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,This is actually going to be my first time in Chicago. I'm really excited. I've heard really good things about it. You have some of the best pizzas. I'm excited to get there.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I would like to go play overseas somewhere. I think that gets you better. Every time I played for my national team, it got me better somehow. So I'm excited to go to the WNBA and be able to play overseas somewhere."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"Yeah, I feel like that tells you a lot about Coach Staley. She gets you ready for this level. She gets you prepared for whenever you step to the next level, and like I said, that just tells you everything about her. She gets you super prepared for the league."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"I don't know, I'm just excited to get there, get to work, learn from the best and just step up my game. Step my game up."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"My main goal as a WNBA player is just to step my game, being a sponge, soaking in everything from everybody, learn each and every day, and be a better version of myself each and every day. Be open to learning new stuff and stay ready."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,"My conversations with them have been amazing. I'm all about energy. She has a great energy. He has a great energy. I'm just excited to get there and get to work with them. And about specific to me, I'm just excited to meet the whole team."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",KAMILLA CARDOSO,I'm happy. I'm really excited. She's a great player. I'm a great player. I think we're going to do great things together.
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"I love that I get to stay on the West Coast, and I love that they took a chance on me, and I feel like I'm just going to show that I can work really hard and help them a lot. But also, I'll be close to family, which is really important for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"That's a good question. I would say I just want to continue the legacy of growing the sport, and I feel like I've said this a lot today, but we really have to look back at the women before us, and I know people keep saying this is a historic draft class but there were many, many talented draft classes before us. I just want to give my props to the Dawn Staleys, Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslies because they are why I'm here, because I watched them growing up. I just hope that I can continue that legacy for younger girls."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"So growing up, I said this earlier before, as well, but growing up, I was kind of first introduced to the league because my mom was a product line manager at Nike and worked on Dawn Staley's signature shoe and worked with Tamika Catchings and Jen Rizzotti, who I've played 3-on-3 basketball for. Growing up I had so much admiration for these women. It was really upsetting to not see that reciprocated by the public, what you see on social media, and I always do think the negative stands out more than the positive unfortunately, but it was really upsetting for me, and there were a lot of times where I was just kind of dumbfounded by the negativity. But I think now there's a positive switch, and hopefully we can just keep that momentum going."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"Yeah, so I studied communications at Stanford, and my parents both worked for Nike for 20-plus years, grew up in Beaverton. That's where the world headquarters are, so I'm definitely a Nike kid born and raised. But New Balance came to me with -- I see you're wearing New Balances, by the way. I love it. But I'm just so thankful for them because they have signed me as their first female basketball player, and they are just a phenomenal brand through and through, what they stand for, how they support their athletes. I truly cannot be more excited, and I converted for sure."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"Yes, to answer your first question, I think in these situations it's a business now, and you never know. I had great conversations with the Sparks and Raegan Pebley and Curt, and they're amazing, but you just never know, and I didn't want to assume anything. It's just such a high-stress environment, as well, so when they called my name, just a huge wave of emotions hit me. When I saw my mom tearing up and my dad, that definitely hit home. Just was super thankful. Actually, I actually FaceTimed Steph like five minutes before the show started. He just said to just have fun with it. I think he can just share so much great advice because obviously he's been through this, and he just said to make stuff like this fun because it can be stressful. So to make it fun. He answered my mom's FaceTime call. I called Seth Curry, as well. He hung up immediately because that's Seth. But then he called back right after. Yeah, they're both just great sounding boards for me."
2024 - WNBA DRAFT,"April 15, 2024",CAMERON BRINK,"I do, and I played with some great Australians, as well. Agnes Emma-Nnopu is a great friend of mine. Now she's at TCU. But I specifically remember playing against Australia I think U-16 or U-17 it was, and honestly they're some of the strongest people I've ever played against. When they hit you with a screen, it takes you a while to recover. And Lauren Jackson is one of my favorite players ever. I just really admire her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Do you want to ask Cheryl or me? They turned up the pressure. It's the end of the game. Of course we are both trying to win. They turned up the pressure and we got a couple turnovers. We didn't execute our offensive plays at the end, so that's what their defense was doing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I saw a very physical and aggressive New York team. We know this from being a part of the game for so long that sometimes you get away with this stuff when you're physical and aggressive, and they certainly did. It's a shame that officiating had such a hand in a series like this. Obviously there's always going to be a team that's going to be a little more disappointed than the other. I thought today was incredibly disappointing. The challenge -- we have got to change our challenge rules. The officials doing the game should have a third party, because that was not a foul. That call should have been reversed on that challenge. If we sent that clip in -- well, first of all, Napheesa Collier, the number of times she was held, et cetera, there was nothing down on that end. For whatever reason in this series, that's kind of the way it was. At the other end, when we challenged it, if we would have turned that clip in, they would have told us that it was marginal contact, no foul. Guaranteed. Guaranteed. So when you review, those should be the same parameters that you're reviewing with. But the three people on the game need a third party to let them know. Because that decided the game. That decided the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"You watched the whole series, right? What makes her difficult is you're spending a lot of time guarding Sabrina and Stewie. In some of those schemes, it created mismatches. But we were going to live with some of that. We knew that JJ was going to score. These guys shot 30 percent. Shot 30 percent. The difference was in the foul line. Obviously we needed to execute better on offense; I think one of these guys said that. We had opportunities not to fuel them. But we knew they were coming. We just needed -- our lead guard spot was obviously rough for us tonight. We get a little bit decent play out of there, we win the game. But with all that happened, we still almost put ourselves in position to do this. I hurt for our players. I really, really hurt. They are an incredibly special group."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"I think that was kind of the end-of-quarter situation. We were up 12. It was 32-20. We allowed them to come back to get it to within seven or something like that going into the half. That's where we have to be better. That's been throughout the series, too, that end of quarters and things like that. It's hard when you're playing a team at home, a team that knows each other well and things like that. It's hard to just pick one thing, you know what I'm saying, when you still have a chance to win the game. I think, yeah, we could have executed better, but there were so many things that went on throughout the game that we still gave ourselves a chance to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"It's been the same. Game 5, everybody is making their adjustments, mid-game, mid-possession. We are flying around. Everybody knows each other so well at this point. Everybody is trying to make a play and stop them from making a play. They made some plays in the second half."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,We talked about handling their pressure.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Handling the pressure, executing our offense, not turning the ball over to let them get energy in transition and things like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, probably because I was getting held a little bit. It was a little hard to make shots. No, I think, you know, of course, like they said, everyone is trying to make adjustments in the second half. I got a lot of shots up in the first. I was making a lot, so they tightened up their defense, brought people in rotation, were doubling, things like that. They were upping the pressure and it got harder."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I shared with them exactly what you said. Incredibly proud that since the day we got together in training camp all the way through to the end, we were the same team. We never got the disease of ""me."" Not one single player on the team got the disease of ""me,"" not one. Those that were maybe in the rotation, fell out of the rotation, some that never got to play, no one ever put themselves first, no one. That is incredibly difficult to find in this day and age. I'm really, really proud, incredibly proud of the number of people that were impacted by Lynx basketball and how excited they are to watch their team play. I told them, it's who they are as people and how they did it. So those are things we talked about. I wouldn't trade them for anyone. Anyone. Any team. Do things the right way. Built the team within the rules. Those sort of things that maybe right now aren't happening in our league. And did it the hard way. You know what, we gave hope to those teams that aren't willing to circumvent the cap or fly illegally or all the stuff that's happened over the last five years. Do it the right way gives hope for those other teams that you can build a team just like ours. You don't have to have a super team. You don't have to have that. There's a different way to do it. So I'm incredibly proud of them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, it's really rare. Saying that this is my 11th season, and I get to go out to fight with women that I consider sisters, that's why it feels the way it does. Every single day we came to work, we enjoyed being with each other, competing with each other, fighting for each other, and that's why we're here. That's why we gave ourselves a chance to compete for a championship, because we showed up every day and did it the right way and did it for each other. That's really rare in this league. The way that it's happening and all this other bulls--- that people make seem like it's important, it's not."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Obviously the exclamation point to the incredible season that she had. You know, Napheesa showed up big time for this team. Put us in a position to be within seconds of a championship. Phee was phenomenal."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"I'm always so in awe of Phee because she carries it with such grace. She carries it her own way. As a superstar in this league, it can become about something else. But she always keeps it about the team and always keeps it about winning and continuing to get better and better. I'm always in awe of her. Every time she steps on the court and the way she carries herself and no matter what's going on, she's so consistent. That comes from her. That's her internal -- amazing. We just have so much confidence in who she is on and off the court. I'm lucky to be alongside of her. I'm just in awe. She's had an amazing season and amazing postseason obviously. Can't wait to see what she does in the future."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"That's what's coming. I think greater recognition, that's what's coming. Phee has earned every bit of it. Like you said, still, the season she's had, it's not Phee that you're hearing about. It's other players. But I think Phee has earned it. We'll see going into next season if maybe she'll be a little bit more a face of the league."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Well, that's really loaded. It's a lot for me to think about right now, forgive me. I really don't have an answer for that. That's just pretty deep for me. And plus, there's proprietary secrets."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,She was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"No, she was tremendous in the playoffs. Really gave them a lift every single time she got minutes. Not surprised. They went big. It's crazy how the series ended. For four games, it was about the three ball, three ball, three ball. Certainly offensive rebounds throughout the whole thing. But then tonight came down to points in the paint. We don't even score in the paint and we had 44, was it, right. So it was really interesting how the series ended with them playing bigger. They won the game with their defense, no doubt about it, with their defense. Anyway, to your question, her minutes were really good, really helped them. I know all the headlines will be ""Reeve Cries Foul."" Bring it on. Bring it on. Because this s--- was stolen from us. Bring it on."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We talked about it. We know we could have done some things, but you shouldn't have to overcome to that extent. This s--- ain't that hard. Officiating, it's not that hard. When someone is being held, be consistent. If you don't want to call it a hold at one end, don't call it at the other. Be consistent. Every team asks for that. Sandy asked for that last game. Three of the games in this series, we're talking about the same damn thing. So I tell these guys, for whatever reason, it didn't work out. It just doesn't feel right that you lose a series with that level of discrepancy. We don't have a team that whines and complains and all that stuff. Sometimes it probably hurts us. Maybe being a little more, I don't know, something. But you have a star player like Phee, that just, I don't get it. I don't get how she can be held and go to the basket and get hit, and then a marginal, at best, at best, sends their best player to the free throw line. I mean, that's tough. It's tough to swallow. Just like our 2016 championship that was lost -- officiating, missing a shot clock violation. This sucks. This is for a championship for both teams. Let them decide it. What contact is legal should be the same for both teams. This isn't that hard. So it's disappointing. I mean, congratulations to the Liberty on their first championship. Been around, I don't know, how long has the league been around? 28 years? It took them 28 years. Congrats to them. We were that close to our fifth. Just didn't happen. It's disappointing. It's incredibly disappointing. But these guys, I mean, they've got to try to pick themselves up and go, ""We were that damn close."" It hurts. It hurts."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I've been like manifesting this moment for a while. And there's no feeling like it. You know, this game, and credit to Minnesota, because they gave us a tough series. The fans have been amazing everywhere we've gone. But to be able to bring a championship to New York, first ever in franchise history, it's an incredible feeling. I literally can't wait to continue to celebrate with the city because I know it's going to like, be bonkers. Bonkers. Fact, right."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I came in with a game plan of like, it doesn't matter. I want to play defense. I want to rebound. I want to do the little things, and I'll continue to be aggressive and shoot my shots. But if they are not falling, they are not falling. I'm not going to let that affect the way I do things. So continuing to be there for my team. I didn't talk about this, but before I made the free throws, I missed two free throws. I was like, no, I can't do this again, I can't. I have to be here. Olaf (Lange), him and I have talked about being a python, where it's like you know your moment when to strike. At that moment, I was just thinking about being a python."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Good job. You were. Like it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Be a python.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"JJ can come sit up here, JJ. Let's go, MVP."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I thought they were pretty fair (laughter). I mean, the last game, that's where you get give and take. Game No. 1, we should have won that game. I have so much respect for Cheryl, and I have so much respect for that Minnesota Lynx team, because man, that was ugly. But we found a way to win. I'm really proud of our team, how resilient we were, how we stuck together and how we continue to trust each other. That was our word today, just trust the process. We found a way to win. Then going back to Stewie, she did miss two free throws, which is rare for her. But in that five seconds to go, she said, ""I'm going to make 'em."" I'm like, good. I was praying (laughter), but it worked."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'll start here. It's been 10 years, so a decade. I was due one. The last three or four, been runners-up, bridesmaid. It feels good. Now, it's a little bit different, because back then we were so dominant in Phoenix. We got through Minnesota Lynx in the semifinals and then it was 3-0 against Chicago and only the last game was tight when BG was out. This has been a grind every single game. There's things we could have done better, too. But we never strayed away from who we are as a team. I never strayed away from who I am as a coach. I think I just love these ladies here. They are amazing humans. They are fun to coach. But it's the same feeling. That was a great team, a very connected team, and so is this team. That's what I've said in the media a lot, haven't I. I said this feels like the 2014 team that I have coached. I'm just so happy, for everyone, this organization, but particularly these players, that we win today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"I don't know if they are bragging rights. It's for my whole family, basically, specifically Satou. She's been with me every step of the way and has been in my corner through my ups and downs, and I've had a lot of downs in my career. This ring is for her as much as it is for me."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"For me, I'm happy. Just really happy and trying to take in the moment and enjoy every aspect of it. I'm just up here smiling and thanking Jesus and thanking my teammates. Yeah, just enjoying the moment."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"No, I prepared her at halftime. I just felt, going with a bigger lineup, I said, okay, be ready, we may go for a big lineup. So Nyara, you're coming in. I just thought what she brings, she has that X-factor. Her ability to make one-on-one plays, to rebound the ball, to play great defense. I mean, all of it. And then to finish plays. Finish plays. So I prepared her. Really, really proud of her. I know she's had a lot of adversity over here career, but the biggest game of her career, and she really rose to the occasion. For a young player, that says a lot about her. I mean, the future is pretty bright."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Can I say something? Thank you. I think what's incredible about Ny is if you look back at the semifinal series, she didn't really play. Then she stayed ready and knew that in the Finals, her time will come and she continued to stick with it. When we needed her most, because you were the X-factor tonight, Ny. Listen, we were tired. We were trying to do whatever we could. We needed, like a spark and she was that. She continued to trust the process and we are so proud of Ny. So proud."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"When I hugged Stewie, I was sobbing in her ear. I didn't say one word. I was just crying the whole time. I'm so happy to win and do it with her. We talked about it so much, about coming together and what we envisioned of what we wanted to do in New York, and what we could do, to be able to pull it off and accomplish a dream. It's so freaking hard to do. It just means a lot. It means a lot. I told her this before, but I've watched Stewie be great for so long, in high school and then in college and then in the WNBA. For a long time, she was that person that I was kind of like chasing in college; I want my game to be at her level and play against her in the WNBA and to ultimately be teammates. It really just means a lot to be able to win with her and to watch the way that she approaches the game every day. The way that she leads our team, because she is our leader and we look to her in tough moments. So it just really means a lot to have everything come together and to be able to win together."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think that first I had to bring the ball over half court because I didn't want to get an eight-second violation. But then I think it was picture perfect to be able to embrace JJ. Really what I was saying was like, she led us. Her dominance in the paint, on the boards, help-side defense. Everything that we needed, she was there. She had to wait awhile to get to this point, to get to the Finals to win a championship. But the wait was worth it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,Definitely was.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"The wait was so, so, so worth it. We talked about it two years ago when it was free agency, and we wanted to come together. You look back and me, JJ, Sloot, we all came together to win a championship. Last year we lost in the Finals. But look at us, now we're here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"There's no practice tomorrow, so...."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,No practice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was like, let's go. You know, I've won one championship. I've been in many Finals and competed for so long. It's hard to win because this league is so good. You need a little bit of luck on your side, but you also need talent. You also need talent, the right talent to put together. I think Jonathan (Kolb) did a really great job of getting these players to come to New York and sell the vision that we had here. We wanted to win. New York has never won before. Now we are going to go in the history books as the first ever. That makes me very proud. Because it's hard. People think it's easy. Look, I was excited just to coach great talent. I didn't really know them that well. I knew Stewie probably a little bit more than JJ because I coached her wife, Marta, in Phoenix. Hopefully that helped a little bit to get her here. It's a journey. So it's getting to know each other. I think it's been fun. Hey, let's not stop at one, though. Let's go for two."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"I'm not really sure exactly when we flipped the switch. I just remember just like weathering the storm and us really talking about making sure we kept our emotions in check and that we just kept executing and that it was going to be a grind. I think obviously we came out with the win, but I don't really remember an exact moment where the switch was flipped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,How big was Leo's three in the corner? I'm going to tell you this as a fact: Whoever scores first in overtime usually wins. I was confident after that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Am I really the only New Yorker on this team? That is incredible. Honestly, winning in Seattle was amazing and nothing takes away from that. But to be able to bring the first ever to the Liberty and the first in 51 years -- like you guys know, my first WNBA game I ever went to was at MSG, was the Liberty. And to have that be full circle was amazing. Today throughout my whole day, everybody was texting me, like, ""How are you? Are you ready?"" All these things. ""Do your thing."" And I was calm. I was ready because I knew that no matter what, the city was going to have our back. They showed up and they showed out, and they continued to be there for us when we needed. I'm so proud of this team but so happy to be able to bring the first championship here because the city deserves it. Listen, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's going to happen this next week, but I'm sure s--- is going to be crazy."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,Parade in the Bahamas.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Definitely. I think we need to have a parade in the Bahamas. Let's go! Really, really proud of JJ. I love coaching her. I just love her personality, how she brings it every single day. She was big for us. It wasn't a pretty game today. But we were trying to establish her early. At both ends, she worked her butt off. Usually I don't like to play her 42 minutes, but she just stayed competing because that's how important it was. She knew how she needed to help us. She's been big for us. She's been big for us all season long but particularly these playoffs. She's amazing. We love you, JJ. So proud of you, mate. You deserve this. Your first one, baby."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,We want to have an exhibition game in the Bahamas next year.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Parade.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Parade, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"Parade, too. For me, just trying to get the infrastructure of the Bahamas to be a little bit better for sports and especially girls sports in the Bahamas to be a little bit better. I think you need more investment in sports in the Bahamas, to give the kids more games and to allow them to be able to have more developmental camps and different things going on. Just to have more people invested in it. I want to make it my mission to help just grow the game in the Bahamas because we have so much natural talent. So many people that come out of the Bahamas go to the U.S. and go to school, end and up be being really successful. I would like the kids to be able to stay home in the Bahamas and stay with their families and then still be able to come to the U.S. to play professionally. That's the next step we have to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"I'm really proud of my journey. I was talking to Rebecca Lobo earlier after shootaround and just basically telling her, I was doing this thing where we are about to run out after our theme or whatever and they would have the theme music playing. I would look up and be just taking everything in and just really being appreciative of the moment and just having a moment of gratitude without -- with all the chaos that was going on in the Finals, just a moment to just exhale, to breathe and just look around at all the things that we've been able to do, and all the people that are in the gym watching women's sports and the city, like Stewie said, really supporting us. That really helped keep things in perspective. I went out there to play to win and not to lose. The experience that I had, even though it wasn't the best experience and we lost in the past, it allowed me to be a little bit more relaxed in the situation and just understand that these moments aren't guarantees. It's not a given. You have to kind of just take advantage of it but also live in the moment and really appreciate what it took to get here, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"That's a big lineup right there. But I mean, it means a lot, obviously. She did say something at halftime. But I feel like throughout the whole season, it's been unwavering support, whether from Sandy or my teammates and in general, everybody in this organization has always kind of believed in me, which means so much. They drafted me knowing I had to sit out a year. That just shows how much trust they have in me. I feel like this whole season, every time I'm on the floor, my teammates have my back and tell me just to keep going, work hard. It means the world to be able to have players like Stewie and JJ, who I've looked up to my whole career, be my teammates, and now win a championship with them. That's something that I will remember forever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"It's really hard to compare the Olympics to this moment. Especially with Team USA, because at the Olympics, we were going for eight straight gold medals. The pressure is insane, but also the pressure bringing a championship to a city that has never had one, especially in the WNBA, has been a lot. I don't know, this is something that I think I'll be remembering forever, and each Olympics I also remember forever. But the time together is so short. Like, it's three weeks. But like, this is my team. This is my squad. We continue to go to battles together. With the Olympics, you come together for a few days. You have practice and then you go and you play exhibition games against Germany in London, and it's hard to build that chemistry and stuff. But you just know you're Team USA and here now, we're New York Liberty. I don't think I answered your question, but each one is really special, and they are not comparable."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, this one? This is more personal. This is more personal because I'm from New York. I'm from upstate. I came here for a reason, and that's to win a championship."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,Thank you for that (shaking Breanna's hand).
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Yeah, I mean, it's really just the -- thinking in German, sorry."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,You speak German? Go for it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Really it's just the mental preparation of staying ready and being locked in, knowing that whenever you have -- like whatever minutes you get, that's what you get and you need to be ready to go on the floor. Because our team has such a high standard, and really, to be able to live up to that, you have to be mentally ready. Otherwise, you'll just kind of hurt the team in the long run. But with great teammates like that, it's kind of easy to just get on the floor and leave it all out there. Because my role is pretty simple: Run the floor, get rebounds and maybe shoot some buckets. But they make it really easy. They make it really easy for me. It's just like I always said, there's so much talent on the floor, and just being able to bring something to that is just something everybody dreams of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Pepper, we got you. We got you. But it's not tomorrow."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I just went in and told them what I saw and what we needed to do, the adjustments. Obviously I didn't think we were playing with the right amount of urgency. Things were a little too easy for them, and so I just encouraged them. Hey, let's go, 20 more minutes. Then I talked about the big lineup. Be ready for the big lineup. I just thought, I was thinking that all day today, and if things are going hard, we're fatigued. It's been a grueling schedule, five games, and that's a tough team, just the way that they make us work really hard. So I kind of prepared Nyara in that regard and I'm very thankful that it worked well for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,I'll talk for the players.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,"Yes, please."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think what we said was Minnesota, they had 34 points at halftime. Our offense wasn't coming easy, but eventually it was going to come through. Continue to shoot your shots with confidence. But if it's going to be an ugly game, we will win ugly. We've talked about first five minutes, first five minutes, whatever. No. Third quarter. Third quarter is going to be our quarter, especially with the city behind us and the fans behind us. We came out and continued to execute. I think throughout the entire game, we talked about coming together. Huddling, talking about schemes, making sure everybody is calm and confident. And we did that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yes, we did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Whether we were down at half, the score was so low. The WNBA needs to figure out rest days in between all these games, I'm just saying (laughter)."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",NYARA SABALLY,Seven games next year.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 20, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Seven, nice. Hopefully we have more time. Basically we knew we had more in the tank to give and 20 more minutes for the end of the season. I felt like, because I was just thinking about today, and it's like whether we win or lose, we want to put it all on the line. Because last year when we lost, there was more in the tank. And this year, that wasn't happening."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure. All season long, Lan has been in those positions for us. Just appreciate her ability to turn around and buck up and do what her team needed her to do. She's important. Important for her to be on the floor for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I thought it was obvious what we were trying to do. We went four flat and said, Court, make a play. The last thing we said was, we've got to get the last shot. Didn't want to shoot too early. Make sure we get the last shot. We said, BC (Bridget Carleton), if you have a chance, follow it up and see if you can tip one in and get fouled (laughter)."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, for sure. I think as a league, we're kind of getting it, and our TV partner being a partner in the best of ways at this time. All of it. All of the investments. I think the players, the players deserve all the credit for the show that we are being treated to. I thought both teams played well. It was a good game. Obviously both teams, things you can point to -- you wish you made a layup or you wish you didn't do this or that. That's the way a game always is. But no, I'm looking forward to seeing what the ratings are for this one."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"The same defense as always. Try to make it as hard as possible for them to get the shots they want. They are good players. They are going to get shots off. But they can't get easy ones. So that's my goal, to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, same. It's the fourth time we are playing them. We know each other so well and know each other's tendencies. It's just making everything hard. I think that's the name of the game on both sides right now."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I think it's an epitome of the year she's had and how important she's been to the team. Shot making, big three. She's a hustle-play player, so that was on display. Go give yourself a chance to maybe either put it in or get fouled. That's just what she does every day we are around her. She's the same. You can always count on her to be there for you. We're obviously super proud of Bridget."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"Same. I completely agree. I feel like Bridget is just so reliable every time. Like Coach said, we can bank on her to make those hustle plays and to be cool and collected at the end to make those free throws. That's the hardest shot, honestly, in basketball, is to make free throws at the end of the game. To make those at the down at the big moment is who BC is. They were saying Naz Reid free tattoos. I think BC free tattoos is next."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I think you hit the nail on the head. It's unfortunate; those teams were a joy to watch. But it's a sign of the times where we are now. I don't know about these guys, but I know when I'm out and I'm in different places and I'm going to one, everyone is talking about it. Everyone is talking to me about it, talking about, I go to this bar, and this is a bar that maybe wouldn't have a women's game on five years ago. All the TVs have the game on and the volume on, and the place is going crazy. I heard that so many times in different establishments. And obviously I appreciate the opportunity that A Bar of Their Own has given women in making that front and center. I'm happy to support a woman-owned business like that. I just think that what this team has done, obviously the Wolves energized the city in their playoff run, and I'm thrilled to see the same energy came for this team because they deserve it. Obviously the crowd was there tonight, but even more than that, everywhere you go around the city, people are talking about the Lynx."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"It's really tough. I think we are both great players. It was Game 4 and we played each other, what, four times in the regular season. It's going to get harder and harder each time to get the shots that you normally get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",Everyone is out there to do the same thing,"make shots hard. That's my goal every time. She's a great player, one of the best players in the world. But you have to make it as hard as you can for her."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to answer the second part, the Game 5. I don't really think about the other ones. I do feel very blessed in my career to have a chance to have been a part of so many. Haven't won them all. You know, when I was in Detroit, we suffered a heartbreak at home. So it runs the gamut. I think that what I'm just thrilled about is that this group gets to experience the Game 5. It's beyond words how we feel about this team, and we just so wanted them to be in the Finals, No. 1 and two, put themselves in a position to win a championship, and we've done just that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I didn't get a response from the league. I have a text to prove it. I think that -- I think Phee has some things to prove that the fouls weren't called. That's unfortunate. You know, I guess I don't really have much more than that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,Wish I knew. I'd either not eat or not sleep or I'd sleep really good if I knew the difference. It's two great teams. Who knows? Who knows.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"I wanted to come out and enjoy the moment and be as aggressive as possible. When you're playing for your season, after the last game you sit with everything, and you erase it and you want to leave all those internal feelings and put it out there and embrace the crowd. I just wanted to be out there with my teammates and give it everything we had. Shots go in, they don't go in, whatever. There are always things you can fix. But I was just excited to be out there and compete again after the last game. Shots were falling. That's always a good thing."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,We were celebrating together and she was saying how proud she is of us and the team. I was telling her that she has to get her butt to New York.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Anybody that has been following along knows this team, from the beginning of the season all the way through to Game 4, has this unique ability to believe in themselves and believe in each other. What we said before the game, can we do it in the toughest of times, right. Because this will be the most that we are tested. We talked about it in shootaround. This will be the most this group has been tested in that way. I was sure how we would connect and compete. Not sure whether you're going to win the game or not. But I was sure that we were going to be the Minnesota Lynx and how we have done things all season long. You know, the ups and downs and all of that, this group is just equipped to handle it. It's special."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"It was expected. Going into the game, we talked about it in the pregame that we were going into the game as if that didn't happen. Whatever was going to show itself was going to show itself and we were going to react. But we didn't have any minute restrictions and anything else we were doing to modify. Just competed. We did try to get some players off the floor a little bit more. This one (Collier) -- we thought about it. But I think overall I was concerned about leaving Lan too long on the bench, sitting too long. But other than that, we weren't concerned."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, Ceci is tough. You know, goes through a stretch of games where maybe she's not contributing like she wants to contribute, and then all of a sudden we had a Ceci sighting at shootaround the other day and these last two games really helping us. I'm just happy for her. We've always stayed in touch through the years. We've always tried to get her back here. Timing was good for this one, and she's been a great fit for us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,Sounds like he's rooting for them. He didn't text that to me.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,I love it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,Huskies drama.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,Looks like I'm going to have to text him about some things now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Bench was really important. We knew they were going to be. They were ready. They were ready. There was a lot of conversations, the teammates, getting them going and getting them ready to be able to make contributions when they got in the game. Give Dorka credit as she remained patient, and when she got the opportunity, I thought her minutes were good. We'll look at the video. But it was nice to be able to have players able to sub in and stay out there for extended time."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,Is that why we missed layups so we can get down to the nitty-gritty? Is that what she's saying? (Laughter.)
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, yeah, that's what it is. (Laughter.) My heart is still racing. I think we gain energy and confidence from one another. I feel like internally we are strong, strong-minded mentally and physically. We have a lot of belief within our group. We problem solve with each other. It's just a belief, like, internally. I don't know how else to explain it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",NAPHESSA COLLIER,"I think we're excited. I don't even know if I'm thinking about that. I'm thinking that it's a Game 5 of the Finals, that we need to go out and execute. That's really all I'm thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,"Yeah, last 40 minutes of the season. It could be anywhere, really. It doesn't matter. We are going to be out there together going to war, and I'm pumped."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Elite players play no matter the environment, home, road. Elite players play and they love the environment and they are not affected by the environment. That's why you see the series has been what it has, winning on each other's court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm going to say probably information gathered in the three games. Everything is getting harder. So the edge that maybe other games that provided each team, there's no secrets at this point."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I actually was trying to call a timeout, but they didn't hear me. So that's on me. But yeah, you know, it wasn't our best possession. It was loud in here. I don't know, maybe I just have to sprint out in the middle of the court next time. So I've got to be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think that I was going a little bit too fast. I just needed to slow down. They are sending multiple people when I'm slipping on a screen, stuff like that. A little bit better awareness on my part. But quick turnaround and be ready for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"With the two seconds? Yeah, it was like a little screen to get JJ to the block. If not, Sabrina had to come out. So with two seconds, we tried to establish the big girl down low. They defended it well."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, obviously they are great players. I think Stewie said it, we took some shots, we probably could have moved it a little bit more. But look, I will say this, and I look at the thing here and I know Cheryl talked about it last time, but we got no calls today. So do I need to talk up in a press conference? Because they were getting ticky-tacks. And we went down there and got hit and get nothing. It was like 12-6 at halftime and they tried to even it up near the end. It was 14-9. No. All we want is fair, okay. So if we are getting hit, that's a foul. You know, I'm one of the nicest bloody coaches in this league, but this pisses me off. Just be fair. You know, if they are getting hit, it's a bloody foul. But in the end, close game. Things we could have done better. We all could have done better. Including me, getting that (expletive) timeout -- excuse me, don't repeat it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,It's a close-out game. Their backs are against the wall and we are trying to win. It was going to be that type of game tonight where we are both trying to claw and both teams are trying to figure out whatever to do to get over the hump.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, that's what we said we worked for all season long. Minnesota did what they needed to do here to tie it up, and now we go back home. We love playing in front of our home crowd. So it will definitely be another sellout, and it will definitely be loud. And we have to bring our ""A"" game. I have a lot of respect for Minnesota, don't get me wrong. This is a really tough team, really tough team. They play well. They compete. So we've got one more game, and we're going to win on our home court."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Short-term memory. Just the fact that all that happened tonight is the series is even, and there's a Game 5, winner-take-all. We are going back to New York, and we're going to get it done. You know, getting it done there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, of course. We wanted to get it done tonight. But like Sandy said, our fans are like no other, and to be able to go into our environment on Sunday, know they have our backs. So whenever there are tough situations, whenever we're fighting through all of this adversity, we know we have the crowd behind us. That's just going to continue to motivate us. Yeah, can't wait for Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 18, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think that, you know, for our team, we bounce back after a loss really, really well, and making sure that everybody is on the same page going forward. In the playoffs, in a series, there's going to be momentum shifts. There were momentum shifts in the game tonight. But mentally, understanding what's our ultimate goal, how are things going right here. Like Sandy said in the locker room, we haven't won anything yet; we haven't lost anything yet. And we have the opportunity to do that Sunday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"You know, I thought as you said, we had the appropriate effort and focus on what we were doing. As the game wore on, the offense got harder and harder for us. I just think that one of the things, and you know, like I was saying after Game 1, you feel like the ball isn't moving enough, and I think we got easy stuff when we were able to do that. We were taking hard shots. We had good shots. Didn't make shots, right, and that's what it comes down to. Stewie was making shots. JJ's big three when we were up four, that was a big three. Then obviously Ionescu's shot at the end. It's a battle. We talked about that, players making plays. Unfortunately, we didn't make enough of them to put the ball in the hole."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I mean, I'll let these guys talk about that. Go ahead, you guys. Jump in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I feel like they were making plays at the end of shot clocks and like Coach said, we were getting really good looks. We just weren't executing on the offensive end. It's just hard when you get that and then obviously they are a great offensive team and like Coach said in the locker room, it just puts a lot of pressure on our defense. I think we just need to make more shots, honestly."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I don't have an update, game finished what, 15 minutes ago? I haven't talked to the trainer."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",KAYLA McBRIDE,Great player made a good shot. I guarded her for 40 minutes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, obviously give credit to Lan. She did what should he could do. We were plus 20 when she was on the floor. So it obviously hurt. Our starting five is a really good starting five, and you know, not having Lan, foul trouble, and then just not feeling like she could go put us in a bit of a bind. You know, tried different things. You know, just a little bit of a small lineup. See if we could spread the floor and get some easier shots but that didn't produce itself either. We need our starters, just like they need their starters."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I don't necessarily know that it was -- obviously got fouled. She was, you know, asserting herself in that way. The game is called differently for Phee than it is for Stewie for sure. You look at the same level of activity, and around-the-rim contact. For whatever reason, we have a hard time getting to the foul line in this series. I think they were getting some switches that they were picking on. You know, as Lan was switching on her. She made some great plays. She attacked, she made threes, she got it going."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Our defense gave us a chance to win the game. Our defense gave us a chance to win the game, period, and our offense is going to help our defense. If you told me that we would have got the amount of stops that we did and we were playing off that, and we wouldn't have scored 80, that would be surprising to me. This team scored 80, it’s 77-all with the remaining seconds left. I'll have to look at the film. I know when I was watching it live, I liked some of the shots that we were getting. I've seen our players make those shots. You know, it's not to sit here and say, you know, that New York doesn't get credit for, you know, their defense. Just they are a good defensive team. I'll have to watch it but I felt like we got some good opportunities."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure, yeah. We just need to score the ball a couple times. Just a couple times. We were up four. Like I said, that JJ three sort of changed things for them, right. If we get that stop and we just score one or two more times, that's our game. It's a hard-fought game, right. Really great game. That's one that, you know, we convert just a couple and it's our game. So, our defense, and like the things that you mentioned, we did those things. We played well enough at that end. Obviously, it seems crazy to say when Stewie has 30 but you know, she had 38, 39 on us and they only scored 78, 79 points. We were right there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"For sure. For sure. That's what we just talked about. This is Phee's first Finals. So she's feeling these things for the first time. K-Mac has been there. The hardest thing to do, I imagine you guys feel it when you are watching, there's so many ups and downs and swings and all around, and it takes special mental toughness and physical toughness to sort of weather those swings, and here we are. We're disappointed. We're home. We played well and just couldn't come up with the win. It's important that you don't get too high when you win and too low when you lose, and it's really hard. It's really, really hard but we've got to dust ourselves off and get another crack at it here at home with our tremendous fans. And you know, we'll see what we can do on Friday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it feels great. I mean, that's something that -- obviously it's the ultimate goal is to be here and to get a win. Doesn't feel great right now, obviously, with a loss. But I am excited to look at film and see what we can do better. I do think this is our best defense in these two games against New York. So, I'm proud of us for that. But I think just executing more on the offensive end. But it feels amazing. The crowd was awesome. To play at home in the Finals is such a rush. So definitely looking forward to the next game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Her contributions today, she was back to being BC for us. So we were glad to see that, and we'll continue that into game four."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,That was just a great All WNBA Second-Team performance (laughter). That's it.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I mean, I didn't even really remember it. I had to go look at the video really quickly to see like how far I was. But I mean, you know, in the time-out, Sandy kind of was just like, you're going to shoot this shot. You know, I feel like I was able to get a little separation in range and get a really good shot to go. Obviously wanting to let the shot clock wind down. And got the space that I needed to get my feet under me and felt comfortable taking that shot. Sometimes it goes in and sometimes it doesn't. I've practiced that shot a thousand times in my head, on the court, and I feel like that's just something that as athletes, you put yourself in that position to want to be able to make a shot. And obviously like we don't win this game without Stewie. What she was able to do, just continued to chip away. Obviously she'll speak, but I mean, yeah, there's nothing I could say. Like that shot's nice but that doesn't go against what she's been able to do for us tonight and how she was able to just will us back into that game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think that we were all kind of just waiting for our moment. You know, waiting for the script to flip a little bit. You know, they talked about it. They talked about first five minutes, going to come out punching. They punched us in the face in the first quarter and we continued to wear them down. We knew that our pace was something that made them tired and for me, it was just kind of like I was motivated. I was mad. And I liked my matchups that I had, and really kind of attacking them to make sure that we could get this back into where we needed to be for it to be a ballgame."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Just continuing to kind of be in help side and know that we did some different schemes. We sometimes were sending two to the ball and then leaving somebody open and making sure that, you know, between JJ and I, like we are going to protect the rim at all costs and make sure that nothing is easy, because this is the Finals and everything is going to be tough and we're going to make everybody work for it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,That's why I can't be miked up.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I'm not sure exactly what the situation was. Might have been when it was 71-69, because I feel like we were at that score for a long time. But just I could feel it. You know, you could feel the momentum was shifting to our side. They were up and their shots weren't falling. We were getting good looks, and it's like, if we are going to be this close, we are not leaving here without this win. It's tough to play in this arena, but the way that we continued to stay together is something that I'm not shocked at but I am really proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Yeah.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,I was mad we were losing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"We know we're one game away from winning the championship, and I think that they are going to give us their best shot. They are going to give everything they have got, and you know what, so are we. The turnaround is quick but we are going to continue to be ready. There's a lot of things that we didn't do right tonight and have a kind of quick memory. I think that we're happy we got this win but we're -- the job's not done."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I just went up and gave him a big shot. Him and Jodie (Berry), our assistant coach came down and he kind of told me the same thing, like there was never a doubt. Obviously him, Sandy, all the coaches that I've had, just their continued belief and pouring into me means the world to me whether I make or miss that shot. Like the fact that they kind of trusted me to go out there and make big shots, that's why I love playing for this team and continue to pour my all."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"It's pretty special. It was never in doubt. Obviously Stewie got us back in there, willed us in there, but I thought the right time, this is Sabrina. She just made a big shot. She's a great shooter and she just needed a little bit of separation."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Definitely the biggest shot of my career, and yeah, I mean, I would say like I visualize a lot when I'm practicing in the off-season, the night before a game, the day of a game. Like I'm always visualizing different scenarios, and putting myself in tough situations. Like obviously I didn't play my best tonight, but finding a way to continue to stick with it, and I feel like that's been a big growth for me, whether the ball is going in or not. Yeah, definitely the biggest shot of my career and hopefully not the last."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,It did. Pretty nice.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Not for us. I think that, you know, this feels like we're playing on their home court, and I feel like each game is so different. You know, you go from 1 to 2 to 3. But the way that we continue to fight and be resilient. I don't want to speak for you guys. Doesn't feel like Game 1 to me. Feels like Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"At this point, I don't know."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think -- well, I think the way that we fought back in the second, knowing that our offense didn't really click yet but we were able to limit them defensively. But then in the third, when we had a strong push, a strong punch. You guys know the first two games, our third quarters have been a struggle to score offensively. We were getting downhill. We were attacking and we were being confident. If a mistake happened, like a turnover or a missed shot or like something just doesn't go our way, we didn't panic. We continued to play and continued to fight through it because we know how big this moment is. We have the experience of the good, bad, ugly, and different."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, we didn't come out how we wanted to start the game. We knew they'd threw the first punch. I thought we weren't playing how we wanted to play physically, mentally with the pace and everything. But credit to them. They were taking us out of stuff that we wanted to do and they were making big shots. I trust this team. I feel like we've grown so much. We've handled adversity even from Game 1, you know what I mean? It's like, okay, this is a totally different game here and we just had to chip away. But I think in the second half, Stewie just went on a run there. I think we were playing at the right pace. I think our defense was really high level. We were competing. We had heart. It's not about your schemes and all that in these moments. It's about how hard you wanted to compete and we did. Five players were on the same page and every player that stepped on did their job. And just in the time-outs, we were very calm, but it's more like we're not going to lose this game. I did. I felt confident. Even with that last shot I felt confident, okay, because we worked hard and we found a way to win."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think that what the big three means is between Sab, JJ and myself, we know when it's our time to step up and to make an impact. And over the course of the game, it's like sometimes things are hard. Sometimes things are frustrating. I pick up two fouls in the first quarter. But knowing that our team trusts and believes in us to be in this position to take these shots, to help get the game in the right place, but at the same time we wouldn't be here without our teammates, and having that trust and belief just gives us confidence. I don't know. Like, you guys talk about the run, Sab's shot. There was so many players that came in that were like such an important piece of what we were able to do tonight just because they made Minny tired and that's what makes this team really special. It's a collective win even though some of us are shining a little bit brighter."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Thank you.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, I think it's important to just read the game, and being able to get downhill and find JJ on a really important basket that, helped us late in the game. Because you're just not really one-dimensional. The defense doesn't know what you're going to do: Are you going to shoot it; are you going to pass it? Are you going to be a screener, a decoy? There's just so many opportunities that when you have the gravity we have to be able to make it tough on the defense. JJ was huge for us. The way that she protected the rim, hit a huge three, hit that layup, like just continue to go chip away, and it was a total team effort. Like Stewie said, we're not here without every single person on this team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Just in the locker room waiting on Stewie. I would say I really didn't realize how far out I was. Yeah, like I kind of, you know, wasn't sure if I was dribbling with my right or left hand and then I was like, oh, yeah, I did hit that step-back. But I just didn't really realize how far I was, but like I said, it's a shot that I take often and I take in practice and that I take before the game. It's not like a Hail Mary, hope this goes in. It's like, once I got it off, I was like, yeah, this is in."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 16, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I was really, really happy with Nyara. It was the plan to give her a few more extra minutes tonight. Stewie came in a little sooner because Stewie got two fouls early. She played so hard. She was winded by the end of those seven minutes. We played her seven minutes in a row but she was so effective. Just the ability, they were being so aggressive, and what Nyara brings is she's always on her front foot getting downhill. She's always going to run the floor, just a hundred miles an hour, which is what we needed. So it's been great to see her growth, and yeah, it was never in doubt there. But obviously I went to Slooty early, too, and I thought that changed the pace of the game. We struggled a little bit. Not often do I sit both of these at the same time, very rarely. But I felt like we needed to at that moment, and I think they gave us really good energy. We got it back to ten after that first quarter, and I think that was the thing. We've got to keep grinding, keep grinding, and as the game went on, we got back to playing Liberty Basketball."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Our offense was bad at a time when we really needed it. Our pace was slow. Taking too long to get into things, and you know, I don't think we were terribly hard to play against from that standpoint. And that was obviously a difficult time to be doing that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm disappointed that we let it get to 17. I'm more disappointed in that. I'm more than disappointed, I'm pissed that that happened again."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Sure, did."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,It's hard. You have to adjust to the refs. Definitely it's not an excuse. We played really bad. I'm definitely not using that as an excuse. But it's hard to adjust because you are playing one way and you are getting used to the refs and then they change it up. But that's not why we lost. It wasn't them. It was us. Can't blame that.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"It's been talked about a lot. This is a group that problem solves well together. They never think they are out of it. Their belief in themselves and their belief in each other is top-notch. And we know it's a long game. They are very experienced. We just knew what we had to clean up, get some things cleaned up and we did that then. Put ourselves in position, right where we wanted to be and just couldn't get over the hump."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I don't think it affected the game. I don't know if it affected her play. Phee can answer that. It was a chance to get her three minutes of rest and at the end of the quarter, that was fine, and then she went back in. So it didn't affect us."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Huge difference. So both games they have gotten help from part of their -- they have a big five, right, their starters are all very capable, just like our starters are all very capable and you need players beyond your stars, and for two games, they have done that. We're having trouble getting that consistently and we've got to have that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I mean, yeah, obviously you want to steal one on the road. We're really disappointed I think in how we played today but excited to go home and play in front of our crowd, and we have to respond. We have to come out playing better than we did in these two games. It's hard. Like we are both competing for a championship. You have to play with a level of desperation from the very beginning, and so that's what we're going to need to do to come out in Game 3."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,I honestly don't feel like I changed my mindset. I feel like I stayed aggressive on defense. I was frustrated that I had those four fouls but I don't think it affected me in the way that I was playing.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"No, I happen to agree with you. I had a chance to talk to Joe Ingles, I don't know if I told Lan this when we were in Minnesota, and he asked me how I liked my Australian. And we talked about all the ways that we love the way that Lan plays and her level of compete, and that's what Joe said. He's like, one thing you're darned sure an Australian is going to do is compete their tails off. And Lan is the very definition of that. Doesn't matter how big, doesn't matter how difficult it is. Lan is always there for us in that way."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We were trying to get another ball handler out there, somebody they had to pay attention to, try to get downhill a little bit, try to create some easier opportunities playing with flow. Setups weren't necessarily producing anything for us, so we just thought, spread the floor and play with two ball handlers."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Well, I mean, what did she have at half, 12? Ten of them were in fast break. Ten of them were fast break. So what changed is she wasn't able to get it in the fast break and we had her in the halfcourt."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I think Stewie is the same. I don't think making her missing a shot or free throw. We do this long enough that those things happen. She's resilient. She played exactly like we thought she would. I thought she played great in Game 1. And so you know, I think her impact defensively was something that we felt. You know, what did she have, seven steals? And so you know, she's been doing that in these playoffs. More than that, in my mind -- you have to ask Stewie, but I don't think that's what was on her mind. I think what was on their collective minds is it's a must-win game for them and they came out and played like it was, and they took the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Yeah, but I think the opponent has a fair amount to do with it. We have to come up with better opportunities and better things that we can do offensively so that we can get back to a little bit more of a balanced scoring. So I think that's most important to say is New York has had a lot to do with this."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"You've got players that are playing a lot of minutes, a lot of heavy minutes, and any time you can get your bench to come in and be productive and you can keep them out there longer, that's an advantage. But I don't think either bench has been necessarily a separator. We talked about Hiedeman in the last game. She scored it. I think she had ten, right. So that was impactful. But you know, both teams are looking for anywhere else you can go so that you don't have all this pressure on your top players."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"What we continued to keep saying to one another was like stay together, keep playing. Every rebound matters. And even if our offense gets a little bit stagnant and funky, we are not going to let that dictate what we do defensively."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, massive. They have been going under on screens so we encouraged her to shoot the three. She's a great three-point shooter. She was stroking it yesterday in practice before the game. Yeah, she was digging deep and that's what we needed. We knew we needed to bounce back and it was a big bounce-back game. They contained Leonie a little bit after what she did in Game 1 but B helped us get this margin to win the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. Just like not letting history repeat itself and knowing that Game 1 happened but now, you know, how can we control Game 2 and I think that honestly the thought process was, we were trying to be up a little bit more. Like not letting them get to the three-point line to set up their offense. And then in to out, whether I'm helping, I know that Sab or whoever else is helping on my backside, and making them have to move just a little bit quicker than they want to."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"No. Honestly -- sorry, I'll just rant (laughter). I kind of texted him and I was like, you know what it's about time that you come to my game. I've been here for two years and he hasn't come down. What are you doing? Yeah, CD (Dailey) came and she got that same message, too."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,It's a long drive.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Two hours.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B brings is this grit, this toughness, knowing that -- and all of us know, she's giving us whatever she's got, and the way that she continued to be aggressive, they were going under on her and she knocked that thing down with confidence, got into the paint, drive and kicks. But that's what we're used to. We know she can do this and happy to see her get into a good rhythm with everything that's been up and down this season and know that she's a big factor in everything we do."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think that the first thing was higher pick-up points, knowing that if Leo was going to be up, really trying to limit Courtney Williams, then I need to be there, too. So when Phee is dribbling up it's without any pressure. Obviously knowing her tendencies. She wants to go left, she wants to go over the right shoulder. She's going to pump fake a million times. So just staying down and making her continue to take tough shot that she doesn't want to take."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"That's really what my goal was, was just take what the defense gives me and not forcing anything but understanding I'm going to be able to drive and kick. And players hit, multiple players hit really big shots. But obviously I think coming out like that was great for us to get going. And then in the second half, they made some adjustments and I think it was understanding being able to drive passing lanes and find the open man, if they are going to bring a few on the ball. So I just did that. I don't always need to be looking to score every single time I have the ball. Just continue to make the right read and understanding what it is that provides our best offense as a team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I think everyone has seen her. She's been struggling but she's been feeling good these last few days, can tell you that much. She has been. We just knew it was a bit of time. We've given her so much rest here and she was ready to go. She puts the work in. Like I said, she's tough. We talked about the grittiness that she gives us. But it's great that you put the ball in her hand and be more of a playmaker, because it takes a little bit more pressure off these two in particular. I thought that was very effective for us. But her defense, she was everywhere. She was guarding everyone. I'm really happy for her. We just have to freshen up and get ready for the next game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think what B and I were continuing to say in the huddles was defensively, you know, the schemes because they went small. So it means our matchups are a little bit different. And making sure that we have each other's help. If we are weak side, who is high, who is low. Just those type of things, and knowing that like scores and stops, we're playing the long game in the last two minutes, and making sure that we are all are on the same page."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I mean, I think we missed her grittiness and just she's the ultimate competitor. She takes pride -- she used to always guard the best player and obviously now we have Leo, too, that makes us really a versatile defensive team. But you also miss her play-making. That's something we talked about this year. We wanted to make sure she could play-make more and it was hard for to play-make when she was hobbling around with the knee. We need her to get confidence first, and then to go out and play. She's just impactful because she plays at both ends of the floor, and plays hard, and she's a winner. So happy that she got the success tonight and keep building on it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Well, I'm not from here. Geno. Vivian, has been here for B. It's great. It's a full house tonight. It was really loud."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Largest crowd ever.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Loudest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Largest.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,She's not from here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I'm not from here. Loudest? Largest. I'm not from here. It's great. We talked about the winner is women's basketball, WNBA. So many fans coming out to watch these amazing players play, but yeah, they are all welcome. All coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,My coach is coming to Minnesota.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Okay. Kelly is coming.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,Go Ducks.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Absolutely. I think the moment the game ended Thursday night, I was looking forward to Sunday, just to be able to kind of change things, change the narrative a little bit, and know that I'm going to come out and be the same that I was and be obviously better. But throughout this entire process, my team has my back every step of the way and was just excited to have another opportunity to go to battle with them. Because we have a lot of fun in everything that we do, and you know, it's not always like that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"It was the difference in this last game. I think that especially after watching the film of Game 1, we slowed down to a pace that is a little bit awkward for us. We want to play fast and we want to move the ball and we want to get downhill and we want to score, obviously. So making sure that no matter what, we continue to play fast, we get good shots and we get that defense moving."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Understanding how teams are playing me and being able to make that adjustment in real time. Possession by possession, quarter by quarter, teams have kind of changed the way they have guarded, whether they are switching, hedging, trapping. And I think being able to just be poised and understanding what it is that I need to do in order to create an advantage for the team that we have out there on the floor is what I've always wanted to do, and I feel like I've been able to do that in a really good spot. Obviously my teammates set really good screens and are able to get me open in order for me open to create for them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"I'd say it worked pretty well for us, understanding that we use our big lineup and knowing that, you know, we can get the ball inside. We can switch. We're able to apply pressure defensively with our length and being able to get steals and just disrupt their flow. But obviously it's a series and it's a chess match and they are going to throw different adjustments, and I think our ability to stay poised and being able to kind of see what it is that they are doing in real time is going to be crucial. Now we have seen their small ball lineup and we're going to go back and find ways that we can execute while they have that group on the floor."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, I mean, obviously we weren't happy the way we played we and we talked about our principles of play. We have it on our wall, there's a way that we want to play when we are at out best, when we are at pace and moving it, setting good screens and getting second and third side when we need it, but with a good inside-outside attack. We came out, and I think that was very effective for us. We always want to try to get the ball to JJ. They bring a lot of congestion and we probably would have liked to put it in more cleaner in some areas but she demands so much attention down there. I thought the are best thing was obviously just getting on the boards. I think she was fantastic for us. And that's what we need. You know, some games you are going to get more touches than other games and shoot but it's more about playing in the right way and sharing the ball and good to great. I think shot selection wasn't great last game. So it's about making those adjustments and continue to play the way that we want to play."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"I was thinking no, no, she's up -- no, no, she's going to shoot it. But a three-point shot is a layup for her. We encourage her to shoot all those threes. I know she missed one just before it. But I love the confidence that she brings. We talk about her being a rookie. She's not really a rookie. She has this experience in really big moments and the mindset to handle this atmosphere extremely well, and to make a play like that, I mean, I love it. She's an amazing player and an amazing human being."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, you know, I think kind of piggybacking off of the question that I answered from Pepper, it's understanding when I'm getting into the paint, the defense has to make a decision. They are either going to come and take me or they are going to play, you know two on one on the back side, and there's Leo and B in the corner, and as a defender, you just have to take your pick between the two. I was able to just drive in, look her off, and obviously B -- a corner three for B is a layup as well. She shoots that at a really high clip and really well. So I kind of baited Alanna Smith into thinking I was going to pass it high. And B hit a huge shot for us that changed the momentum of the game and continued to extended the lead. I think they called a time-out a little bit after that. It was huge for us. We believe in her. She knows that. This was a huge game. She played a huge role in the game ending up the way that it did and she's going to continue to do it for these next two games, we know that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Look, I think we've been in these moments before on opposing court when it gets really, really loud, and it's more about making sure we stay true to who we are. We kind of know how we want to play. We know that they are going to make runs. We know the crowd is going to get into it. But we've just got to continue to play -- stay true to who the New York Liberty are, and if we can do that, we can overcome any obstacle."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"We have had great starts in both games, but I thought our -- how much they were talking in the huddle, you know, it wasn't just me talking all the time. They're going ""We have got to rebound. The possession game."" I just thought, when we play like that, with the pace that we went out and just the effort and the energy we put into the defensive side with the scramble and the help, good things happen. It was just more about staying persistent. We kept Minnesota to 27 points in that second half, that's pretty good. And some of our scramble defense, we were down 1-0. So you know, we should be playing like that. And now we can tidy up some things and they can tidy up some things as well, too. We'll look forward to playing another tough game on Wednesday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I mean, I think we embrace it. We like it when it's loud. We like it when it's difficult. You know, as we did tonight when it's so loud that you can't hear, you know, just expecting that when we go to Minnesota, hopefully it's going to be an incredible atmosphere for both of those games. But just continuing to stick together, and I think also, the biggest thing behind it is like not getting too high or too low, you know. Things are going to seem bigger than what they are because they are playing at home, and I'm sure Minnesota said the same thing when they are playing here. But yeah, we like to go on the road."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SABRINA IONESCU,"Yeah, obviously I stayed up watching the game, not too late (laughter). But it was a nail-biter. But I mean, after they won the way that they did, today I was like, yeah, I'm going to wear my Oregon shoes because I wanted to embody that tough, gritty win that they pulled off, which is probably one of the biggest wins that our program has had there. A lot of things didn't go right for them and they just continued to fight and stay together and grind out a really big win. I was like, all right, I want to bring that energy with me today on the court and kind of do the same thing. So I think I'm going to wear the same shoes again on Wednesday."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 13, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,Lucky shoes.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We are the first team in WNBA playoff history to be down 15 and come back and win the game. So that ranks really high. I think it defines our team in terms of being able to get through difficult times. That's what we say, we've been talking about, all these interviews we've been given, that's what we are talking about: You have to be mentally tough and resilient. You have to look inward and not blame other people, and give each other confidence. And we were that team. You know, thrilled that we could hang in there."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"I mean, he believes in us like we believe in ourselves. I think we have such a tight-knit circle with our families involved as well, and we all know what we can do in that. We never give up. He embodies all of our families. They all believe that we can come back and we can win and we can stay composed and hopefully win. The basketball gods were on our side tonight."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"Honestly, whatever the folks want to call me, I'm with whatever. As long as they're showing love. If you show me love, you can call me whatever."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,"That's just a testament to how we believe in each other. We have so many great three-point shooters, and the fact that these girls are out here trying to get me the ball, I mean, I could cry. This is amazing. I love it. I say that all the time, and I don't say that for fun. These people I'm around, we believe in each other so much. It's crazy, man. I'm happy to be here."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"From a basketball standpoint, Courtney recognized that she had to get more aggressive. Not pick up her dribble. Her team needed her to be aggressive to go score the basketball. We needed some help. Phee got going as well. But Courtney has been around for a while. She has been in Finals games, and she knows her team needed her to get aggressive."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"I think just taking it one possession at a time. We've been in situations where we've been down before, and that's when we really lean on our defense. That's something we were talking about, getting three stops in a row, chipping at it a little bit at a time. Not thinking about the point difference, but thinking about the possession that we need to get a stop and a score. That's just what we were talking about at halftime. Just every game, I try to go out and impact defensively. Especially when they are going on a run like that, they have amazing offensive players, and so trying to be as disruptive as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"It just goes in preparation. Our coaches do a great job of preparing us and playing tendencies and just playing defense. Again, they are great offensive players. They are going to make plays. I just have to make it as hard as I can."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I don't know where it ranks. It's 1 right now because we are here. I like to be where my feet are planted. So it's 1 right now.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"I'm just happy she made a clutch free throw, if you go and look --"
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,(Laughing).
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"That helped her a little bit, clutch free throws, that was good."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",COURTNEY WILLIAMS,I messed that up (laughing).
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,I didn't feel that way. Those are your words.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"We know it's a long series. Nothing is won in the first quarter. It was not the first quarter that we were hoping for. What our narrative was in the timeouts was just we had to find our footing. Find our footing defensively, and we did the second quarter. We held them to 12 after giving up 32. We went into halftime in good shape. No question about it, the second-chance points are really, really disappointing. That could have really cost us, and we were very, very fortunate that we overcame that. But defensively, we knew what we had to get done. Once our offense improved a little bit and we stopped turning the ball over. But they played terrific. I thought New York played terrific. Their pace was terrific. They run so many great things. They are unique in what they do. They found JJ repeatedly. She had a tremendous game. We had to overcome a lot. And then you look up at the end, and you know, we held them below 40 percent, which is monumental. A lot of that was obviously late. We got big stops when we needed them. Repeatedly, whether ball is going out of bounds or 50/50 balls, referees, whatever happens, jump balls, fouls, all that stuff, we just had to be gritty at the end. We had to get stops to win and that's what I'm proud of."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"Well said. Alanna is one of our highest WARP players, if you're into analytics. She's one of our highest. You know, like you said, she's not going to wow you. She's not going to fly around, scoring the ball, making post moves. It's not her. But what she does for our team, both offensively and defensively, it's not underappreciated, I can tell you that. It's a little bit understated. People have to really watch to recognize what she does for us. Fighting through. Every night, she's playing against the opposing team's big, and she's not big. And so if you look at the success that she has in doing that, it's the reason why we're sitting here today in the Finals. She's Second Team All-Defense, along with (Collier as) Defensive Player of the Year. Those two are the heart and soul of our defense."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"No, it is the margin. It is the margin. But I hear what you're saying, in that when it mattered, we got some hustle plays. And we always say, you never know which one is going to be the difference between winning and losing. That last possession, I think we learned from an earlier playoff game when we were down how we wanted to play that last possession. And so being aggressive and getting the three ball and do what we had to do, if one didn't go in, you know, get as many chances as we could get."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"If the bigs weren't rebounding, might as well go small. Couldn't get any worse, right? What we wanted was a couple ball handlers, get downhill, try to get some easier stuff and pace, etc. That was actually, I don't know if it was Katie (Smith) or Rebekkah (Brunson), but it was something that they asked for and it was a really good call."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,"Yeah, it felt like we got a second chance. Obviously you don't want to be put in that position. Wish I wouldn't have fouled. Wish it wouldn't have been called, whatever it was. But yeah, you're not thinking about that in the second. You're just thinking making sure they didn't get the rebound, making sure we're boxing out and going to our next play. So yeah, that's what I was thinking about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",NAPHEESA COLLIER,I didn't know she was here.
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"She was texting to the bench. A lot of the good stuff we did, she was sending (laughter)."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CHERYL REEVE,"The games that we were talking about, we were up. We were managing leads. We weren't finishing well. The fundamental difference is we were down. So obviously we finish games better when we're down, based on the playoffs. But that was what I was referring to, was managing leads better, playing all the way through to the end of the game."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Welcome to Game 1 of the WNBA Finals. I'm excited to be here in New York City as the Liberty take on the Minnesota Lynx. As you all know, the Liberty and Lynx were the two best teams in the WNBA all year, with both at the top of the standings for much of the season. The Liberty, one of the league's original franchises, are making their second straight Finals appearance and looking to win their first WNBA championship. Obviously, they won the Commissioner's Cup the other year (2023). The Lynx, one of the most decorated franchises in WNBA history, are looking to win a league-record fifth title and are appearing in a record seventh Finals. They're looking to become the second team to sweep both the Commissioner's Cup and the WNBA Finals trophy. With Napheesa having such a career year, along with the play in New York with Sabrina and Stewie and the storylines about Leonie Fiebich, her first year in the league, All-Rookie Team, and free-agency signings in Minnesota with Courtney Williams and Alanna Smith and so many more storylines, I'm just excited to get this tipped off. The Finals mark the culmination of what I think is the most transformational year in the WNBA's history. You saw all the statistics we put out: viewership, attendance, merch sales, digital engagement at or near record levels. To put it in perspective with a few stats that bring insight into what has happened, the WNBA has significantly outpaced the industry in average consumption of live games in 2024. Fans watched 30 percent more minutes on average of each WNBA game in the 2024 regular season. Our games reached a record 54 million viewers in the 2024 regular season. Younger, more diverse audiences are imperative to the growth of the sports industry, and they flocked to the WNBA this season. Viewership by fans under 35 increased 211 percent, led by a 259 percent increase in viewership from Gen Z and millennial women. Our focus on our direct-to-consumer platforms led to record-breaking content consumption and repeated fan engagement. WNBA App downloads surpassed 1 million this year, and monthly active users skyrocketed 252 percent. Social engagement increased nearly 300 percent across all of our league channels. There was an astounding 872 percent increase in WNBA App story views, which I know I watch my kids watching all the little stories that we put out there. Last time we gathered for the Finals, in 2023, we had just announced the Golden State expansion franchise. Since then, we have announced two more expansion teams to begin play in 2026, Toronto and Portland, with one more team to begin play by no later than the 2028 season, to get us to 16 teams. This summer we signed a groundbreaking media rights deal that will grow the economics of our league and expand the reach and accessibility of our game for our fans, with additional WNBA media deals to come. As you know, early in the season, after seeing the growth trajectory we were on and with a challenging game footprint given the Olympics, we implemented full charter flights for the entire season plus playoffs. This growth has not come without growing pains. The hateful speech and threats directed at our players are troubling. That type of conduct is not representative of the WNBA's character or fan base. As a league, we stand united in condemning racism and all forms of hate. The WNBA is one of the most inclusive and diverse professional sports leagues in the world, and we will continue to champion those values. We'll meet with the Players Association, the players, teams. We'll work together to expand and enhance our efforts and are going to approach this multidimensionally, utilizing technology, prioritizing mental health, reinforcing physical security and increasing monitoring. We know there's more work to be done, and as a league, we are fully committed to listening to the players and other stakeholders on this and other important issues. Finally, before we get to your questions, we have some news to announce: Starting next year with the 2025 WNBA season, the WNBA Finals presented by YouTube TV will be a best-of-seven format, replacing the current best-of-five format. The Finals will take on a 2-2-1-1-1 structure, in which the team with the higher seed will host Games 1, 2, 5 and 7, and its opponent will host Games 3, 4 and 6. This will give our fans a championship series format that they are accustomed to seeing in other sports. We will also be changing our first round to a 1-1-1 setup for the best-of-three series. We have contemplated both these changes since the pandemic. We would have done it in the current year, but with the Olympic break this year, it wasn't possible. But now that we have charters throughout the season and playoffs, it's feasible. So to summarize, in 2025 we will have a best-of-three first round, five in the semifinals and seven in the WNBA Finals. In addition, the 2025 regular season will increase from 40 to 44 games per team. Honestly, the league's growth and increased demand for WNBA basketball made this the ideal time to expand the schedule, lengthen the Finals and provide fans more opportunities to see the best players in the world compete at the highest level. I also want to take the opportunity to let you know that the WNBA Draft Lottery 2025 presented by State Farm will be broadcast on Sunday, November 17, at 5 p.m. Eastern on ESPN. With that, I want to thank you for your coverage this year. It really has made a difference. I really am very grateful to be standing here as the commissioner of a league that has been through so much. To have you all in this room and reporting on this league as you have all year, very grateful for that. With that, happy to answer any questions."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, first of all, there's no place in sports for this. Just continue to condemn it, continue to be a voice on this. Also, I think we have been already meeting with some technology providers. I think there are some technology solutions out there that we could deploy and employ. Of course, we want to meet with the players and see what they want to do around that. But there are some technology companies we've been meeting with to see what we can do. It just is something where we have to continue to be a voice for this, a voice against it, condemning it, and making sure that we find every opportunity to support our players, who have been dealing with this for much longer than this year, by the way. I think Sue Bird said that the other day very eloquently. We need to continue to see how we can support the mental health resources, physical security, cybersecurity. We're going to attack it, as I said, multidimensionally. We're going to try to figure out how we can best work with the players as to how they want us to help solve this issue."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, well, next year we do not have any international competition. No FIBA World Cup and no Olympic break, so we should have a nice footprint. It's hard to start much earlier because we obviously have the college season. The college draft is such a great feeder system into the WNBA and creates a lot of excitement, as you've seen over the past few years and probably since the league started. I think probably not starting much earlier. Certainly we're well into October by the time we finish the Finals, especially if we go to five games this year, next year seven. So we'll probably go a little bit later in October. But again, we'll have a decent footprint next year to fit in the 44. Remember, we have an additional team joining next year, in Golden State Valkyries. So I think it'll be great. We'll have obviously the condensed Commissioner's Cup a few weeks, culminating in that championship, as well. I think next year will be a good footprint. We'll have to look at the following year because that is the FIBA World Cup year. Obviously, we'll be good in 2027, and then it'll be LA '28. It's a constant balancing of the schedule. I think we feel very good about where we'll be next year, for sure, on the footprint."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"So that date in November was draft lottery, not the draft. Yes. The Golden State Valkyries will pick fifth in each round. The lottery picks will be the four (teams) that you probably have already done the calculations on, but we'll obviously put a release out after this press conference on exactly that, and then the Golden State Valkyries will have the fifth pick in each round."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"It's a good question on what's next as it relates to our globalization platform. Obviously, we played Toronto, we played in Edmonton. That was kind of our Canada series. Now we'll have a team in Toronto starting in '26. Sure, we'd like to play in more places -- EMEA, Asia, Africa, Latin and South America, I know Mexico City has shown interest, as well as a variety of other cities across the world. Obviously, I was in Paris for the Olympics this year. Thought it was amazing, the support for women's basketball there. I'll never forget on the Friday night when Belgium played France in the women's game. I'd say that was the best crowd that I saw watch a game there. Obviously, a lot of Belgians could drive there to Paris. It was great to see the growth of the game globally. I think our players represent such great role models to those communities in lifting women. I've admired what the NBA has done with their Global Games platform, playing around the world. I think we'll be on a path there as we get into 2025 and beyond."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"That will be something I'm sure in collective bargaining that we'll sit down with the players and Players Association. I think one thing that you noticed in the last year or two, particularly this year, a lot of our veterans were in camp, training camp. Obviously, they have to show up by May 1, and I think it was important. I think you saw the quality of the game in the first few weeks because of that. I also think you saw the quality of the Commissioner's Cup play, which is toward the front half of the season to give that some more relevance. Again, I'm sure it'll be something we continue to discuss and talk about."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so again, we work with FIBA. We're working with all the constituents on how we can make this all work, where they can have vibrant, competitive seasons. We can have our vibrant, competitive season. Obviously, some have moved their dates to end earlier to make sure that those vets -- remember, our prioritization rule does not apply to rookies in their first couple years, but for those vets to come over and play in the best league in the world. But we have a good relationship with FIBA. Working through with them. And again, I think in 2025 -- that's another impediment to starting earlier, to the question about starting earlier, not only the college draft and college season going into the beginning of April, we need to have a training camp, but also the Euro leagues, as well, play into April now, into May. I think on balance, I think we all want to grow the game globally. I think it's going to come down to footprints and seasons and how we can do it, which is why most of what we're doing in expanding our season will be on the back end."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, absolutely. We're always scenario planning around a variety of different outcomes. Certainly, I engage with Nneka and Terri throughout the year, every month, every other week during the season. I really respect the player leadership. I think this is going to be an opportunity to listen to one another and take this league to the next level for generations to come. I look forward to building the future of the league and sitting down with the players. Whether they opt out, not opt out. I suspect that given the transformation of the league that we've been working so hard on, building this long-term economic model, we've already returned to the players through charter, through increasing playoff bonuses a couple years ago by over 50 percent. So we'll continue to do that, and when we get to the bargaining table we'll continue to talk about the issues that are most important to the players. We actually look forward to engaging in that now that we've kind of gotten the media deal we discussed, corporate partners, just everything. There's virtually not a sporting event you can turn on where one of our players is not in an ad spot. That was not happening five years ago. Look at Aliyah Boston and Sabrina and A'ja and so many of our players in these ad spots. I think that's a good sign, too, as we think about the future of this game and the future of the agreement between the Players Association and the owners."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, one thing that as a very long-term sports fan I know is that officiating and refereeing is always at the top of the fan's list, of the media's list. Obviously, we work hard on training. We work hard on consistency. Obviously, not every -- they're humans. Looking at technology, basketball is a little more complex than tennis, for instance, around technology, of officiating. We're looking at a variety of different dimensions, but we'll continue training. We have a lot of veteran officials. You'll see them out here working the Finals. But we always know there's always work to do, always get better. We review in our Competition Committee meetings, officiating and points of emphasis and things like that. We'll caucus with Bethany Donaphin, our head of league operations, and our referee operations, as well. We'll caucus to make sure we're putting out the best officiating we can. But I know it's a passionate issue. Every fan group -- I love when I go into market and every fan group I meet with, they usually wait and ask it as the last question of the night. But they do ask about officiating, which I appreciate the passion for that."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"So on your first question, we do hear from NBA players who are very interested in investing in WNBA teams. There's a lot of capital inflow coming into women's sports, as many of you are hearing and reading, and obviously we were one of the first and only to raise at the scale we did, $75 million back in 2022. We brought in former NBA players into that capital raise and former WNBA players into that capital raise. So yes, we do get interest from time to time. Now, the NBA investments by those players is in independent teams, not in NBA-affiliated teams. So if you're still playing for an NBA team, you probably want to invest in the WNBA team with your affiliate, and you can't do that until you graduate, I'll call it, or retire from basketball. So we have a lot of interest from that perspective. Then again, we want to listen to the players as to how they want to think about anything that we go to the bargaining table on, whether that's equity stakes or other issues that they might be interested in. We're certainly willing to listen. I think it is complicated when you have a Players Association versus the league versus the owners who are all small businesses, right. Well, 13, now we'll have 15 to 16, and they're each individual businesses. I think it's a little more complicated because there's no one equity stake. Like Unrivaled, it is one league with equity stake in, and it's not teams. We've got 12, soon to be 16, teams in a league. So it's a little more complicated, I think."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, it's certainly something that we look at for all of our teams every year, as well as you mentioned the expansion teams. I think my comments on the expansion teams were you want to make sure the expansion owners know, when you come into the league, it's a competitive league. Free agency is competitive now, and all of our owners are investing. You see investing in practice facilities and other player experiences. I think we want those expansion teams to come in and be the most successful they can. I think, you may have a different view, but I think our current owners are all growing in the same direction as far as how they know they need to get free agents to build a championship squad. Obviously great rookies, too, become veterans later on. I don't have a bias against any one team. Obviously, we have teams playing in different size arenas. You saw some teams upgrade those arenas for certain games this year, and I thought that was a sign and signal that as has attendance had a grown across the league that we can play in bigger arenas. I think when I came into this league, someone said you should all be playing in 5,000-seat arenas. Can you imagine what you're going to see out here tonight if that was in a 5,000-seat arena? No, there's going 17,000-plus people here. And we had our highest-attended game ever, over 20,000, in Washington this year. I think we do have standards, by the way, across the board for facilities, practice facilities and things like that. The owners now know that there's an edge to showing a player investment in the things like facilities, et cetera, especially practice facilities. I was in Phoenix for the All-Star Game this year taking a tour of their new practice facilities that they opened. Vegas has done it, Seattle has done it, Dallas is going to do it. I think Phoenix I mentioned, and Chicago is looking at upgrading. I think all of our -- we already had some great practice facilities already in the league in Indy, Minnesota, et cetera, and here in New York. I think, again, there's no -- we do have standards, but there's nothing where we're saying any one owner is not up to their standards today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, so just in general for the 16th spot, as I've mentioned, the good news is we have a lot of demand from many cities. I'd say 10 or so, maybe even plus at this point, because I think the more people are watching the WNBA and seeing what we're growing here and seeing these players and the product on the court, more people are interested in having it in their cities. They see the economic impact of having a WNBA team in their city, the role model in the community these players represent. So I've said Philly is on the list, and Philly is on the list. Now that we have the three teams, two in '26, one next year, we're not in a huge rush. We'd like to bring it in in '27 or no later than '28, as I mentioned. So I'd say there's 10 to 12 cities that are very viable that we're evaluating, and we have a process. I'd say I don't have a deadline by which we have to name it because it'll be out to '27 or '28, but I would think in the next couple months or so we'll start -- now as we get into the offseason, we'll start taking a look at those that will go to the top of the list through our process. Again, it's all the same types of things I've been talking about for the other three around arena, practice facility, player experience, committed long-term ownership group, city, demographics, psychographics, Fortune 500 companies based there. All the things we've been looking at in all of our cities and our data analysis. And then we've built some good relationships with some of the potential cities as they've started to engage with the league on an expansion team."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",CATHY ENGELBERT,"Yeah, I think if you look at the diversity of when we did our capital raise, you'll see a fair amount of diversity in the ownership group we brought in there, investor group. Obviously, we talk with our owners all the time about diversity in the coaching ranks, in their front office, back office, et cetera. You see every year we score very well in our report on that. We have a lot of assistant coaches that have been previous WNBA players and represent a very diverse group, as well. We have all of our owners partnering with minority-owned businesses. We partner at the league with Mielle, who is one of our newer partners. Playa Society. I think one of our teams just got a Partake Foods jersey patch; that's a minority-owned business. We're looking at it from all these angles, partnerships, ranks of our employee base and certainly the coaching diversity and coaching, as well. So it is important to us. There's not a Board of Governors meeting that we don't talk about this. As you know, we've made enormous progress especially in the assistant coaching ranks with former WNBA players by essentially focusing on this over the last couple years. Made enormous progress, which is why our report card is really good. But it's something that you can never rest on, so I appreciate the question. We've had a couple coaches exit, so I think we have three open coaching spots. Obviously, the Golden State Valkyries announced their first head coach in their franchise history today. We have three open coaching spots. So we'll certainly be looking for our owners to have a diverse pool of candidates, and ultimately they'll make the decision on their head coaches."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"We just take it on the chin, you know. We were up a lot and then we had a wild kind of sequence to end the fourth. Didn't start overtime great. I had a great look at the end and I didn't make it. But I think that this is a series. We wanted to really win, obviously, for home court. But the beauty is, we have another game on Sunday and we'll be ready."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, it's probably a lot of things. I could probably give you a better answer tomorrow. I just thought we went away from our principles of play. I think we had a great first quarter, and then they lifted up the energy and they outhustled us. I think we forced some of the action. We weren't moving it good enough. We couldn't get downhill as much. You know, we missed a lot of shots. We missed a lot of shots. Just the principles of play for us. How we want to play, get to the next action. But look, defensively, I think they executed better than us. That's what it came down to. They executed better than us. They found a way to win. They made some big shots, timely shots when they needed to. We're disappointed. We have to be better. We're a better team than what we showed today."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I mean, I think it's pretty clear, JJ had an amazing game, and the way that she was aggressive from start to finish is exactly what we need. I think that we got a lot of looks. Like, 90 shots is a lot, and we missed them. I think just coming out and understanding the game plan a little bit better, and always being on our front foot. I felt like there was just a few situations, time and score toward the end of the game, that really hurt us. But collectively there's a lot of things that you could kind of look at and be like, well, this is one of the reasons why we lost."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they took us out of what we wanted to run. They were really aggressive. They were blowing up stuff. We couldn't get clear passes. We tried to go downhill and they would stunt and get back, and we just got a little bit stagnant. Then we had obviously -- I thought we were slow. We were up so you're trying to move the ball, but then we are slow in our speed, execution speed, and then it was making it easy for them. And they made plays. They made plays down the other end. Obviously we contested it -- we give them a three, a four-point play. Those things, they can break your back, and they did. We had our opportunities to win and we didn't finish it. We're disappointed. We have to go back to work. We have to freshen up. We have to look at how we can be better, and it's really just principles of play. Things that we have been great at all season long, we have to just refocus on them."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"I think the missed free throw because we had an opportunity to go up one. But even still, at the end of overtime, I had probably one of my cleanest looks. Didn't make it."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"I mean, they switched with us a little bit more to stop us from going downhill. I don't know, I think the weight of the game was more about us, like Sandy said, getting away from our principles versus what they did to kind of get us out of rhythm."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, look, I think they were throwing different coverages at her, with the switching and she was trying to go probably a little bit too much one-on-one early. We've just got to move the ball and trust that the ball will come back to her in that regard and exploit it. We had a tough night. We had a tough shooting night. We all did. But what I know, Sabrina is a competitor. She'll get ready for Game 2 and come back strong."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Listen, I want to be taking these shots. I feel like knowing my teammates and that everyone has confidence in me is important. It's kind of like on to the next and still making sure I'm aggressive any time on the court. Obviously as a player, it's very frustrating. But bounce back for Game 2."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",JONQUEL JONES,"It was a point of emphasis for us coming into the game, just to control the rebounding and really get on the boards and try to exploit them in that way. It's something that we're going to have to continue to do to be successful. But like Stewie and Coach said, we had a lot of opportunities to close the game out. A few things that we have to change and kind of be aware of moving forward, but still some things to build upon and things to learn from."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,"Yeah, a hundred percent. It's principles of plays at both ends. Being at the point of the screen, Kayla McBride is coming off and shooting it, and then letting them go downhill, pressuring and letting Hiedeman dribble by us and giving them too many easy looks where we should have been just a little bit smarter in our defense there. Sometimes when we didn't rebound or we kind of -- we went to offensive rebound but we are out of position and they got easy layups in transition. So those really break your back. Principles of play in the half court. Pace is there, but I think we got a little stagnant and a little tired. But credit to them. They were blowing us up and they were being really physical. They were very active. They were switching it, and then that took us out of it a little bit. We've got to be better and we will be better."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",BREANNA STEWART,"Yeah, I think it's, specifically to that play because they were reviewing the time, you're just focusing on making the shot. Making the first one. Making the first one. Making the first one. And then the second one, the same. It's when you want to be thinking about nothing else. It definitely sucks to miss."
2024 - WNBA FINALS: MINNESOTA VS. NEW YORK,"October 10, 2024",SANDY BRONDELLO,I think just the start we did have. We put up 32 points. We were very intentional playing defense. We were making it really hard for them to score. Some easy baskets. We were making shots and moving the ball really quick. But they went to another level. So they kind of took us out of a rhythm. Not surprised us. We knew what they are capable of doing. But we've got to get back and just play Liberty basketball.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely a little bit anxious. A little bit nervousness in there, just because I had no idea where I was going. I kind of told my agent to keep it a secret from me. I just want to be surprised. For me, I just wanted to land somewhere that would develop me and kind of make me into the best basketball that I can be. I'm happy that I landed with Utah. Definitely excited. Felt relief when I heard my name called, so that's probably the biggest one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I think the biggest way I fit in is just my versatility. When you come in at such a young age, and being able to play multiple positions and guard multiple positions, I really feel like that allows you to fit in with the dynamic of the team just because you can do so much and fit in with different needs. That's the biggest part. There's a lot of talented guys on that team. I could go down the list and do their whole lineup that I can fit in with. But the biggest thing is they are young and I could develop and learn with them and kind of build that young core. That's probably the part I'm most excited about with this team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Just being himself really. I feel like that's how he differentiates himself on and off the court and really made a name for himself. Being himself includes not only his personality but also his work ethic and how hard he worked to get to where he is and where he is going to continue to go to. I feel like just taking those aspects of his game and his mentality, how he approached every workout, every rep, every charity event, every media coverage, I feel like I can use that and take that with me and use it throughout my career. That's how I'm going to grow and develop."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Most definitely. We're going to talk crazy during that tame. I'll tell you right now. It's something we dreamed about. As kids, obviously we never really got to play against or with each other on the same team just because of the age difference. So I think being able to do that now is definitely a dream come true. I'm going to make sure I'm matched up on him when we're playing them. Make sure, tell Will, put me on (Jalen Williams). That's the game plan."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I think it just goes to show the type of parents I have and the type of people I have in my life and my family members, just the values they installed in both of us. That's why we ended up this way. So I know they are extremely proud watching us reach our dreams. That's the biggest thing for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"We practiced it a lot, I'm not going to lie. Two years ago, we messed it up. We were practicing for a few days, maybe even a week up until this point, to make sure we nailed it. Add a little flair to it. So we made up for it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I've just got baby steps into the fashion industry, I'm not going to lie to you. This is the first time I stepped out and wore something expensive. I think for me it might be something a little hobby I'll pick up, but I'm just starting to get into fashion and just starting to figure it out. I'll probably learn from him as I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, it's hard to say just because we play two different styles of basketball. I don't know what your definition of better is. I hope to become an elite two-way player, playing offense and defense and doing that at the highest level and being one of those elite two-way players in the NBA, as I go throughout my career. Yeah, I strive to be better than him. Obviously a little sibling rivalry, but we also play like completely different just with the way our bodies are built. So you know, that's the answer you're looking for."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Definitely gaming. I would say gaming, for sure, is one of the biggest ones. Fashion, stepping into it a little bit. I'm a huge movie guy. That's something I always been into. Just pick up a movie and watch it. I love cinematography, so that's definitely probably the biggest one. I like bowling and starting to pick up golf too. Have a lot more free time, so I can start getting good at golf and getting a routine for it. But definitely bowling is another activity I'm heavy on."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"Yeah, probably. And a lot of family time. That's probably going to be a heavy dose of it, spend as much time as I can with friends and family, while also obviously staying locked in on basketball. But enjoying the moments with them before the season gets hectic and I'm going to be traveling all over the place."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",CODY WILLIAMS,"I mean, go to this afterparty. That's probably the biggest thing. I'm looking forward to enjoying that. Got all my closest friends and family there. I guess that's on my bucket list to enjoy."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"It was a surreal feeling. I mean, especially just sitting in that chair waiting, just to figure out which team was going to get me. For them to pick me, a lot of emotions were just going through me. I'm definitely blessed."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"All of them are hardworking. They push their players past their limits. I feel like that's the best place for me. Especially with me going there, I know they are going to push me past my limits, push me past that wall to be the best player that I can be and compete."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"Well, like you said, they have their trust in Bam. So I feel like once they have trust with me, it comes with me showing them that in practice. I feel like that's something that would elevate my game, just having that trust in me that I go out and make the right plays."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KEL'EL WARE,"A lot of people go into the transfer portal for money. I went in there for the right fit and I found the right fit. That definitely helped my career. Going into my sophomore season, actually getting to know the coaches. Just learning more things about the team just before I made the decision."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JA'KOBE WALTER,I've got to go with Drake. OVO. OVO.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, I think the more I develop, I'll definitely be able to initiate offense at the one. Played two and three before. I think playing in the NBA, playing around in practice, I think I'll start to get used to it more, and then I think I can really take that role to the next level."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JA'KOBE WALTER,"I've never been to Toronto. I've never even been to Canada. But I know that it's a nice city in Canada, and all I really know is the building."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JA'KOBE WALTER,"Yeah, the guards, we're a close group at Baylor. Every year, there's six guards. Y'all are competing against each other every day. Y'all are getting better watching a lot of film. We actually do call it Guard U. Me being the next one out is a blessing from God. I'm just super grateful to be in this position and I hope that I'm going to represent Baylor well."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",NIKOLA TOPIC,"I did not visit Oklahoma. Every organization that I've been to, I met some really nice people. That is with Oklahoma, also. Very, very nice coach. GMs, everybody, I'm just excited to meet them in person and talk to them. And yeah, that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, it was great. But I had injuries, so sadly, I didn't play more. But I tried to take my time and to be with them, to talk with them, even with the injury. So yeah, I really enjoyed it there. I made some really good friends and friendships forever.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",NIKOLA TOPIC,"Yeah, I talked with Micic. He just told me everything the best about not just the Thunder, but the whole NBA. And of course, Durisic, Nikola and I got really close this year. I really enjoyed playing with him. It was easy, as I can say. I hope he will get drafted as high as possible. It meant a lot that I had him here. We were together in Miami. We shared some good memories at times. We visit some places. It's great to have him here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",NIKOLA TOPIC,"Not yet. I've been coming back slowly. But we'll talk tomorrow with the team and the team doctor and see what's the best for me, and we'll do that."

It's really great to have him there. He's coming into the third year, and he's done a really good job the past two. And not just him, the players and the whole organization. I think we can do more."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",REED SHEPPARD,"It was unbelievable. It was a dream come true. It's something that I've been dreaming of since I've been a little kid. Having my family with me at the table, my coach, my agent, having my family in the crowd, I couldn't ask for anything else. It was my mom's birthday today, so that's an awesome thing to celebrate as well. I'm at a loss for words. I'm super happy to be here and super thankful."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",REED SHEPPARD,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is just going in and learning. You have guys like Fred VanVleet that I'll be able to learn from. Just going in with an open mind, ready to learn, ready to do whatever it takes to win.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I had a workout a couple weeks ago. I really enjoyed the time that I spent with them trying to understand their philosophy. As soon as we were talking, kind of understand more about the organization. Just start to present myself and told them what I was ready to do for them. I was saying that I wanted to contribute to -- I want to be a part of a winning team and contribute to winning and compete. For that, I say that I was ready to do whatever it takes to do it. Basically my versatility could be -- defensively in this league is really important. Trying to guard multiple positions, trying to be aggressive. I will know more soon, but now that's what I've got to say right now."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"That's amazing. We are trying to represent our country, and I'm so glad to be a part of it. There is more players coming in.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I'm not shocked. I'm not shocked. I've known Tidjane and Alex for a long time. We grew up playing against each other. So I know them really well. Like I said, that's amazing for our country. That's amazing for us, first of all. Just to be able to realize our dream together is special. I feel like French players are going to take some inspiration, and that's going to be better and better for us. I really feel lucky because there's so many young players that are good. That's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"I'm a versatile player. I feel like I can fit easily into this team. I can't wait to figure out what is going to be my role or my goals, or, you know, just to make sure we win games. So I don't know yet, but I know that I can do a lot of things. Defend multiple positions, grabbing some rebounds, finishing strong, being aggressive, shooting threes obviously. I think that's going to be -- that's a part of my game. That's something that I need to keep it up for helping the team to win the next season, because I know that we are going to have to shoot the ball. And that's it."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ZACCHARIE RISACHER,"For now, I just want -- I just know the facilities of the Hawks. I can't wait to get in there and to just work in those conditions. I think that's a style of life that I'm not used to. I talk about the gym, the cold baths, locker room, whatever. I feel like if I could basically sleep in the gym. In Bourg-en-Bresse, which is a great gym, too, but not as good as the Hawks have. I can really sleep in the gym."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",YVES MISSI,"The workout went well. It was probably one of my favorite ones, actually. I just really liked the coaching staff and the organization in general. I had an opportunity to spend time with them, and just being able to talk with them and interact with them. They just talked about the plan and what they are thinking about next year, and then what they are looking for in a big. And then obviously the workout, they gave me some advice on how to get better.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",YVES MISSI,"I haven't been playing basketball that long. I'm still learning each and every day, every time I step on the court. Obviously, I wasn't ranked and it wasn't something I was paying attention to. To be honest, I was trying to have fun on the court. Obviously, brought me from Cameroon all the way to here. You never know where the basketball can take you. Just being here is amazing. It's a blessing and I have to thank God to be able to put me in this position."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Not really. I feel like my game is dissected very much so, whether it's being non-athletic, non-defender. So it's something I take as a challenge.

It's a blessing to even be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm just excited to learn from him, learn from both Maxey and him. Obviously they are elite scorers, so I think I can space the floor and create space for them. I'm excited to get to know them and learn as much as possible from them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I'm excited. Obviously Maxey, I've heard great things (about) him. Watching him on the court, he's an elite player. Being able to play alongside him and learn from him. On draft night, there's surprises everywhere. So I didn't know where I was going. I tried not to get attached to any teams. So yeah, I guess it is a surprise, but I'm happy to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Not yet. I sent Maxey my number, and I got to talk to the GM, the coach. Not too much. But I'm excited to get to know them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",JARED McCAIN,"Yeah, I think it's my natural emotion, is just to be happy, be joyful. So there's no reason to change that when I'm on the court. I'm always going to embrace the challenge, obviously, but I'm going to have fun with it. Whether I make a three, make a good play, the team is excited, the crowd is excited. I'm going to be smiling probably no matter what. So it's something I bring everywhere I go."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DALTON KNECHT,"I'd say my why is I feel like I've been underrated my whole entire life ever since I was coming out of high school.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",AJ JOHNSON,"I would say that you just got to sometimes really just pop out and just show people, for real. You've just got to not want to duck or be scared.

It's all up to you if you choose to believe in that or not. So they did that with me, Toumani (Camara), Obi (Toppin) and all the guys before that. I decided to choose and I believe in it, and I'm here where I am now because of that. Very grateful for them."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DaRON HOLMES II,"It was pretty cool. Great to see those players and a lot of great talent in there. I'm just happy to be where I'm at. Perfect fit. I'm very excited. I was excited the whole time. A little nervous. Great to see all my boys there watching me, but it's just great to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DaRON HOLMES II,"Oh, yeah, that's perfect. Great fit. I saw something that I get free (nuggets) from Wendy's. That's pretty cool. Other than that, I'm excited to get out there and play. It's a great team and a great organization for a reason. I'm going to get better and keep going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DaRON HOLMES II,"Probably an inhaler because I heard that -- what's it called, the altitude? I'm playing. I'll be all right. Honestly, I don't know. I'm just going to embrace it all and just be ready for it. I'm excited."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"It means a lot coming from that program. Knowing that program just got shut down and I was the last bunch of that. Definitely taught me a lot on and off the court, really a lot of the things (about) life and (being) mentally healthy and just learning how the NBA operates. On the court, this might be surprising to say, but all the losing that we did, I definitely learned a lot more than if we would have won a lot. I think that definitely prepared me a lot for the NBA because you're going to go through a lot of things with the NBA. It's going to be a lot of things that you need to be able to talk about or just have an outlet to and just being able to figure things out quickly just to move on to the next."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"I'm looking forward to changing things around. I know they have a stigma on them when it comes to a lot of losing, and I feel like I'm a huge part to be able to start to change that around. I have a willingness to win and I feel like me going into this franchise, being able to help them out with this good group of guys, good group of young guys that they have, I'm definitely super excited to get down there and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"I appreciate all the love and support you've given me throughout the whole season, and I'm finally here and I wouldn't be here without y'all. Like I said, I really appreciate all the love and support and all the competitive people in the G League. I appreciate y'all. It was a huge honor being able to play, going straight out of high school. I'm definitely blessed and honored to be in the situation I'm in."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"What excites me is really the basketball portion of it, for sure. I heard you have a huge fan base when it comes to basketball, so that's definitely something I'm looking forward to getting into. I'm a huge community guy, so I definitely see myself getting into that community as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"I would say just talk to everybody that has been with me throughout this whole process and really sit down and tell them how thankful I am for that. I've been through so much. Just being able to be here, blessed with this opportunity God has put me in. I'm super thankful for everyone who has been part of my journey. Once I tell them that, everything will be said and done and I'll be on my way to Detroit, and get settled in and have a good one."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RON HOLLAND II,"Super proud of Matas. Knowing the role we had to take up on Ignite and meeting him throughout high school and being able to play against him and with him in the Ignite season, first of all, I'm super proud of him just knowing and seeing the man that he is becoming. I'm really super excited to see where his NBA career goes and super excited to compete against him as well. That's going to go a long way. That's going to be super exciting matchups here in the future soon. Like I said, I'm just super proud of him and I'm super excited for him."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KYSHAWN GEORGE,Just enjoying the moment with my family and grateful and very happy that my name got called.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KYSHAWN GEORGE,"I mean, great. I think I can bring a lot to this team with my versatility, my size, my length, my IQ and my shooting ability. I think I will fit in very well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",KYSHAWN GEORGE,"They are expecting hard work. Obviously, I can provide that. Just overall, like I said before, my versatility, shooting ability, spacing the floor and how smart I am with the ball."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"Everything that I thought of came to life. Flashbacks from when I was young. Just dreaming of being in this position, walking across that stage in my mind. Hearing my name be called and walk across the stage today, it all came true. It was just God gave me this to be here."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"Yes, sir."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"It helped me a lot. That program at Lu High was probably the best decision I made, to go for my two years' program. I'm forever grateful to Coach (John) Buck and Coach Josh (Corbin) to give me an opportunity to play there. Their practices are like college practices. So I was prepared to go into that. Just having the competitive mindset helped me a lot."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"I think it was Coach Bennett. I wasn't really known as a good defender coming out of high school. Once I got to UVA and had my growth spurt, I think I got some God-given talents. Coach Bennett drilled that mindset in me, and I was able to take off at Virginia."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"I'm excited. I'm excited. Great program. They want to win a championship and they have got great players to do it. I'm going to try to get down there, go to work and see what I've got to do to get there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"Yeah, I think I can. It's just getting a lot of reps in practice and everything like that. Just getting the confidence and just let it go. That's what I'm going to try to do in Phoenix, is be in the gym a lot. Just do what I've got to do as a team."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,I am. Born and raised.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"It's crazy because he lives in Arizona as well. We are both going to be in the same state again living together. It's going to be good. Being from New York representing not only as two athletes but as brothers in different sports, it's amazing and I'm grateful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,He's actually in Arizona. That's where he's staying. He's rehabbing on that.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",RYAN DUNN,"He's not with a team, but he's going to start throwing for a team soon."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"I'd say it's just a blessing, for real, to even be here because you work your whole life and you never know if you're going to make it. So when you finally get there, it's just a blessing. Yeah, playing with Anthony Edwards and the whole Timberwolves. They were in the Western Conference Finals. So it's really just a blessing because I get to learn from a lot of players and veterans and players that are real good. Them helping me is just a plus for me. I didn't really get to work out with them, but I used to see Ant at (Overtime Elite) a lot, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's a blessing, for real. It shows that they trust me and they obviously are trusting in me to develop. If they trust in me, that's all I needed. I feel that's all I needed from any team. Them showing me is even more of a blessing. I get to play with way better players and learn from them. I'd say it's a blessing to even be here in this situation. I thank the Timberwolves, for sure."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"I would say the open space on the floor. There's so much open floor, and I feel like I'm quick so I can get past dudes. It's really the fact of me getting past dudes and making decisions. You're playing with a bunch of NBA players, so players can't really help off super a lot because these are NBA players and they knock down shots. I feel like, for me, getting past my defender and making plays for my teammates will be way easier, and then if they don't help, then it's just a bucket."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"I feel like it would be easier. Once I know the assignment and what my coach wants me to do, it's not really me adjusting. It's just me doing what he says. I feel like anything Coach tells me to do, I can adjust to and I can make it happen. So I feel like it's a good feel, for real."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ROB DILLINGHAM,"It's crazy. It just shows you a lot of things work in ways you never think because we came in and we were roommates and we were really in the same position. We didn't know if we were going to get past our first year. We were just playing basketball. Me seeing Reed, my roommate, he's a great dude. He always pushed me and he always helped me. Me seeing him and we going together, it's just crazy to even see, and I'm thankful."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I feel like I fit in great. I'm going to make sure that I get myself adjusted to whatever the team needs, whatever the players on that team need for us to be successful. With my high IQ and my versatility, I feel like there's a lot of different spots that I can fill and a lot of different needs I can address."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Basketball IQ, for sure. Making the right reads. Making smart plays. Being in the right position. I feel like that's very underrated, being in the right position and reading your defender. That's a lot of my game where I get my advantages from. I'm going to continue it do that, and I feel like that's going to help everybody else on the floor as well."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"Right, to the efficiency point. I feel like that's huge for me, just because I like to play the right way. I feel like me playing the right way is me getting good shots, whether that's open shots or good layups at the rim. I feel like I'm just reading the game and adjusting to whatever the defense does. When I get a good look, it's more prone to go in than not. And then to your other point, hopefully we'll make it three. That would be really historic. Yeah, Colorado is not looked at as a draft pick-producing university like these other programs are. But if you look at the history, there's a lot of really, really solid players that have stuck around a long time in the league. It's just a testament to what Coach Boyle and his coaching staff have done at Colorado."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I'm excited to get to know them even more. We've got mutual friends. I've met them for the first time this past summer when my brother was playing on the national team and I went up there to Berlin to watch one of the games. But great people. They know my brother more than they know me, but they have already reached out to me through mutual friends. They make it very comforting to come to Orlando."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",TRISTAN DA SILVA,"I talked with him earlier today, or tonight. I'm super excited, just learning from one of the great coaches. I feel like there's a lot that I can expand my game in, and I can't wait to learn even more. I feel like talking basketball and talking basketball IQ is one of my passions, as well, in the game. I'm just super excited to soak up all that knowledge and kind of grow."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",ISAIAH COLLIER,"It's a blessing being here in the NBA Draft. One of many guys, and I'm just blessed to be in this space."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, I mean, I'm really proud of Steph, happy for Steph. As a freshman, for him to come in and do what he did, help lead that team to another national title, is something very hard to do as a freshman. I love that kid to death. I'm extremely happy for him, and I'll be his biggest fan this year."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it's been a crazy two years, from winning one national title to winning the Big East regular season to the Big East Tournament and then winning another national title. A lot of winning, a lot of succeeding the past two years. I feel like I'm going to keep that chip on my shoulder and go into Portland with just a lot of confidence, with a willingness to learn and get better every single day. I just want to have an impact and try to help this organization win and get to the top and try to win championships."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"I'm really excited. I feel the connection with some of these young guys I've watched since I was in high school. Scoot (Henderson), in particular. I feel like we have a chance to do something really special. I'm young. Having a young team, just growing up around the same age, everyone learning and getting better every day, I'm really excited. I feel like I'm at a loss for words right now. I don't even know what else to say. I'm just excited and extremely blessed for this opportunity, and I'm really ready to get to Portland and get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Being able to space the floor, knock down the three ball, playmake at a high level. I feel like I can handle the ball at the top of the key, pass the ball at a high level and I can shoot the ball at a high level. One thing about me is I want to be a great teammate. I want to be the best teammate. I want to be the best player that Coach wants to coach every day. Coach is happy about coaching him because he gives his all. I want to be that guy. I'm just ready to get to work."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"It's a great feeling. You dream of this moment your whole life. You watch it on TV every single year. To have that moment here in front of you today and to hear my name called is something that I'll remember for the rest of my life. That was a really special moment. Like I said, I'm extremely blessed and grateful for everyone that has helped me to get to this point. I'm ready to get to work and ready to learn and ready to try to impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yes, I just did."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"It was great. I like Coach a lot. When I went out there for my visit, he was a good dude, great dude. The whole staff, the whole organization, you can really tell people that want to learn and want to win and learn and get better. That's something -- that's what I'm about, and I'm really ready to go get going."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,Too young.
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DONOVAN CLINGAN,"Yeah, it just shows that we were the best program in college basketball and they still are right now. Coach Hurley is the best coach in college basketball, and he's producing players at a high level every single year. I'm not sure the exact number of draft picks he's had these past five years, but Coach Hurley has been the top of the top in college for a couple years now. I love that man to death."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"They always told me that they were super high on me. But of course it's the NBA Draft, so you can't make any promises to anybody. I just can't wait to get out there and show my versatility, especially with the kind of talent that we already have on that team. It being the youngest team in the league right now, I feel like our future is pretty bright. I just can't wait to get out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Yeah, definitely. Just being able to show my playmaking ability with such a great teammate like that. And just learning how to play off the ball at UConn, so being able to show that as well, especially with having a great teammate like Victor. Being able to set ball screens for him and cut in space when teams are trying to load up on him. Just trying to use all aspects of my game to just impact winning."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"It's really hard to prepare for that moment. I mean, it's just a lot of emotions running through your head, especially when you hear your name being called. But on the basketball side of things, just always keep your head down, always working. Just staying humble and just having all that self-confidence in myself that everything is going to work out."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"I was just playing for the best coach in college basketball and now flipping to the NBA and going to play for a legendary coach like Coach Pop. It's a blessing. On the culture side of things, it's not really a big culture change from UConn to San Antonio. Just being out there in the pre-draft process, you can tell it's a hardworking program and super hard-nosed. I just can't wait to go out there and just show what I got."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Everything is just happening like really, really fast. Just being in the natty, soaking in that moment with my teammates, that's a super big accomplishment. And flip over to a couple months later and you another one of your teammates are top-10 picks.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"I just talked to him on the phone not too long ago. We were just talking about coming down to San Antonio and just can't wait to get to work, and just excited for our future and excited for this upcoming season."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"It means a lot. Me and D.C. have been through so much together. I was friends with him before I got to UConn, before I committed to UConn. I've known him forever now. I mean, I know how much he's been through. For that to happen, it's such a great reflection on our program and just it's a reflection on all the hard work that we've put in. It's really a blessing."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Nah, he didn't tell me that as soon as I got drafted. That's probably a conversations we'll have a little later."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",STEPHON CASTLE,"Well, I mean, what I picked for the draft, it wasn't intentional. But I guess it all really worked out. I guess I kind of manifested it to happen for me. But I wasn't really expecting anybody (in particular) to pick me. I didn't have any expectations. I was really open-minded to everything. I'm happy that it went the way that it did. I'm super blessed for the Spurs organization taking a chance on me and I just can't wait to get out there."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"Oh, man, just want to thank God first, first and foremost, just for putting me in this position. I was ready to get ready to work. Coming in day one, do all the dirty work we need to do to win. I think I'm a winning player. I'm a win-now type of player, being one of the older guys in the draft. Just having that experience from college, and like I said, just doing all the dirty work, rebounding, diving on the floor for loose balls and just anything we need to do to win."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"I would love to play alongside Malik Monk, De'Aaron Fox, I think we have a great big in Sabonis, probably one of best passers in the NBA from a big standpoint. I'm just ready to be a two-way, versatile player. Get stops on one end, and I can also create some offense not only for myself but my teammates on the other end."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, I did work out for the Kings. Honestly, one of my better workouts, I believe. I think we had a very fantastic meeting with everybody who made the decision to draft me. Just very thankful for that. Me and Coach Brown talked, how we see myself fitting in on the team, and just coach/player talk. I think I got a good feel for Coach and he got a good feel for me. Just ready to start in journey."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"It means everything. Just seeing his face whenever I got drafted, how happy he was, he didn't get a chance to get drafted. So just seeing his face and how excited he was for everything that we've been through, working out, countless hours throughout the night, morning. It's just a very special moment. Came up with handshake today and almost messed it up, but it's all right. We got it done."
2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",DEVIN CARTER,"Yeah, just me being confident, like I said, I know the type of player I am. I know what I bring to the court. I know I just wanted to give Kim the same promise he gave me when he first came to Providence, that he'll make me one of the better players in the conference.

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"It means a lot. Definitely because I would say when I was younger, I wasn't really like that in my area, and to now be sort of that guy that people want to see, especially being from the area and now (back) in the area. It means a lot to finally see all the stuff that I've done come to light."

2024 - NBA DRAFT,"June 26, 2024",BUB CARRINGTON,"I would say the biggest adjustment would be how they game plan. It's real strategic for the league. I'm starting to see that working out for all these different teams. They have a real game plan and strategy going into every single game, and if you don't execute it, you can't play. I feel like that's something I'm going to have to get adjusted to."

Such a blessing to be a part of this roster. They just drive me in so many different ways, from top to bottom. I'm just so thankful and grateful for each and every one of them. They made me a better player and made me a better person. The city of Boston, everything, has just been amazing for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Man, nobody deserves it more. Hell of a career. So underrated career. Just does everything for us. Doesn't ask for anything. I'm so happy for him, and I'm glad I could be a part of it. Just an amazing career, and this is just another chapter of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Man, I love Joe Mazzulla so much. Coming off the year I had, and he gets the job, and he's like, You know what? I'm going to start you. Which I wasn't expecting. He was like, I believe in you and I trust in you. This is going to give you the confidence. And from that moment on, I think it's changed my whole career. I'd do anything for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a great teammate, a great competitor. I was happy for him that he was able to go out there. The crowd cheering him on like that just got him going. He's still 7-4 and can do so many different things here. He's special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It's a surreal feeling. Still has not really kicked in yet. Just trying, I guess, to enjoy the moment. I kept saying, ""Wow."" These last seven years have been a roller coaster, up and down. I had to listen to all the s--- that people said about me, and tonight, it was worth it. Oh, my God."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, maybe getting drafted. That's something that you dream about. But this is at the top of the mountain. To be able to say we did it, that we came together and we won a championship. Banner No. 18 has been hanging over our head for so many years. To know that we're going to be engraved in history, and it still hasn't like registered. I'm just still trying to process it all. But we did it. We won a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"He told me that I was the best in the world. I said, ""You're damn right I am."""
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Say that again.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Please say that again (laughter).
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That it was -- it was -- all the sacrifice was worth it. I'm so thankful to have been in the positions that I was growing up. Thankful for my mom. Thankful for my dad introducing me to basketball. My grandmother who helped raise me. All my friends and family that have supported me, every coach, every teammate that I've had. There's a lot of people that have had a hand in the success of Jayson Tatum. So I guess in this moment, I'm just very thankful for everybody that supported me in the highest of moments and in the lowest of moments. I'm very, very appreciative of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, this is going to be a night that I will remember for the rest of my life, from the game, the celebration, these moments. You know, over the last couple years, we had some tough losses at home in the playoffs. We've lost the NBA Championship at home in front of our fans. We had a chance to beat Miami in Game 6 a few years ago and lost that one. So to have a big win, the biggest win that you could have in front of your home crowd, I felt like that was really important to go out there and do everything in my power to make sure we won this game tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It took being relentless. It took being on the other side of this and losing in the Finals and being at literally the lowest point in a basketball career that you could be, to next year, to the following year, thinking that was going to be the time, and come up short again. So, I mean, people have said it before. But coming up short and having failures makes this moment that much better. Because you know what it feels like to lose. You know what it feels like to be on the other side of this and be in the locker room and hearing the other team celebrating, hearing them celebrate on your home floor. That was devastating. And now, to elevate yourself in a space that, you know, all your favorite players are in, everybody that they consider greats or legends have won a championship, and all of the guys I looked up to won a championship, multiple championships. So now I can, like, walk in those rooms and be a part of that. It's a hell of a feeling. This is more -- I dreamed about what it would be like, but this is 10 times better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"First of all, congrats to him. Well-deserved. Extremely happy for him. This is a hell of an accomplishment. The main goal for us was to win a championship. We weren't -- we didn't care who got Finals MVP. I know that I need him through this journey and he needs me. So, you know, it was great to see him have that moment and share that moment with him. I'm extremely happy for him. Well-deserved. That was big-time. He earned that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Man, from day one when I came in, my mindset was I'm going to give everything to this team and this city to try to win a championship here because I knew these guys have already been so close. Yeah, once I got hurt, it was a heartbreaking moment for me. I didn't want to accept the truth. It was like, no way it happened, right. But, yeah, tonight was the night. I was like, listen, I'm going to give it everything I have. And, yeah, I'm just super happy to be a part of this and give something to the team, and I'm super thankful for the support I've gotten from the fans. And tonight the arena was electric. It's been unbelievable playing in front of these fans."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know what, like since last game, I've been thinking about, like, how can I get my body ready for next game. Like, no matter how it is. And today I was like, I'm going to try everything possible to get out there. So from this morning, I was preparing myself that I will go out there. And, yeah, the medical staff was, like, unbelievable support for me and got me back out there somehow. And, man, I'm super thankful for them. And, yeah, I gave everything I could. I gave everything I could. And, man, it feels great to be a champion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, we have like a super-composed team. We don't have any like, loud, like, guys. Like, we're super confident but also, like, down-to-earth people in this organization and in this roster. Everybody had the mindset of, like, we are going to do whatever it takes, each of us individually, to get the job done. Like, we want to win a championship for this city. And everything, you know -- we did everything possible for that, and now we get the fruits from our labor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, finally, finally, man. It was a long road to get here, to be honest. To be the last team standing, it feels amazing. Like, all that work paid off. As I said, when I was still on stage and stuff, like it still felt surreal. Like, I couldn't -- and us as a team, I think we couldn't really, like, settle into that. But then once we got back to the locker room and started celebrating, I think that's when everybody realized we actually did it. We did it. And, yeah, Joe is an animal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I know, great question. Al is an unbelievable teammate, unbelievable person. Everybody loves him. He's a great leader. You know, knowing how he has been chasing this for so long in his career and finally get it done, and playing at a high, high level at his age, man, I don't even know, like, words I could use to describe him. You know, everybody loves him. And he gave everything to this team. He deserves it more than anybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No. (Laughter). No, obviously, like, what was put out, it was the truth. It was, like, something torn. And then my tendon is just out of place. And it, like, pretty much hurts on every step. Like, I would take a walk in Dallas, and my leg would swell up. I was like, I don't know how I'm going to play, if I'm going to play. But my mindset was always, I'm going to try to find a way how I can manage this. And, yeah, somehow I got it going for this game. A lot of it was for sure like the adrenaline from just playing at the Garden and playing in front of our fans and having that opportunity to close it out. And, man, I got it going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Good question. I don't know how to answer it yet, to be honest. I think I'm going to need a little bit of time, and then I can kind of reflect. Because right now I'm just so in the moment and enjoying this. Man, this team, like, you know, it's just a special team and, like, everybody gave whatever they could for us to get here. And right now, we are just so in the moment. I think once I'm back home and settled, everything settles, I'll be able to compare better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's available. Expect to see him tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Have faith and execute what's necessary to win Game 5.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yes.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it wasn't necessarily Game 4. It was the time after Game 3 leading up to our time together yesterday. So, I think it's just kind of getting the general temperature of the team. Kind of figuring out where we're at. And, you know, regardless of where we are at, the series, you always have small resets like that throughout anything. So thought that was just kind of the temperature of our team and making sure we are in the proper space to be ready to execute."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,No.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It feels good. I think the most important thing, something that's really been going through my mind throughout this process, is you can't lose sight of the people that came before us. And I want to make sure every person that's worked for the Celtics, that's played for the Celtics that didn't win, knows that their work and what they have done has not gone unnoticed or it doesn't play a part in where we are at today. It can be so easy when you work for this organization and you don't win that the work that people put in just gets brushed over or gets ignored. And when I first got here, the staff, you know, Brad's coaching, the staff that they had, the foundation that they built with these guys when they were young, the foundation of what we have, is one of the reasons why we're here today. So I think that's one of the first things that came to mind, was just because we won this doesn't mean what the people have done before us isn't just as important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Oh, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yes. Payton is one of the best competitors and one of my favorite people in the world. Just the way he competes, the professionalism and just for his ability to take pride in stuff like that. He's really grown as a player this year to becoming a well-rounded player on both ends of the floor, and he won us games. I think he won us moments. You know, as the playoffs go on, obviously some patterns change and things change, but those guys have to win moments of games for you, and Payton did that twice for us. That is just as important as any other plays that happened throughout the series and in the playoffs alone. You know, I've got a huge heart for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It really starts with them. You can't have a philosophy or a way of playing if you don't have a group of guys that are willing to buy into it and be disciplined. Quite honestly, this group of guys has been through so much in the league, they know what it takes. It's more about that. When you have a group of guys that have an understanding of what it takes, using the experiences that you've been through. And that, to me, is more than anything. It was a joy watching the guys just grow as a team throughout the year but also like really work at it. Like, there's a group of guys in the locker room that decided they wanted to win day one, and credit to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"That was awesome. It's a huge credit to him. Like I said, I know he's been in and out in the playoffs, but he's worked his ass off to try and get in and play as much as he could. It just says -- about the team, everyone is going to do whatever it takes to win. And even though he wasn't a hundred percent, he said he wanted to play, and he knew he could give us something. And I thought that the minutes he gave us were valuable. It speaks to who he is, and it speaks to the locker room."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, those were actual numbers. We live in an expected world. So we didn't pay much attention to the actual numbers. But to me it was just paying attention more to the process of what we were doing. And there were obviously some things that we had to improve upon from last year analytically to make up for some of the stuff that we lost. The guys bought into that. So to me, it was just more of the process of making sure that we are playing the right way, making sure, you know, we are attacking the game analytically in the right way, but also having the open-mindedness and discipline to do some of the other stuff. So I thought it was a good balance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like it's going to be like that for the rest of my career, as it should be. I think just having an understanding that praise and criticism are both just as dangerous. And if you don't handle them well, and I think we talked about that as a team this year, like winning is just as dangerous as losing if you don't handle it well. I think our guys handled winning the right way by, whether we won or lost, we just moved on to the next game. And it's Boston. Like, we wouldn't want it any other way. I think the ownership and the responsibility to give back to the franchise, give back to the city, that's just part of it. And so I think -- but you need it. Like, you need that. You need criticism. You need praise. You need expectations. All those things go into making who you are as a person, making who you are as people, as an organization. So just having an understanding that they are never going to go away. If someone tells you ""Good job,"" that's just as dangerous as someone telling you you suck. But you need both of them in order to get to where you want to get to, and there's no place else I'd rather be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,They shoot the ball a lot. I mean they are good. They are really good. That number is incredible when you think about it. But it works. And so we're going to need to add to that point total tonight if we want to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's a balance. You know, there's communication. There's always development with one's individual game. And so it's almost going to be a year since we had him in the draft. I think the draft is in nine or 10 days. And so to be able to see where he has improved, not just in his strength but also the other areas, and he can shoot. You know, he has the ability. He has a nice stroke out beyond the arc. And so in due time, he will be one that's going to probably shoot a lot of threes. But right now, his strength is offensive rebounding, the vertical game, and then defense, being able to guard the ball and then also protect the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, those have been games that we've looked at as games that can change a series. And so just understanding swing games, when you look at 3 and 5, are typically the swing games. So we really have had success in Game 5s, and hopefully that will continue tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we expected him back at some point, and he's available tonight. What does it change? Just, you know, his ability to score in Game 1 and 2, and we have to be better. We've got to make him put it on the floor where he just can't catch-and-shoot. Then defensively, we have to be aware of his shot blocking. And so we've got to account for him when we do drive it to the paint that he's one that can change or block shots, and we have to be better at that. In Game 1 and 2, we weren't very good. With him on the floor, we'll see how he moves, but I think that healthy or not healthy -- I mean, healthy, we are going to still check to see how he moves. So nothing changes there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we're going to fight. We put ourselves in a position in Game 4 to get a win to keep the series going, and now we're here in Boston. They have played extremely well at home. But we still feel that the pressure is on them to end the series. For us, it's to go out there and play. Hopefully we can copy some of the things we did in Game 4 to have success and hopefully can put ourselves in a position tonight to win. But, you know, as we've always said in this league, it's hard to close the door. Nothing's given. You've got to earn it. And so for tonight, we've got to find a way to keep this thing going and get it back to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"He's a superstar. He's one of the best players in the world. Most stars love that type of atmosphere, that type of setting. That's what makes them stars is they tend to bring their best game with their back against the wall. He's done it for the Mavs and for his national team, and so we expect nothing any less than that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I knew about the Red Sox and Yankees. You know, when you talk about being down 3-0, that's the truth and those are the facts. But there is another game to be played, and so if you can just stay in the present, that can help, you know, with what you're trying to achieve, and that's to keep the series going, and we did that in Game 4. Here on the road, we have to be in the present. We can't think about Game 6 or Game 4. We have to play Game 5. So we are excited about having this opportunity, and hopefully we can put our best foot forward to keep this thing going."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their journey for seven years, there's been ups, there's been learning experiences for them with winning and losing, and so understanding for us, we've been together for five months, some of us, so this is a really positive journey that we've been on here, and we'll look at what we can do as we get to the Finals, just understanding we have to play our best basketball. Unfortunately, Boston was better than us in this series and they won the championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we had some great looks there that just didn't go down for us. Ky has a layup that rims in and out. P.J. had great looks. It just wasn't our night offensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the first step is just to be in it. I think that's a big thing. A lot of us -- when I say a lot of us, excluding the people in the locker room, didn't have us here, and so to be able to start the playoffs in L.A., to start the playoffs in Oklahoma, to start the playoffs in Minnesota, to understand that that's not easy to do. I thought the group did a great job. Yes, we lost 4-1, but I thought the group fought against the Celtics and just, unfortunately, we just couldn't make shots when we had to, or we turned the ball over and they took full advantage of that. So there's a lot of positives in this run that we were on during the playoffs, but also, since March, we've been playing basketball at a high level. So when we go back to look at some of the stuff, what we can continue to build on and what we can get better at."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a very good point. First year we lose to Golden State, who becomes the world champs, then we lose this year to the World Champs in the Boston Celtics. So, not a bad run in two out of three years. So, in between those two years, we get D-Live and we get trades that makes the team better, so a lot of positive things. We're a young team, and so this isn't a team when you look at, you know, do we have to replace some of the older players, it's -- you know, we have a core, a young core at that, and so this is an exciting time to be a Mavs fan and to also be a coach for the Mavs."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, he's one of the best players in the world, and so I think the biggest thing for him is that we all would like to be healthy, but there's going to be bumps and bruises along the way. So, for him at the age of 25 to get to the Finals, to be playing his basketball at the level that he's playing is, now it's just being consistent, and I think we all would say he led the league in scoring. He also has won, so now it's just a matter of being consistent and, again, always being in the talk for MVP because when you have one of the best players in the world, you should be always fighting for a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's just time, being able to go through it, to get to know each other a little bit better on the court and off the court. So, I think the more time that these guys are around each other the better they're going to be next year. Again, five months without a training camp. This season started in Abu Dhabi and it's been going on for a long time. So for this group to spend time together, to fail, and to understand what it feels like to fail and also to see what failure is and then how do we get better and learn from that. I think I've got a great group of young men who will be hungry this summer and will come back ready to play at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it snowballed quickly. The turnovers led to easy baskets or wide-open threes. So they took advantage of that, and we couldn't keep scoring or keep pace with them. We got good looks that just didn't go down for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Very confident. I mean, that's a positive note that we can take from this series, just how far we made it and how proud I am of the guys. We answered a lot of questions this year on what we were capable of doing and now it's just about being consistent. I think probably in the last week, I said that I wanted to be remembered as one of the best teams of this era and our last few champions have been a new one each and every year. So, I see an opportunity for us to really build our future in a positive manner where this is almost like a regular thing for us, and we're competing for championships. You know, I think from a spiritual standpoint, I think I enjoyed this journey more than any other season, just because of the redemption arc and being able to learn as much as I did about myself and my teammates and the organization and the people that I'm around. It's a lot of good people here so it makes coming to work a lot of fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, it starts in the summertime, it starts early in preseason when you're developing your habits. I think we went 0-4 in preseason to start, which wasn't the best start. But we got off to a pretty decent start to the season and there was some injuries and some uncontrollable things that happened, but I think if you look at the overall big picture, Luka's right, and I've been saying it too, just failure, it can inspire you beyond measure. We started off as a fifth seed and started on the road in every series and we were able to accomplish this and we were able to grow as teammates and a brotherhood here, a sisterhood here, where we can really take that as a positive going into the summer. So, yeah, failing at this stage definitely sucks. It's a bitter feeling because you want to keep playing and you feel like your best game is coming up next and the shots that you shoot next game are coming up, and now we got to wait two and a half months, three and a half months so the new champion gets a chance. So, yeah, I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to grow with these guys in this locker room. Everybody across our organization, we've been able to celebrate our wins, but also learn how to celebrate our losses too and how to grow from that. So that's the difficult part of being human. When you really love something you really want to win and it doesn't happen, how do you respond from that. So I think that's where we are now, but I think I could tell you I'm pretty confident that we'll be back in the gym pretty soon and getting ready for next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it was emotional anyway. I mean, every series was emotional, just because I was just uncertain on how it was going to go and how we were going to respond to a little bit of adversity. We finally ran into a team where they beat us fair and square, and we weren't able to respond to a lot of their runs and we weren't able to execute at a high level. So when I was shaking everybody's hands, that was more of a sign of respect for their journey. They have been through an incredible five-year span of going to Game 7s or losing in the Finals, so they know what this bitter feeling feels like being up here answer answering questions about when this next year holds and I think they used everything as motivation. They were healthy, and they really kept their head down and weren't paying attention to any of the personal accolades or individual accolades. I think they just came together as a team and were okay with each person being great in their role and selflessly putting their best foot forward. So I think we learned more than anything from this series on what it takes to not only get back to this level, but win at this level, and the Celtics are the perfect example for us this season because of how much they have had to deal with in the past few years. So, it's admirable, you know, and to see -- did JB win Finals MVP? Yeah, that was big-time to see that trophy in his hands. I think him and JT should have split it, but those two guys in particular have, you know, almost been like students and as well now becoming teachers in their own right. So to see them accomplish -- see them accomplish that, I'm really proud and also extremely motivated to get back to this position in the next few years with my guys and be able to win this thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, basketball is a game of centimeters, man, sometimes inches, so when a ball is flying off your hands, sometimes it's going to feel good, sometimes it isn't. That's the maturity aspect. You got to move on to the next thing, and I've been talking about that. Whether I'm playing well specifically scoring-wise or I'm not, there is a team aspect here that we're becoming more gelled into or dialed into. I can score 25 points, but if I don't, we got to be able to pick each other up, and I think that's what we're learning about each other now, where they're going to be games where the shooting is not going to go well particularly for me or someone else on the team, and that's where we have to galvanize as a group and other players make plays and opportunities created for one another. I've been at the point of attack through most of my drives going against the Celtics one-on-one or coming off screens. So that's what the summer is for, is just continuing to work on those things that I saw this year, the physicality, being able to adjust to it and by next year be in a better position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would agree with that. Yeah, just time together means a lot, and failing together is not the ideal situation, but from a leadership standpoint, going through situations like that sometimes it will motivate you beyond things that you could imagine. When I was a little bit younger and I was injured in 2015 and we lost, it was a team loss. It wasn't just I was injured and we could have done this or that. So that went on my Finals record. I was 0-1. The next year we came back and won in a 3-1 comeback, and then the following year we lost against the Warriors and I haven't been back since. So, I look at it as, you know, an opportunity for us to observe what we did well this year as a group and how me and Luka can be better as the leaders of the team, one of -- a few of the leaders on the team, and really just enjoy the ups and downs of what's coming because now we know what to expect. So, this past year was a lot of newness. It was a lot of people being in new positions in terms of just the success. Success can be new for a lot of people too, but when you fail at the Finals, it's not something that you want to carry the disappointment forever or on to next season. We worked extremely hard to be one of the final two teams. We didn't achieve our goal, but we achieved most of our goal. So, this is just the last step that we have to get back to, and we know it's not going to be easy. We're going to be going against a lot of young teams that are emerging, but we're going to get better as well, and I think this experience will carry us forth in the following series that we play next year. God willing we make it back to the playoffs and get the chance to play our best basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it's easy to get to that point when you have no other choice but to look at your partner or your teammates and say that we're going to do this and we're going to accomplish it, no matter what anyone says. The hardest thing, I would say one of the most difficult things, not the hardest thing, but one of the most difficult things in this industry is, as I've been here for 12 years, is dealing with a lot of the relationship with, sort of say, social media or fans and media, and then us as players and wanting to achieve a golden legacy, so to say. Everybody looks at MJ as the prototypical guy, he was 6-0. Then you go down the list to Bill Russell and other great guys that have come through this league -- I could name a myriad of names, but for those guys in particular I think they have had the same trajectory or career path as some of the greatest to play the game, where they have lost early in their career and now they're at the top of the mountain because they earned their way there and they have been able to learn. So, again, I'm nothing short of proud of those guys, but I think this was a message to my teammates as well, that when we get this opportunity, God willing we get this opportunity again, we work hard, it's going to be more than just our talent that's going to get us over that edge. It's going to be more than just somebody scoring 30. It's going to take more than just scoring, it's going to take everything from you. That's what makes this thing beautiful too is, when you get to the top of that mountain, how do you stay motivated there. Now that they're there I think those are questions they're going to have to answer for themselves. But for us, we got to the top of the mountain and we failed, so now we have to start at the bottom, and that should be inspiring. So, grateful that I love what I do, grateful that I get to do it with people that love what they do too. So it will be a long summer, but looking forward to the start of next season now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm so grateful. I know I've said it before, but it's glory to the Lord for putting me in this position. It's been a lot of years. I don't think it's sunk in yet. I'm going through the emotions right now, but I don't feel like it's over. This is an unbelievable feeling. Yeah, the confetti, everything is going on, but it just hasn't hit me yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Wow. It was crazy because during free agency meetings in 2016, my agent and I, Jason Glushon, were both sitting in the meeting, and we just kept looking at this enormous ring in Wyc’s hand. And after the meeting we were like, Did you notice that? That's the attention. Man, I never forget what Danny Ainge told me in that meeting. He said, ""You can win championships in many places, but there's nothing like winning in Boston. Nothing like winning as a Celtic."" And that stuck with me from that meeting. I was like, man, I'm trying to be great, and that's what I want. The fact that it has come, it has happened, JT, JB, stepping up in a big way and leading us, it's special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, no question. You know, we all know Joe was thrown into the fire last year, and I felt like he did the best he could. But I just think this year, everything was different when we came in for workouts before training camp. He really, I felt like, put a sprint on everything how he wanted it to be and how he wanted us to work, how he wanted us to carry ourselves and how determined he wanted us to be. And it started from there. That energy that he had translated to the assistant coaches, to us, to the training staff, everybody, and we just kind of follow suit. I feel like this type of team is Joe Mazzulla ball. It's defending, being gritty on offense. It's being able to -- everybody be a threat on the court at the same time. And everything that he wanted to do, he was able to accomplish. He always knew when to push the buttons. He's hard. He can be a little whacky sometimes. But that's what we appreciate about him. He truly cares about us, and he cares about what it means to be a Celtic."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, the first thing you have to do when you come here is you have to embrace that pressure. And I was okay with being in that position. I was okay if we were getting criticized and we weren't getting it done because I understood what it means playing here. And to your point, finally overcoming that and winning and putting ourselves with the greats, this is special. Our group, we've had a lot of hardships the last few years. Last year, heartbreaker against Miami, Game 7. Year before, Golden State. It's been building up. But this team has been resilient, and we've continued to work. I'm so proud of Jaylen, and I'm so proud of Jayson. Those two guys continue to take steps forward. People all year criticizing them, all that expectation, all the pressure. They did it. And they've done it at a young age. They led our group. I'm just very proud of those guys and to put everything aside and focus on winning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Man, that was beautiful. That was beautiful. He did that, and you take a glance at the other team, and it's one of those that breaks your spirit, and then it just kind of fueled us. But Payton, man, that just sums it up. It was ups and downs for him, not knowing what to expect, when to play, when not to play. He's the kind of guy that he is a big-time player, and it's hard because we have a lot of guys. But man, him stepping up, cold, ready, not afraid of the moment, taking the shot; and man, as soon as he shot it, like I don't know how you guys saw it, but I was like, man, he's about to knock it down. Like this is crazy. So, man, the fact that he knocked it down, like that was huge. That was special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I feel like it was impressive. I feel like what people expected us to do or doubted us to do, we did. So shout out to this team and this organization. We did it together, and that was the only way that we could do it was together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, that we did it together. I hope that when people watch us play, they see the joy that we play with, that we love playing together, and we got it done together. I feel like that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's crazy to look back. Before I was trying not to make that happen, and then obviously once I became his teammate, it was like one of the ultimate goals of this season. Knowing the type of person that Al is, knowing the leader that he is, even off the court, the father that he is, just the all-around great person and great human, I'd run through a brick wall for him. I'm so happy that he got one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. It doesn't. Winning's always great. When you do it with people that you love to do it with, it feels great. When you see your teammates celebrating and jumping on each other and throwing champagne, there's nothing like it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's been a journey, you know. I think just being able to, I don't know, maybe reflect on it right now, it's crazy. It seemed like it was yesterday, sitting there with Wyc and him introducing me and just kind of handing me the jersey and everything. And then fast-forward to now, it's like insane. But I'm blessed to be here, and I'm so happy to be here and I'm so happy Brad gave me that call to come through, and JT texting me, hitting me up, talking about ""Come on, Champ."" It's been a hell of a journey."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I think I've spoken on this plenty of times, but they get scrutinized so much and they get so much pressure put on them for not winning or making it to the Eastern Conference Finals eight years in a row, or even making it to the Finals and not getting over that hump. But I feel like people finally see the relationship that they have. They see that from the beginning, they have always done it together. They have never compared against each other. They have always been joyful and happy for each other. So it's been great to experience on this side, and to be on this side and get this win, hopefully it's a burden off of their shoulders. But another burden is doing it again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"He's done a great job. He's definitely elevated my game. Had me look kind of outside of myself and bring something different, you know. On previous teams where maybe I had to score more or handle the ball more, here it was more about being available and knocking down corner threes and rebounding. Doing things that help this team because of the talent that we have. You know, he really opened my eyes to that and from the beginning really just made it known that whatever it takes, as long as it takes, we've got to get it done, and I'm not the only one on this team sacrificing. Everybody on this team sacrificed something."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they just -- they came out aggressive, man. They were good defensively. They're a great defensive team. Respect to them and respect to the coaches for their defensive scheme."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, it's been a hell of a year. I love these guys, man. Like, I mean, we put this team -- you know, with trades and everything was five months ago and to see the growth as a team, and it's different. You know, like -- I don't know. There's a lot of international guys and we don't always have family around and to be able to build a bond like this and to call the team family, it's awesome. To be able to do that in such a short amount of time is -- it's amazing. So obviously, we didn't get what we wanted, but I'm proud and everyone else is very proud of the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, I think, yeah, it's fun when everything -- yeah. 1 through 15, man, like I couldn't -- like, best teammates. They're all great guys in all their individual ways. So, I mean, yeah, by far, man, it always makes your job a lot better when you have fun every day and to call those guys my teammates, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"We got here and I think everyone's hungry now. Obviously, we didn't get where we wanted to, but it's not the end of the world. We know that we need to regroup and be back here again next year. That's the goal every single year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, Kyrie does a great job and he's done a great job from the moment he's got here of being a leader and being someone for younger guys, but also for everyone on the team. So, I mean, obviously it is what it is. The crowds can chant whatever they want to chant. When we're away, they're obviously going to go against us. He does a great job of not letting it affect him and I think that goes back to his leadership on and off the court. So we have nothing but respect for Kyrie and we're not expecting the Celtics to be with us. We're opposing them. So whatever they say is whatever they say. But we all got his back, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Just maybe just physicality, coming out a little stronger or whatnot. But, I don't know, I really haven't thought about it too much. I don't know. My head's all over the place right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I don't know. I just wanted to leave it all on the floor tonight. I try to play every game like it's my last. But, I mean, individual, like it doesn't really matter at this stage. I really just want to win. Yeah, I don't know. We just didn't win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Nothing. Sad we lost. No specific.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"It doesn't matter if I was hurt, how much was I hurt. I was out there. I tried to play, but I didn't do enough."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I feel great. We did some great moves. I would say we've been together for five months. I'm proud of every guy that stepped on the floor, all the coaches, all the people behind. Obviously, we didn't win Finals, but we did have a hell of a season and I'm proud of every one of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,They were physical a lot. They have great defenders.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Just everything. They're a great team. That's what they do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't want to talk about what's next, man. I have some decisions to make. I'm just trying to get a little bit healthier. We'll talk -- we have interviews in two days, right? So I'll give you an answer then."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Right now, I don't really know. That's not what I'm thinking. But they're a great team. They have been together for a long time, and they had to go through everything, so we just got to look at them, see how they play, maturity, and they have some great players. We can learn from that. We got to fight next season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just stay together, man. I think just having Ky on my team -- I mean, on our team, he's unbelievable. Just help him. We said, We'll fight together next season, and we just going to believe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"To be honest, I can't even put it into words. Just Bill Russell and what he's meant for me through my Boston journey, and his spirit. You know, everything that he stood for, just for this to be the Bill Russell MVP Award, it just -- I've got nothing, man. I don't even know what to say. It's unreal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we learned. I think we learned from all of our mistakes. All of our adversity has made us stronger, made us tougher. All season you could see it. We started from the jump. We made all the sacrifices. We played both ends of the ball at a high level. We didn't skip any steps. And this was the result. But all of those experiences, like, led to here. All of moments where we came up short, we felt like we let the city down, let ourselves down, all of that compiled is how we get to this moment. And it makes it feel even that much better that we had to go through all the journey, the heartbreak, the embarrassment, the loss, to get to the mountaintop. It's great. And shout out to all the supporters and the city of Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't even put into words the emotions. It's just I'm blessed and I'm grateful. This was a full team effort. We had a great team. My teammates were great. They allowed me to lead us on both ends of ball, and we just came out and performed on our home floor. It's just amazing. You know, it could have gone to anybody. It could have gone to Jayson. Jayson, like I can't talk enough about his selflessness. You know, I can't talk enough about his attitude. It's just how he approached not just this series or the Finals but just the playoffs in general. And we did it together as a team, and that was the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just our growth together. We've been through a lot. We've been playing together for seven years now. We've been through a lot, the losses, the expectations. The media have said all different types of things: We can't play together, we are never going to win. We heard it all. But we just blocked it out, and we just kept going. I trusted him. He trusted me. And we did it together. To get to this point and share that experience with JT is just awesome, you know what I mean? It's amazing, and it feels great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"If you would have asked me that maybe a year ago, I would probably say yeah. But just at the point I got to right now, it feels great. But any of the personal awards, it is what it is. Yeah, the doubters, they may be quiet now, but they will be back. They will be back next year with something to say. I'll embrace that moment the same and get after it yet again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,Golden Bears.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I can't. I can't. I absolutely can't, man. Just the story and the journey is awesome. You know, just being drafted here in Boston, like a lot of the people probably didn't watch me play in the Pac-12 at Cal. You know, it led to a lot of people feeling a way about that. And, you know, I just came in and kept my head down and told myself, I'm going to just keep working. And, you know, to be here in this moment now, through all the years, through all the doubt, through all of the ups and downs, through all of the verdicts, through all of the everything, it just makes the story that much sweeter. But I can't even put it into words. Like, it just feels great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, nobody deserved it more than Al. He's been a great not just leader on the court but off the court as well. Just a mentor. Somebody I know I can talk to about life and is going to give me great advice about family, about finances, about just life, adversity, whatever the case is. Just Al has just been that guy for me and for us. Like just his performance all season long, like Al is 37, 38 years old, and we leaned on him so much. Probably too much for his age and where he's at. He just delivered. So consistent, so disciplined with his body. Never complains, you know what I mean. The only thing he does is add to winning. For him, great teammate. It's been an honor to be by his side. And Al Horford is a real-life legend and hero. It's been great to be his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we have an opportunity. I think we definitely have a window. We take it one day at a time. We definitely have to make sure we stay healthy. But, you know, we'll enjoy the summer, enjoy the moment, and then we get right back to it next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, it still kind of feels unreal. It feels like there's another game or something tomorrow. But, you know, I can't tell you enough about our group and our coaching staff. They were great all season long. They prepared us for these moments. We had an excellent game plan in the Finals, and then all of the guys contributed. Like, for example, like Payton Pritchard, like unreal, right. Unreal. Like just comes in the game and drains one from halfcourt. That dude, he's a f---ing legend, man. Shout out to Payton Pritchard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 17, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It means a lot. I wish my grandmother was here with me to see this moment. But I woke up from my pregame nap, and I had a dream, and my grandma was in the dream, and she gave me a hug this afternoon. I just knew everything was going to be all right. But I wish she could be here. But she was so important and pivotal in my life. And it's just awesome. I know she would be proud of me. Grandma, I know she was watching, and I love you so much."

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I don't know about celebrate, but it's been a nice, relaxing day. Spent some time with the kids. My dad is in town and spent time with him. Just try and enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Try to move on. I mean, that's what the playoffs is all about, win or loss, you've got to move on from it. You've got to learn from it. You understand that you've got to play better than obviously Game 4. Every game gets more difficult, so we just have to be locked into our game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,We're going to be ready to go. We've bounced back all year. I just think the Garden is going to be electric. It's going to be a lot of fun. I'm just looking forward to it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We've been lucky enough to have a lot of the past champions here, and just seeing their presence. I just think that when it gets tough, and obviously it's going to get tough. We've just got to stick together. We've got to believe in one another, and we've been doing that all year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"For us? I would say we're a confident group. I just think you've got to stick together. There's going to be ups, and there's going to be downs. And, I mean, if someone is struggling or whatever, you have to pick them up, and that's the type of team we have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Obviously you just look at the rebounding numbers, that tells you a lot about what happened in that game. Just get back to five guys crashing the paint and just trying to get every rebound."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't look at it as pressure. I do notice, especially this time of the season, playoff time and obviously being in the Finals for the second time. When you drive around and go to the gas station, or I wanted to go get some ice cream yesterday, it's Celtics gear everywhere and everybody is super excited about this team and what we have accomplished and what we have the chance to accomplish. You really just feel the love and support from everybody in the city of Boston, and how bad they want us to win, how much they have been cheering for us. So I don't look at it as pressure. Just unconditional support, and that we have an amazing fan base here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It did take some time. For one, normally, when you're a top five draft pick, you go to a lottery team that is rebuilding. I was in a unique situation from the rest of the guys in my draft class in that the Celtics were the No. 1 seed in the East before. We were competing for a championship ever since I've gotten here. It brings me back to my earlier years. I would talk to guys in my draft class, and they were losing 15 games in a row. And me, I'm fighting for the 1 seed, and I'm on a veteran team that's trying to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I would say just throughout that season. I had no idea who Cedric Maxwell was. I thought he was just like a radio guy (laughter). I didn't know that he played on the team, and he won Finals MVP. So there were just different instances throughout the season in my rookie year where I would learn about different people that played an intricate part in this organization -- the history throughout the Celtics and what the Celtics mean to the game of basketball. You just grow a level of appreciation through your time here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. When I found out that I was going to be a dad, I was still in college. I had like a week or two left. I wasn't ecstatic. I was a little selfish at that point because I knew that I was about to go chase my dream and be in the NBA. I felt like that was going to affect what people thought of me, affect where I went in the draft. So I'd be the first to say I wasn't like super thrilled to find out I was going to be a dad, and quickly realized that it was like the best thing that ever could have happened to me. There's nothing better than being a dad. I think, especially for me and my first year in the NBA at 19, it taught me a sense of responsibility. Because it's tough, being 19 years old and coming into fame and this newfound fortune. Nobody can, I guess, help you or prepare you for what it's like to be 19 and have millions of dollars. And I think -- not that I think. I know that having Deuce at that age grounded me. Because whatever decision I wanted to make, I had to make sure that he was taken care of. I couldn't just up and go or do everything that some of my peers were doing because I had to go home and put him to bed. Or for Father's Day weekend I was going out of town or -- I had to skip out on this trip with my friends because it was my weekend with him. Not that it's a sacrifice. I willingly would choose those things. But it has taught me a sense of responsibility, as well as just making the right decisions. Knowing that there's a six-year-old mini me essentially watching everything that I do and knowing that I have to be the best version of myself. I have to make the right decisions because he's always watching."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think after Game 4, he just reminded us to have fun. We wanted to go for the kill, essentially, and we wanted to win so bad that maybe we got away from what makes us special and what makes us the Boston Celtics. Today, just reminded each guy why he's important to this team and why we all need each other and what a person brings to the table. I think that was really important for us to go over today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't think we came out and expected that we were going to come out and roll over on it and win. I firmly believe we had the right intentions. We wanted to win. We wanted to play the right way. That moment -- we wanted that moment. But I think we maybe put too much pressure on ourselves at that moment to be perfect or think it was going to go how we wanted it to go. Joe did a great job today of reminding us that it's okay to smile during wars. It's okay to have fun during high-pressure moments. That's what makes our team unique and special. We would love to win tomorrow, more than anything. But if it doesn't happen, it's not the end of the world. We have more opportunities. So just setting that table of don't surrender to that idea that we have to win tomorrow. We would love to, absolutely. But Game 5 is the biggest game of the season because it's the next game on the schedule. So going with that mindset, and just have fun. That's really what we talked about today. Get back to having fun and being a team and how special we are and the team that got us here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Very excited. We're excited to come out here and compete and try to get this W.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"We came back Saturday morning. It was a nice flight. We already moved on from it. There's no reason to dwell on it. Get ready for Game 5 and try to get the W. The flight was good. We got together as a team, enjoyed it and get ready."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It would be huge to win this next game. We really want to win the next game. But if we don't, it's not the end of the world. We have three more rounds to go, at (most). But the most important game is the next one, and to do it in front of the home crowd would be special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I'm expecting it to be rowdy. Definitely a crazy, crazy atmosphere. Looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just shows that teams are capable of coming back from that. If you get hot, you can win four games in a row. So understanding that, and knowing that every game we've got to bring everything we've got. It's going to take 48 minutes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player. He's somebody we care for deeply and gives us a great boost. Him as a person, just being there is huge for us. We are lucky to have him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He definitely wants to play. He's a really big competitor, and I know he's going to do everything in his power to get out there and put on that uniform with his teammates."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They just beat us in every category possible: 50/50 balls, rebounding, shooting, defensively. It's like one of those games, you just scrap and look forward to the next one because they beat us fair and square."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"That will never happen if you don't run back on defense, rebound, execute and get to your spacing. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I haven't talked to him yet. Going to talk about that before we start at 2:00. So I'm not sure kind of where he's at. But he's trying and doing everything he can to try to put himself in position to be out there. I know that for sure.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"You're just made by all the experiences and things that you have. Regardless of what I am, what I'm made from, first and foremost, my identity, Christ is the most important thing before all that. And after that, it's about winning for the Boston Celtics and the process of winning -- getting back on defense, playing hard, transition, rebounding, spacing, execution. Those things are the most important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It's a good question. Multiple layers to that. Obviously it's game plan, execution, and that can change once the game begins. One side of the ball is heavily dictated by the other. I think one of the things that we've freed our minds to this year is just making reads and having an understanding, having a spatial awareness about who is where, what's the spacing, what's the attack and just being able to make plays on both ends of the floor there. So there's definitely obviously a game plan component. You have to have a plan going into it. But at the end of the day, it's the individual pride, and then it's the instincts from the guy when they are out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, every game, regardless of how it goes, there's always stuff that you can learn from and there's always stuff that you don't learn from. Regardless, I think the most important thing is our process toward getting better has been the same whether we have won or lost, whether we have won big or lost big. We have always tried to find the 10 or 12 possessions we can get better at and find the things we did pretty well and how can we do those more. I just kept a consistent process toward our postgame retrieval, and then how we grow with that heading into the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"When they are at their best, the team that dictates the pace dictates kind of the momentum and the opportunities. So yeah, I think that's definitely part of it, is how can we dictate the pace of the game and how can we dictate the momentum of the game. You can do that in different ways. Transition is obviously one of those, but there's other ways you can do that as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, it just depends. I think they played a well-balanced offensive game from everybody. The game is connected, and so if you are not doing one thing well, going to something different may not always stop that. Just have to be open-minded. Every game takes on a life of its own. We have the things that we can control and then we have the things that we have to be ready to adjust to kind of depending upon how the game goes over the course of time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just a guy defined by the ability to make plays on both ends. Like you said, mistakes don't weigh him down. Doesn't matter if he misses a shot or makes a mistake on the defensive end. Just has the ability to make plays and he can do them on both ends of the floor. That balance of impacting the game in different ways is crucial for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Thank you.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, definitely. I think some of our defensive struggles came from our offensive struggles, no question, and vice versa. There's definitely some things we need to do better on the offensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We just take it as -- being together, in film and just understanding the flow of the game. But even before the game, Coach Kidd said, I hope you packed your bags because we are going to Boston. Just having that mentality of doing whatever it takes. We've definitely been changing our ID from playing free to playing desperate. Doing whatever we can to get a bucket or get a stop. That energy, that focus is going to propel us into transition buckets, transition steals and trying to get into the game that we play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We definitely need to help them. They have a lot of weight on their shoulders. They're controlling the ball the majority of the time. They have the majority of the points. No matter if it's the offensive or defense side, we're backing them up. They can have their foot on the gas as much as possible knowing that if they have to take their foot off the gas a little bit, we're going to pick it back up. There are going to be times when they get tired or they're not going to bring the ball up the floor. That's where we are their backup as role players, as people on the bench doing what we need to do to take a little weight off their back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We were playing like how we play. We were running and talking and playing free. We were just trusting one another. We were getting back into the mentality of trusting the pass, trusting the next pass and, on the defensive side, just trusting the person behind you, trusting the person who is talking."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Definitely can. We're not going to say that Game 4 was our best game. Game 4 was a good game, but we're not hanging our hats on it. We adjusted, and now it's just taking what we did in Game 4 and adding a little bit more aggression into Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,I wouldn't say it's a new series. Everyone just counted us out after the first three. We are not going to count ourselves out. We are going to double down and put ten toes down and make sure that we are giving it our all on the court. Put our heart and soul on the floor and do whatever it takes to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's going to be loud and nasty. You do your best not to focus on the crowd. There's going to be a lot of people talking to you. Social media, walking down the street, you're in the hotel room, you're in the hotel, you're going to hear people talking to you, you're going to hear people talking to you coming to the arena. It's part of the game. Part of the job. You have to deal with adversity and people always telling you you can't, and you've got to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"That's a hard question. Just being able to be here and learn with my family. I wouldn't have expected myself to be in this spot whenever I looked at the draft a year ago. It's June 15, and the draft is a week away. Last year, a week away from the draft, my heart was pumping because I didn't know what was going to happen. And now I'm playing in the NBA Finals. So now it's just trying to just learn as much as I can, enjoy the moment and then just bring the energy and just make it lively in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"That specifically wasn't the conversations, but the vibe was always good because we won, right. I think we also showed that that's how we've got to play and how we should play the game. That was more so the reason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"As a team, when you play professional sports, you never quit. You always fight. You always play. You always compete, and I think we showed that the last game. We had that energy, like a little bit desperation. We have to treat every game like that. There's no relaxing. We've got to play our best because obviously we're playing against the best. But we are going to stay together and compete until the last game. So that has to be the mindset no matter what. There's always been history in sports, in different sports. So I think as an athlete, you should always believe and always keep fighting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Well, we have our schemes and we have a certain way that we play. I think it's more so understanding what we want to be and how we want to create certain mismatches and certain drive-and-shot opportunities. It's not so much changing our playing style right now. We've got to keep playing the basketball that we played all season long that got us here. We've just got to make sure that we create the spot and the spacing for Kyrie and Luka. The first three games, we didn't do it as much. So they had to take all the shots and they had to settle for different shots. Game 4, we played with a different pace. We got it up quick. That creates mismatches and better opportunities for us, and also creates an open floor, for example, and Derrick Jones, attacking and stuff like that. It's more about finding the right spacing, but there's no time to change our style right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Whatever it takes. That's the mindset, it's not going to be perfect, especially against a team like that. There had to be adjustments obviously because they play different than other teams. But I think we have great guys, smart guys, high-IQ guys that can adapt to changes, that's what we showed. Last game, overall, still the energy was the key factor. And one of the guys who got us going early, for example, Dereck Lively, just like having that energy and alertness helps us to be on the same page, communicate better and have the right rotations down. And that's what we've got to keep doing. Challenge every shot, they are a great shooting team, so you can't have moments where you mess up multiple offensive or defensive plays because they are just going to go on a run. For us, the energy kept us being alert and helped us adjust to the defensive rotations, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought they were really good in Game 4. That helped us get to Game 5. But just understand, we can't have three on the ball. They are too good at being able to make that pass. They are the best team at shooting the three. There are some things that we can clean up, and we're going to have to be better here in Game 5 if we want to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think what helps is we were in that situation last game. So not to change or deviate from what we talked about in Game 4. It's just take each possession one possession at a time, and hopefully we can put ourselves up winning each quarter. We ended up doing that. Same thing that we are talking about today and tomorrow is we can only focus on Game 5, and trying to find a way to win here in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, one, it's hard to win in the Finals. And so I think, as you brought up, each game, we have gotten better on both ends, offensively and defensively. So the trend is to continue to get better. Hopefully we can do that in Game 5, where we can get better defensively and offensively. We started to knock down shots here in Game 4, and hopefully we can get those same shots in Game 5 and have the opportunity to knock them down. But looking at Luka and Ky, those two have to set the tone for us and everybody else will follow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think, and I'm not speaking for him, but just from experience, just as an athlete, you want to get another opportunity, and he has that opportunity here tomorrow night. Hopefully he can take full advantage of that. Make some adjustments and look back at Game 1 and 2 and see what they were doing to him defensively and hopefully take advantage in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Our defense didn't really change. I think just the effort. I think Luka participated at a high level, and he was really good on the ball. He came up with some deflections and steals. We believe that he is going to be involved in the pick-and-roll tomorrow. We're going to need that same effort from him, but also for the guys that are there to help protect him, they will be ready to protect him. But he's got to participate at a high level, and we believe he will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he looked like he joined a special company. He looked like Ray and Steph. So we're going to need that here in Game 5. If it's a close game, hopefully he is able to knock down those same shots, get those same shots. But it was great to see Timmy knock down those shots. Hopefully he can build on that, and as a team we can build on that. We are going to need that here in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"They are not a team that changes. They are a team that makes you change. So they are going to probably look to see that they had some good looks from three that didn't go down, and also being able to probably get Tatum and Brown going early. Having those two attack our defense early is probably something that could be an adjustment. But for them, it's shooting the three, creating in the three and then capitalizing on your mistakes. Hopefully for us, our mistakes were low in Game 4, and hopefully they are low in Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think there's probably something to that. If we look at the analytics of our group, they are young, and as the series goes on, they get better. Hopefully that's true tomorrow night. Sometimes when you do play an opponent over and over, you get used to the tendencies and you start to capitalize on that on both ends, defensively and offensively. Hopefully our group has seen enough of Boston to understand what they are good at, and hopefully we can take that away tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I don't want you to mistake us smiling and joking around with each other and being in practice, you know, for a weakness or that we are not taking this any more serious than we were in Game 4. I just think we are here in Boston and just trying to settle ourselves. We had a meeting, just as a squad, at the hotel, where we went over film. So we were pretty locked in from there, and there was carryover into our early minutes in practice. And then when you guys come in, pretty much having fun. It's been this way since we were kids. We want to make sure we relish in this moment, don't take it for granted and just ground ourselves here, too. I think the last two games, we were even more intense when we were here in Boston. Don't think we got as settled as we would have liked. So we just wanted to try some things a little different, a little bit more smiling. And then 24 hours from now, getting ready for all-out battle against this great Celtics team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Well, to answer your first part of your question, I would be being dishonest if I just took the time to say thank you for putting those words together in terms of my interactions with people being majority of the time positive. I'll be honest with you, it's not always positive all the time. I'm human. Sometimes there's some misunderstanding or miscommunications and it takes a little bit of a longer, thorough conversations just to get on the same page. I think I've just figured out in my life, a lot of people just want the time and space to be heard. They want to be listened to. And then if they respect you and you respect them, then they'll listen to you and give you the space to say how you feel as well. I've talked about it over the past few months, just where I was in 2017 or '18, when I first got traded here to Boston. I wasn't in the place to be able to vocalize my feelings or know how to do that. I was learning how to be a man. Learning how to be a father. So part of that evolution came from that, taking the time to go inside and figure out who I wanted to become. But also, I had to accept some of the things, some of the choices I had done in my life. When you look at yourself in the mirror, sometimes you don't like what you see, and that could lead to some depression or lead to some anxiety or lead to other mental health issues. That's a big thing that I think our generation is spearheading, where I hope that the older generation can take a lesson out of our book, that this isn't just some spiritual '70s type of mantras we are trying to put out here. We actually believe in what we talk about in terms of meditation and having the ability to slow your life down and making sure that you keep your priorities straight. Because the world is not going to care about how you feel mentally all the time or whether or not you are healthy when you are at home or taking care of yourself. So you have to figure out that space for yourself and figure out the village and the tribe that you want to have around you that supports those goals that you have personally. I don't want to get too preachy, preachy. I could speak for hours. But, yeah, that's been the growth since 2017. Even before then. Just learning how to be a person in this world, making an impact in a positive way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"When I look back, getting traded here, it wasn't one of my options. It wasn't like No. 1 on my list. So when the trade opportunity got approached to me, instead of going back and appreciating the Celtics' history, I just came in with an open mind and just kind of like, all right, I'm just going to go with the flow into this. But I think that was the wrong approach. Just being young. Now being older with hindsight looking back, I definitely would have taken time to know the people in the community and talked to some of the champions that have come before me and actually extend myself to them instead of the other way around, expecting them to be there giving me advice. Because they have been through this. They have championship pedigree here. They have shown it for years. They are one of the most winningest franchises in all of sports. So you have to show your respect here. I think that's what I struggled with initially, was figuring out how I'm going to be a great player here while winning championships and also leading a team and selflessly joining the Celtics' organization or the cult that they have here. That's what they expect you to do as a player. They expect you to seamlessly buy into the Celtics' pride, buy into everything Celtics. And if you don't, then you'll be outed. I'm one of the people that's on the outs (laughing). I'm perfectly fine with that, you know what I mean. I did it to myself. They don't welcome me with a warm embrace, even though I know a lot of people in the organization and I'm friends still with some of them. But, yeah, doing it to myself. And that's what I was talking about in terms of accepting the choices. But looking back, I would have shown my respect and have more of a council around me from some of the Boston Celtics that came before me to explain what the pressure is like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"You just expect to have a magnifying glass on you everywhere you go. I don't think Boston appreciates being kind of second class to New York in terms of the media capital of the world, but this is the media capital of the world as well. There's a lot of history here off the court. The community has integrated into the Celtics' team. That's probably the best way I could say it. The community is what makes the Celtics great here, the Boston pandemonium. That's what makes this space so loud and so special, and they take pride in it. If any player is coming here, getting drafted here, thinking about coming here for free agency, getting traded here, I just think do your homework and make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. That's something I could offer."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"He was just playing with a liberation within his game and came out knocking shots. That's what we need from him, is just to stay confident, stay fluid. He's been going a great job with the young guys on the bench as well, keeping them engaged. I think that's the next part of his evolution, including all of ours, is just continue to be a better teammate, regardless if you're shooting the ball or not. I think that helps reward you when you're doing those things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, we just have to wait and see tomorrow, man. You know, change a few things up. Be prepared for what I'm getting myself into. My teammates, most importantly, and not making this about me or getting into the energy with anyone else other than my teammates. That's about it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, let's just call it what it is. When the fans are cheering, ""Kyrie sucks,"" they feel like they have a psychological edge, and that's fair. Of course, if I'm not making shots or turning the ball over, that makes it even more of a pressing issue that they can stay on me for. I think in order to silence even the self-doubt, let alone the crowd doubt, but the self-doubt when you make or miss shots, that's just as important as making sure I'm leading the team the right way and being human through this experience, too, and telling them how I feel. I've had a few teammates be in this building with me for wins and losses, so I know what it feels like for both. I try to pay attention to the positive things that got us wins here earlier in my career, but also thinking about things that I can learn from in performances that I've had here where I didn't play up to par. It's just being honest about it and just breathing through the experience and having fun with it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, by just thinking about the goal that we have in front of us as best we can, and try not to get tired of everyone talking about the history that has not been made. I've said it over the past 48 hours, just putting our best foot forward and just simplifying. It's basketball. Win, lose or draw, or win or lose, that's all that can happen. Just want to be as prepared as we can for whatever the environment is going to be like in terms of what's expected from you. But what I'm sharing with my teammates now is just enjoy the moment. We got a chance to accomplish one of our goals, which is to make it back to Boston. We have another goal in front of us, and that's to make it back to Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"No, I left home pretty early. My kids, they made the trip to Dallas. They were still sleeping when I left. So I think they felt the trip and everything. When I get home today, I'll get to spend time with them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we acknowledge that they got the best of us. Just trying to quickly shift our focus to this opportunity that we have here, Game 5 here at home. Yeah, we're looking for a good practice today, a good session to get back on track for tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It's going to be special. It's going to be special tomorrow. It's going to be electric. The fans, they've wanted to be a part of an opportunity and game of this magnitude with a chance that we have in front of us. So I know it's going to be electric here from before the game. I've been in these types of games, like where they are big games like that. The fans here, they are all into it. So I don't expect anything less."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"People are going to use different things, and whatever you need to do, that's what will happen. For us, it's understanding the opportunity we have in front of us and making sure to take advantage of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. I think we understand that they are a desperate team and they are playing probably a little freer. We know what that mindset is like. For us, it's really controlling what we can control and making sure that we are solid in the things that we need to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think they were just a tougher team. I think they locked into tendencies and played defense as a team and played very well.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think deep down, however long it takes, whatever it takes. No matter where it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nobody likes to get beat like that at any point in anybody's career in the season. But in the Finals, it also doesn't feel good. So really just want to get back out there and play again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's great. I was actually the first one up today, which is weird. I'm usually sleeping in. But it was cool just to have the kids. Got breakfast and really just enjoyed seeing them. I mean, being lovey and playing around. It's been a great morning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know, a little bit of both. I think that they adjusted and they played very, very hard and very desperate. We have to do the same thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Working on Father's Day kind of sucks. You would think as fathers, we would get the whole day off. But I guess you guys want to talk to us. Father's Day is cool. I think this is maybe the second time that I've been in this type of situation, either on my birthday or Father's Day, where I'm still working. I'm not too mad at it, but I would like the day off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, it's huge. Made it all the way back to Game 7. Knowing that feeling and remembering that feeling and using that feeling to boost our play and intensity is something that I obviously rely on them for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"No. Again, I think a loss is a loss. It doesn't matter how it was lost or by how many points. I'm a competitor and I think we're competitors, and we want to win every game. You just have to take it on the chin, just like we did, and come back and try to prepare for Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"We are excited to get back on the court and put our best foot forward in Game 5. After a loss like that, you always feel like there's extra motivation to get back on the court and get going again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"We haven't watched anything yet, but I'm sure we'll watch a little bit, at least, see what went wrong, what we can learn from it and how we can get better from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I wouldn't say it changes from win to loss. It's pretty similar every game, to be honest with you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I would say it's similar. I mean, you're never perfect in a win or a loss, so I feel like there's always room to grow and improve. And I think he does a good job of that, just keeping us grounded, even after we were on a 10-game winning streak before this in the playoffs, which is pretty rare. But also highlighting that; that that's a pretty successful accomplishment, but coming off a loss like that, there’s a lot to learn."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I think Jayson said it the other night. We expect it to be as loud as it has been all season, and we are excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"You crave that as an athlete, as a player. You dream of it, and, you know, to be a part of it is pretty special as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I mean, it would be awesome to get it done. It would be great. If we do lose, it's not like the end of the world. We'd still be up 3-2, but to do it at home would be pretty special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"You know, it's a weird balance almost. It's hard to, like, take moral victories from that, but also in the same breath, you know, it's nice to see some go through on the offensive end and things like that. But it's kind of a weird, fine line of pulling some good things from it but also understanding that we lost by 40."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"To be honest, like some of my best games I've had as a player are my worst-shooting performances in pregame shooting and shootaround, but some of my worst nights have been where I've felt really good in warmups. I feel like there's no correlation, to be honest with you. It's just the rhythm of the game and feel for the game when you're out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I put Luka up for sure. Luka, Patrick Beverley. I don’t know. The third one is up for debate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"My G.O.A.T. is Kobe Bryant. Growing up, that's the reason I play basketball. That’s the person I pretended to be like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think it's definitely a bit of a challenge when you get to be where you feel like you do have spare time, and it's finding out the best ways to be able to use that spare time. For me, I enjoy being around my family and playing video games. I love FIFA. So that's usually what I do in my spare time. I love coffee. So I tend to really just do that type of thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Just drink a lot of water, man. That's my advice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think it's a little bit of everything. I think it's do-or-die, and I think we know that we weren't playing to the level that we should be playing. So I think whenever we play games like that, it's enjoyable. I think we need to continue to ride that momentum and make the adjustments from the game that we won and be ready to go for tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just piggybacking off what we did in Game 4, trying to take it to the next step, taking it one game at a time. Having a lot of patience and staying motivated, staying encouraged. It's a long series. We can make it a long series if we do the right things. We have a small margin of error, and we are going to make sure that that margin stays small."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was a lot of fun being around the home crowd, had a lot of energy in the arena and just doing the things that just kind of like made the game fun. You know, you put a lot of love into the game, you get a lot of love back. Trying to stay consistent in those areas, what we succeeded in, how we were there for each other and how we picked each other up and staying positive. That game, we were playing desperate. We didn’t want to go home. Just give us some type of life, and that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just brought me back to life in all honesty. I felt like I had a terrible start and I didn't really get to a point of playing until like the third because of the simple fact of the mistakes that I made out on the floor, which obviously, like at the end of the day, I'm never going to complain whenever they make that change, which is taking me often floor when I'm not out there being at my best. Scored a couple of baskets down the stretch, got the blocks, gave us a lot of energy at the time because I felt like I was actually doing something to impact and help the team win. It was a breath of fresh air, I would say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Last game, I felt like we got a lot more comfortable, wasn't worried about the mistakes or anything like that. Maybe I was worried about mine at the beginning but just throughout the game, just seeing how guys were playing and just the energy and the effort that was given out there on the floor it, would have been a big slap to the face to those guys if I would have never came out and did the same thing. Like I said, we got comfortable for sure just playing and having fun with the game, doing the right things."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, you know, I don't think he really said anything to the refs as much the last game. Just shows that he's taking that step in the right direction. We have to be able to do the same thing. When it comes to the path to success, there's a lot of failure in that. You have to use those failures as a lesson to really just go down that path and keep going and just find some type of way to be better than the last."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not lately. I would say living in the past when it comes to something like that, I feel that would pull me further away from the game where I am at right now. I don’t really worry about how my journey started off, I care about how I finish my journey."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,Obviously we are going to be upbeat. We're focused throughout practice on what we have to do. It's just about being relaxed and making sure we're ready once the game comes.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"We know it's going to be loud and it's going to be an atmosphere the fans want to see them win, but it's our job to stop that as much as possible. We know it's going to be loud and rowdy. We just need to make sure that we stick to our game plan and stick together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think that's the thing is making sure I stay ready and then when I come in, doing what I can, and that's bringing pace, trying to relieve as much as possible for Luka and Ky when I’m out there bringing up the ball. But letting the game come to me as well. I think that's the most important thing. Not trying to go out there and score 50 points or whatever. It's just about playing in the game plan and attacking where I can attack."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I do think so. I think it showed a lot about us. But I think the key for us is going to be do that when it gets hard and when it gets tough. We've seen where they hit a couple threes or coming out of a timeout, they will hit two or three threes, and it's just about how do we react to that and get back to our game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's been a lot of reflecting on that. Even just looking at this year and playing in the NBA Finals and going to an Olympic Games, the two biggest stages in the world. So I think I'm forever grateful. It's easy to take it for granted, but I've been through injuries and not being able to play and missed out on events. I'm just making sure I do everything, and grateful that I'm on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Hopefully. Obviously he had a great career. And if I can do something like that, it would be amazing. But it's going to start here, and hopefully we can get this next win and keep building with that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, that's the only way we can look at it. If we lose, we're going home. So we need to make sure that we win every quarter, every possession. I think that's kind of the mindset is make every possession important, and then if we do that, we can win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think it shows a lot of character with us with being able to fight. You know, we could have been on vacation now, but I think it shows how we want it as a team, and we are ready to fight for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I would say Real Madrid is in a league of their own. They are at the top of the Euro. But obviously Boston has been -- I think Boston, Lakers, they are obviously the two major NBA teams in the league and they have been since day one. So it's obviously a little bit of comparison."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's obviously different because it's the Finals. Every team plays the whole season to be here. We are the one to be here in Boston, obviously. So it's a little bit different. But you've got to play basketball. You've got to give everything you have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, we talk about it. I think the most important thing is to show that we believe. I think we showed in Game 4. If not, if we wouldn't believe, we probably wouldn't have won that game. So I think obviously the talk is easy to talk about it, but then showing it is another thing. I think we showed it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,The change is we needed to win the game. I think we didn't play our best the first three games. So we had to change something and play better in Game 4.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"At this point in the season, a lot of things going on. If I'm playing, I'm fine. No worries."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think everyone. Everyone. In the preseason, that was our key discussion, how to talk on defense. When we put it together and we play good defense, everybody is talking. Communication is a big part of our success on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Not really. Just happy being a father. It's been the best thing in my life. So that's it. Just being happy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,It was a very special moment. I know they are both -- I think they are very proud of their sons. So they are happy that we're happy on the court together.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"We have a great group, resilient group, and we don't like to lose. We do our best to prepare each and every night, each and every game, and we look forward to the next game on the schedule."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just by being disciplined. Controlling the pace. Felt like there was a lot of stoppages in Game 4 where they were blowing the whistle a lot. But we want to get up and create more of a pace to the game, and I think that helps dictate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think we are ready for Game 5. I think that's the best answer that I got. I think that we're ready. We're at home, and we're looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's definitely a blessing to be here, to represent the Celtics, my family, the organization, the community, our greater community. It's an honor that I don't take lightly. So just to come out every night and play for something, for what I represent, I think that matters. My relationship with Boston has grown. I've been here for almost nine years now, since I was 18, 19 years old. I've grown up. I've become a man here. Boston is special. I'm looking forward to Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just that you can't take it for granted, and it's going to be difficult. You're going to have to fight and just stay in the moment. That's what matters the most. We come out and be a team. Win as a team, lose as a team. Just come out and be the best versions of ourselves. That's the only experience that you can really experience that you can really speak from in the playoffs. At this level, you have some very talented basketball players who are going to be on the floor, and you've got to bring it every single night. And if you don't, you can see what happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 16, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"This is what we all work for. We are at the precipice of completing what we set out to do at the beginning of the season. So I think it's not difficult to get everybody in that locker room on the same page right now. It just needs to remind everybody that it's just one possession at a time. We do it together and we fight like our lives depends on it, and I think we'll be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,A simple way: an ass kicking. That’s the simplest way right there.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we felt good, felt confident. Just didn’t play the way we’ve been playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Not exactly. But, as we’ve seen today, they just played harder, and that’s unacceptable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that they played harder. Every loose ball, 50-50 ball, they got to it. Honestly, the turnovers, missed shots -- combined that’s not a winning recipe."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Absolutely. Like you said, a year ago this time, we were down 0-3 and we were essentially fighting for our lives. So very short answer, yeah, we understand what it's like from their point of view, and you know, they came out super aggressive. They played extremely fast and took more shots than we did. You know, they were really concentrating on attacking the offensive glass. They got way more rebounds than we did. So, you know, they played harder tonight. Obviously, we didn't shoot the ball well at all. It's something that we can learn from."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Give them credit. They played well tonight and we didn't. We had the right mindset and right intentions. We wanted to come out and play super well and win, but it just didn't go that way tonight. But, you know, we are fortunate. We get another opportunity on Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, not to harp on it too much. It happened. We can't change what happened tonight. You know, we always say you lose by two or you lose by 30; they all count the same. But we do need to be better. We're not making any excuses. We need to be better, and we will. We will be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think we were a little -- I think this is the most stagnant that we've been this series and the worst job of owning our space on the offensive end and doing what we wanted to do instead of what they were forcing us to do. And, you know, we did a great job of that the first three games, and this one, we didn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think it starts on the defensive end for us. We didn't get many stops. So they were allowed to set their defense up, and just naturally, when you're scoring at a high rate, you feel good about yourself. Your energy is higher. Tend to probably play better defense. So it all starts on the defensive end. We've just got to do a much better job containing them, making it tougher, and getting stops."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"A little bit of both. You have to, to move on from it, win or a loss. We're obviously going to watch film and see a lot of things that we need to clean up and do better. But you can't worry about it too much because we have another game on Monday. Like I said, not making any excuses. We've got to be a lot better, and I believe that we will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think it's going to be as loud as it's ever been, in my seven years of being a Celtic. Excited to go back home. Celebrate Father's Day on Sunday and compete for a championship on Monday. So it should be a lot of fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he's not quite there, but we're going to make him available. But we're only going to use him in very specific instances if necessary."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just have an understanding of the environment. So at the end of the day, both teams have to keep the same edge and same chip on their shoulder. But you can't be distracted by anything. It really doesn't matter what kind of game it is. If you don't run back on defense, you can't win. If you don't rebound, you can't win. If you don't execute, you can't win. So just focusing on the details, the effort, the execution, all the things that go into winning regardless if it's preseason, regular season, postseason, or the Finals. The process towards winning remains the same. We just have to hammer that home and for however long it takes, stick to that process."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Not quite there. He's available but only in very specific situational instances.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah. He's not quite there. He's available. We'll use him in very specific instances (laughter).
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I haven't really thought about that. Focused on Game 4. One of my favorite places in the world, so that's it for now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, I have different routines, whether home or away, but they are relatively the same. Yeah, about the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think obviously having an understanding of the environment and what we are trying to accomplish. But I think we've done that throughout most of the season when we've been able to dominate the transitions and the margins of the game, and when we've played well and not played well, still give ourselves a chance because of the margins and the discipline in these things. Dallas is a great opponent because they test your discipline, like every single possession, and the second that you're not where you're supposed to be or you don't execute your angles properly, they take advantage of it. So our opponent has forced us to work to be more disciplined, and we have to stay that way for however long the series continues."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"You can definitely take something from it but at the same time, I thought Dallas played great. Give a lot of credit to them. You know, all their guys, whoever went in, well-balanced. Thought they played with a ton of energy and physicality. You've got to give them that. And they are a great team, and that's Dallas. That's the reason why they are here when they play like that. But you can definitely take some stuff from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"They did a great job flying around, making indecision on whether to shoot it or drive and their multiple efforts. And I thought their five men did a great job protecting the paint. Whenever we went in for a layup, they had multiple guys contesting. I thought they did a great job flying around on the defensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I don't know, always in situations like this, it always goes back to us. But you have to give Dallas credit. They played well. They played really, really well. And that's the reason why that they're in this, is because when they play like that. So I thought they just outplayed us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Preparation doesn't guarantee an automatic success. And so I thought we had a great process. I thought we had a great shootaround. Thought we had a great film session yesterday. I thought the guys came out with the right intentions. I just didn't think it went our way, and I thought Dallas outplayed us. They just played harder. You have to prepare to put yourself in the best possible position, but it doesn't guarantee anything. At the end of the day, we have to just maintain our process and get ready for Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Anytime there's two-on-ones and little indecisions, they do a great job cutting behind you and wedging under and getting in. I thought Lively was great in that. We had 26 misses in the first half and only two offensive rebounds, and they had more. So we've got to be better in our defensive rebounding, and we have to be better getting offensive rebounds when we miss."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I learned that Dallas is a great team and you're going to have to earn it. There's a lot of stuff that we can control. We'll go back on the film and we'll watch that, and we'll really try to be disciplined and control it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't know. I thought Dallas played really -- the more I said it, because you have to give them credit. It's not about us. It's about our opponent and having respect for them. And you have to give them credit for how well they played, and that's the most important thing. So it's less about us and more about how they played. They played well. They played hard. We have to be more disciplined in how we defend and attack them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,It wasn't as good as Dallas's was. I thought theirs was a lot better.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,I'm not comfortable. We got to win. We got to have a lot more wins. We got to win a lot more of the little battles. Got to stay disciplined. We just got to replicate what we did this game. Do it the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"A mix between a bunch of fruits -- not vegetables -- bunch of fruits, and just some recovery stuff. Making sure by body don't cramp or anything like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"They're my family. We've developed a lot of trust with one another, a lot of chemistry. That trust just comes down to if you get blown by, they know I have their back. Just at the same time, I know if I got blown by, I got people behind me to back me up. It's really just doing whatever up can to make sure whenever one steps, we're all stepping with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,It's for her. She helped me make it. She's going to help me make a lot more. She helped me make the free throw. She helped me make reads. I'm just happy for having Luka pass me the ball in that position. I'm happy I knocked it down. Just got to be able to make the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"If they leave me open in the corner, I'm going to get them up, for sure. It's just having that trust. Luka is going to give me the ball. As soon as I shot it, he kind of jumped for joy when it went in. Just having that reaction from my teammates is just amazing. Makes you want to just learn, just practice and just do more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Whatever doesn't kill you really makes you stronger. No matter how many times you get hit, knocked down, get up, get up harder than you got knocked down. Hit them harder than they hit you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"As I jogged down, I slowly heard it. It kept getting louder and louder. Whenever you have the fans hyped like that, backing you up, it makes you want to play that much more free, with that much more energy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I'm happy he was able to get out there, feel the energy, feel everything about the experience. He hasn't been able to step on the floor for a long time now because he has been hurt. Just going out there, I was telling him to slow down, just enjoy it, feel your way through this game. Don't rush anything, just feel your way through the game, find little holes, absorb it all. I know he did. I know he's thinking about a lot of things, but I got a lot of trust in O Max."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I wouldn't say it's comfortability. I feel like we go out there and we play like we're desperate. That's the mentality we need to have in these games, going out there doing whatever you can to win. No matter if you're diving out of bounds, diving at the ball, chesting up with somebody, trying to be aggressive and strong. A lot of this playoff season, playoff series, has just been finding out who we are, finding how much can we get hit and then throw one back. It's definitely been an enjoyable time to just see my teammates and myself just grow and adapt with one another with what's going on on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, he trusts us. He trusts us to know he's going to play the best defense he can with as much energy as he's got. If they get by him, he knows we're going to back him up. He knows exactly what we're going to do and how we have his back. Only thing I told him, Look, going out there, first two times you get fouled, don't say nothing to the refs. That's all I got. Just please don't do that, and I'll make sure you get open, make sure you're going be comfortable on the offensive and defensive end. So just knowing that whenever he is going out there playing defense and he's locked in on defense, he just makes everything fall into place better on the offensive end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I wouldn't say we're overly happy. We enjoyed this win. But we're not jumping for joy. We got to win. We do what we need to do for this game. Now it's getting into Game 5. We're going into another hostile environment. Now we just got to take from what we did this game, learn to how they're going to adapt to this game, do whatever we can to emulate, make this happen again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think that's a really good question in the sense of the talk is, you know, no different than 1, 2 or 3. You know, we have a game plan. We've got to play faster. We've got to guard the three. The series numbers, I think we all understand what that is. So it's not so much that we are going to harp on that but understanding that we've got to play 40 minutes of our best basketball tonight, and that's what we're talking about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about the record or the series is 3-0, somewhere in this game, there's going to be a point where either team is going to have to make a stand or they let go of the rope. And so that's just human nature. And so if it happens to be us in the sense we are down or we're fighting to get back in the game, there's going to be a point, if there's going to be a fight, or do we just concede. Or vice versa, where Boston goes, we've got another one on Monday. That's what -- there will be a point in this game where someone is going to have to make a stand or they let go especially of the rope. We'll see when that point comes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think when you talk about the three games, getting off to a good start is one, and then the fight at the end. You know, we're playing from behind, and we have to play perfect. These are positive things. But again, we have to play with pace. And somewhere between the second quarter and third quarter we tend to just walk the ball, and that's the benefit to Boston. Tonight we have to leave the -- the gas tank has to be empty at the pace of not walking but running for 48 minutes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think -- I don't get involved with the medical. So I just repeat questionable or probable or whatever he's taking. So I let that -- that's between medical and the player. So I can't comment about what -- if he taking a shot. But injuries are part of the game, and it's June. Everybody's sore and tired mentally. And so it's about survival. It's about being able to understand if you've been here before, you have to train to play to June. And so these are a lot of lessons, not just for Luka but a lot of my guys are learning. And so, you know, tonight, injury or no injury, we have to go out there and play our best basketball and find a way to win. And Luka has been incredible up to this point, and has still been incredible. For whatever reason, there has been some personal attacks on him, but he will learn from them and he will be better when he comes back from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Great question. I think when you talk about our bench, we need everybody to score. And then when you talk about our team, we need everybody to score more points. It's not just our bench. It's not just Luka and Ky scoring. We need everybody to pitch in. We are getting great looks. Unfortunately we just haven't made them. So tonight hopefully is the night that everybody will be able to score. But our bench has been, you know, someone that has helped us win in the playoffs, and we are going to need them tonight. Someone off the bench, Maxi, D-Live, Josh, Exum, someone has to be able to step up and make an open shot for us tonight, and we truly believe that will happen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at today's athlete, the game of sport is not to be perfect. It's just, you know, to win. And when you look at what's come out here in the last day or so, if you've watched the Mavs, Luka has improved his defense. But we are asking him, or some are asking him, to be a shutdown defender. Well, he's never been on an All-Defensive Team, but he's been on five All-Pro Teams, first team. So that means he's one of the top five players in the world, and he's playing the game the right way where he can find open guys. But when you're on the biggest stage, there's got to be -- someone's got to poke a hole. This will only make the great ones better. When you look at, we talked about it yesterday, with LeBron, Michael, the greats, the G.O.A.T.s, they all were poked at and they came back stronger and better. I truly believe Luka will come back stronger and better. Some criticize that he could never get this far. But he's here. And unfortunately as a team, he said it best: We win together and we lose together. And that's -- we lost three in a row. We are trying to find a way tonight to win. But sometimes when you are a free agent in the media business, you've got to say something crazy to get a new contract, or likes, or clicks."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"No, I think it's just everybody has -- this is a free country. Everybody has the right to their opinion."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is a special group when you talk about that group in that locker room. They protect one another. They play for one another. They play the game the right way. They cheer for one another. And so is there extra? I don't think there's going to be extra. I think the motivation right now is to get off to a good start and find a way to get a win. But nothing changes about the way the group feels about Luka. Tonight I expect everybody to play their A Game. I think sometimes we -- you know, the Celtics are a good team. Let's not forget that. It's not that we are not playing defense or it's been blowouts. It's just been a couple mistakes that they have taken advantage of that we will learn from as we go forward, and if we are ever in this situation again, hopefully we can use that experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"D Live was great. His energy was great. His ability to give us second opportunities. He displayed his range tonight with the corner three. He was really good. He's been good. Giving us second opportunities, picking up a foul, getting the offensive rebound, was needed. I thought he did a really good job this evening."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We had to play our A game. It was this or we go on vacation. I thought the group did a great job of not pressing, letting the game happen. The flow was there. We've done this in the first three games. It's just we haven't been able to capitalize. We made the mistakes, and they've capitalized on it. They shot the three well. We tried to keep them off the free-throw line tonight, not give them second opportunities. I thought they did a really good job of being able to execute the game plan and let the game come to us. We made awesome shots. Our role players stepped up and made some threes. That's what we needed tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he was great. He's been great. Some would say differently. He's averaging over 25 in this series, I think. He's playing at a very high level. I don't know so much respond. He's been doing everything for us on the offensive end and defensive end. I thought he played his game tonight. He didn't force anything. I thought he was rebounding and let other guys... With the pace, we talked about it, we got to play faster. I thought he set the pace for us tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought they were great. It was a carryover from Game 3. I thought the energy group that ended in Game 3, fourth quarter, the group, energy and pace on both ends. Defensively we got stops. Offensively we got into the paint where we could capitalize. I thought Josh's energy has been great. The defense, again, in this series has been really good. It's just for us, it comes down to not making a mistake at the wrong time, and tonight we didn't do that. We capitalized on their mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It thought it was great. He was Luka. He's been Luka. There wasn't a different Luka out there. He played at a high level. He was great. He's been great. He's one of the best players in the world. As much as we want to criticize, he's a hell of a player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, the score. It's real simple. We don't have to complicate this. This isn't surgery. Our group was ready to go. They were ready to celebrate. Understand, we made a stand. We were desperate. We got to continue to keep playing that way; understand they're trying to find a way to close the door. The hardest thing in this league is to close the door when you have a group that has nothing to lose. Tonight you saw that. They let go of the rope, you know, pretty early."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"No, he was in the right spot. He took it from there. He can shoot. That's the next step for his development, is being able to shoot the three. He's young. But as a 20-year-old, he's grown up in the AAU circuit where in high school, he could shoot, he could handle. He'd tell you he played point guard. His ability to be able to bring the ball, being able to shoot the three is the next step for him. He has all the skill set. Right now, for the role we need him to do, is do what he did tonight: offensive rebound, change shots and be able to guard."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's who we've been all season. Exum has played at a high level for us all season. He's been able to run the offense. He stepped up and made big shots for us to win. Then I thought tonight even the one he shot from out of bounds, he made it, that could easily have changed his confidence. He was aggressive while he was out on the floor. He was great. We're going to need that on the road."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, again, we are desperate. The ball starts to move. Guys are not overthinking it. Again, being able to make some threes tonight from our role players were huge when you talk about D Jones, Exum and then D Live. Just understanding that's who we've been all season. We can shoot with the best of them. Tonight we displayed that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think, again, we have nothing to lose going to Boston. That mindset of being aggressive. Then to answer the first part of your question, Luka, as we know, can play defense. You saw that tonight. Some of the criticism that he's had here of late, for whatever reason, talked about his defense. I think he stepped up and was there. He knows in Boston he's going to be right back in the pick-and-roll, so he's going to have to compete and play defense again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought everybody who participated today was ready. I thought O Max, as a rookie coming off of injury, I thought he did a good job getting his first minutes in the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, just by putting it into perspective what we're up against. History is going to be made either way. We'd like to be on the right side of it. It just comes from the same sentiment, same phrase I was using the other day, just putting our best foot forward. We felt like Game 3 we had a good chance to close out that game to at least put is in a competitive spot. We waited until Game 4 to ultimately play our best game. Took long enough for all of us to get to the party together and to play for each other the way we did tonight. But it's definitely a possibility that we can replicate it. We understand we're going against the same great Boston team that is going to make it tough. We're going into their home den. We have another opportunity to extend the season. That's all we can ask for. We handled our business tonight. But the job is still an uphill battle, and we understand that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It was how we started off the game. Our ability to go home, get some rest, not having the same 48 hours to get our bodies ready and recover. So it felt like it was pretty much the regular season in terms of that aspect."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I think he made a few people eat their words. In a healthy way -- I'll say that in a healthy way. I don't want to curse up here or anything like that, get into any unnecessary beef, right, between us as players and the media. I think this is his first opportunity and first taste of what it's like to be on this stage, and to not play up to your capabilities or be out there toward the end of the game where every mistake is magnified. I think that's probably what I'm really referring to, is when every mistake is magnified, there is going to be a response. That's your guys' job to give us your criticism. We go home and deal with it in a healthy way, hopefully. I think with Luka, like I've been reiterating to the guys, stay off social media as best you can, man. Enjoy the moment we're in. It's not about making it this far. It's figuring out of the little nuances to get wins on this stage. That's what it's about for us as competitors and that's where our focus should be. He responded very well. I expected it. I think a lot of people expected it that have seen Luka and known Luka. Just didn't know how it was going to happen. He made some things happen tonight that I was very proud of him. He grew. That's what we've been talking about, too, since the beginning of the series, is our growth, us trending in the right direction, figuring out how we get wins together as a group with all those external factors still going on. How do you still lock in, how do you still focus in, breathe through some of those mistakes. I think he did a great job of that tonight. Hopefully, we can still extend this series going into Game 5. But we still know we have to play our best and control what we can control."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Yeah. Crazy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's taken time, I tell you that. It's difficult because, as a competitor, you try not to display all your emotions out there to give an edge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Rightfully so, yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I think it shows you how important it is to have quality leaders in the locker room and somebody that has been through it, somebody that can talk through it, and also somebody that's more than willing to sacrifice themselves to take the bullets and the brunt of the responsibility. He knows how important it is for us to focus on the right things. We can't be focused on answering all these unfair, critical questions. Some of them may be fair, right? But if you're not necessarily out there playing with us, it's going to be hard for us to connect if you're talking s--- about one of our teammates. We're not going to go for it. I think that's what you're seeing. Not just from us, but our head coach. He's dealt with his fair share of criticism from some of you guys in this room, some guys in the past. Some of you criticize him as a coach, rightfully so, like I said. I think if it goes over a certain boundary, you're going to see a real humans step up and protect their brother or sister. I think that's what you saw from J Kidd. I am proud of him. I have the same sentiment. That's out little brother right there. He's in the Finals. He's going to make mistakes. That's also why I kind of had that kind of peaceful sentiment about me after the game. I'm not about to go up to Luka and say, It's all your fault. That's not how it works in our locker room. We dang sure don't want to start those bad habits now. I've been on teams where we have allowed the media or opinions to infiltrate what we have going on, and it has not worked out well. I think if we put our best foot forward and focus on the things we can control, we got a good thing going here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, if you're familiar with D Live's game, you know in high school he was shooting those threes. He was on a pretty good team that ended up winning a few championships together. D Live had an expanded game, sort of to say, when he was in high school. It's crazy. I was watching highlights not too long ago."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I think what we have to also account for is we're in a very physical game. When you're getting beat up like that out there every single play, you're going to have something to say to the refs. In Luka's case, his relationship with the refs is not always the healthiest during games. The referees are humans, too. We have to respect what they do. They're a big part of this game, too. It could sway either way. I think what you're seeing is him just taking accountability as best he can at this point in his life. He's a young person, still trying to figure it out. I give him that grace. Also, we have to give him a little tough love where we let him know and reiterate you got to stay off those guys a little bit. I think it's just lessons being learned. When he is locked in like that, not paying attention to the refs, he's a huge, impactful player for us, and a great leader for us. We want him to stay consistent on that and not be too hard on himself either. If he gets a tech, so be it. No one is batting an eye. If we're trying to get back into the game and we need the refs, there has to be a different perspective, different approach you got to take. Sometimes a good conversation works with the refs. Sometimes eye-to-eye conversation works with them. When you're s--- talking them, MF'ing them all the time, it can get to them too. I'm not saying we're all perfect, but we have to use everything to our advantage on a positive note."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I think it was more about Dallas. You know, I felt like they were the better team tonight, clearly. They played much better, and you've got to give them credit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I felt like we came out determined. They were the better team. They were the team that was playing harder. He's right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we have an opportunity here to be better, and it all starts with us going over this film and having a good practice session and understanding the opportunity we have in front of us. So that's what we're going to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I just know, there could have been some of that. Ultimately, you know, I felt like they were the better team tonight. We can say all these things about us. They played much better than us. They clearly outplayed us, and that's tough to take but that's the reality."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I don't know specifically. It just seemed like a lot of stuff was going their way, and I'm just eager to just look at this film and get together and see how we can be better. The one thing I can tell you about our group is that time and time again, we've responded any time we have adversity, and this is an opportunity that we have here front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, that's a good question. We definitely have to be better. Have to be more active and make sure that we're a little more aware of him, and it's something that I expect us to be better come Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm not sure. I feel like every series kind of has a life of its own. But yeah, they were in a position that their backs were against the wall, and they did what they were supposed to do. It is hard to win on the road. And even though we've had a lot of success this postseason on the road, you know, they had the momentum. They kept it going, and that was a big difference. Their crowd really rallied behind them and I feel like that helped them throughout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's hard. It's a playoff series. Teams are going back and forth. Usually, you know, I've been in a lot of these, and usually by the second game, you're making adjustments. Third game, you're making another adjustment, and that's kind of how it is. And for us, we've had the first three games, we didn't really make any adjustments. So today, they did something. We have to see what we can -- how we can be better and prepare for it. That's kind of where we're at right now. But, you know, it's the playoffs, and, you know, they are fighting for their lives, and they played better than us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,I think we always fall back on our work and preparation and understanding what we need to do. It's not going to be any different now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, it's a good question. Understanding that it's one game. You know, after we won Game 1, we put that behind us. You know, Game 2, kind of same thing and so on, and we are at this point now. You know, we have to take some things that we can be better at and try to fix them, and then you know, others kind of throw them out and just kind of do that and make sure that we come out and we play Celtics basketball. I think ultimately that's what it comes down to for us, and there's a lot of things that we can control and that I expect us to be much better on Monday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Take care of the things that we can control. Got to fight for rebounds. We've got to, me in particular, not turn the ball over and just be aggressive. Be the more desperate team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I mean, I wouldn't say throw it away. We've got to learn from it. Things that we have to go back and watch. Again, see the things that we should have controlled and done better doing that. But going back and watching film and getting better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"In particular, no. I think they let me play one-on-one, so whenever I drive, I think they all kind of space out and let me try to play one-on-one at the basket. Just got to do better playing off my teammates and finishing at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"We learn from wins, too. Wins we have opportunities to get better. Again, same thing with losses. So not sure it changes much. Got to get home. Get our rest, hydrate and lock back in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think winning is hard. I think winning at any game is hard. But winning Game 4 of the NBA Finals is pretty damn hard. So no, I think they came out desperate and I think they punched us in the mouth, and we couldn't kind of recover the way we wanted to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I guess a massive win would be -- I don't know. I think role players came in and they felt good. Obviously they are at home. But things that we have to control, we'll do our best to do that and come back at home and do the best we can to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know. I don't know. Even though I've done it. You've got to do it together as a team. Everybody has to be clicking and being, again, the more desperate team. We've just got to go back home. I think locking into tendencies, locking into the game plan, and I think we'll be okay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I thought we got a lot of good shots. I think a lot of them didn't fall. A lot of the plays we made before didn't go in the hoop. You saw a couple go in and out. Again, just a couple plays didn't go our way. So credit to Dallas. They played extremely hard. They played desperate, and we've got to do the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think the series is we are up 3-1 going back to Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"That was a butt whupping. That’s it. They just beat us. Not much to it, honestly. They just beat us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"It’s a learning lesson, for sure. Got to show up and show out every night. They’re not going to roll over. They’re down 3-1 now. They’re desperate, so they’re not going to roll over. They’re not going to make it easy on us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, I’m sure we’ll break it down, learn from it and take what we need to get better at and any carry it on to Game 5."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,Be better. About it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",SAM HAUSER,Can’t wait. Wish we could do it right now.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think for me, it's just come in and do what I do with my minutes. I think obviously Luka creates a lot of attention. Just using that to my advantage to get downhill. I've been super confident in my shot all year. Unfortunate that one of them was taken away. I just have to stay confident and keep shooting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, I think just the energy that we showed throughout the team. Even when stuff didn't go our way, it wasn't heads down. It was next possession, next possession. That's something we've kind of preached the whole series. I think we were finally able to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I mean, you said it. A lot of the times guys go through ups and downs. It's just about getting back in the gym, doing our craft, what we know. Whether that's lifting, shooting, extra reps, anything. You see everyone on this team doing that. And it shows on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, no. I think obviously Luka has to hold himself to a high standard. Him fouling out doesn't give us the best position to win. Obviously we need him on the court, and he knows that. I know he's going to, as a competitor, hold himself accountable. We did, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"One of the biggest things is I go on the court and I think I'm going to be on Tatum or Brown. Kyrie is, No, I've got him. I think that's huge. I can press the ball, be up and play on the help side. I mean, just for Kyrie to kind of step up and say, I'm going to take that defensive challenge, it's huge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Like I said, there's a lot of ups and downs that go through a series. Just the Playoffs in general. I think we knew kind of what we can do and how we can be. Obviously, we know not every game is going to be like that. I think if we stick to kind of who we are as a team and stay positive, we just need to take one game at a time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I think criticism is always going to come when we lose. I think if we won a game or two, the criticism isn't as bad. J Kidd, he played, so he understands it. All competitors, they're going to take it on the chin, come out. That's the challenge that we have to do every game. Obviously, we watch it because we're on our phones a lot. It's just coming out and playing our basketball, and that's what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think it's contagious. I come in, I do it. Everyone starts to build that pace. Everyone's running their lanes. I think also it's getting defensive stops. That helps it a lot. I think my main focus when I go in, even when they do score, All right, let's go get it, try and push it during those times. It's easy to push when you have an advantage."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just helps out my team. We were locked in, especially on the defense end. We played with pace. It helped them. I'm here to help them in every way I can. We just got to play like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it doesn't change anything. Like I said at the beginning of the series, it's first to four. We going to believe until the end. So we just got to keep going. I have big belief in this team that we can do it, so we just got to keep believing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,It's big. It's basketball. It's five people on the floor. So that's huge for us. Everybody played with a lot of energy. That's how we got to do it. We got to think the same way in Game 5 in Boston.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't know what I learn of myself. Ask me the next day, I'll come up with the answer. I don't know really right now (smiling). But it's going to take everything. It's going to take energy -- especially energy -- because it's late in the season. We played a lot of games. We got to stay together and locked in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"No, he didn't say anything to me specifically. But that speaks a lot about him. He always has players' backs. He always support us. That's a big thing, to have a coach like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Big-time, man. I think people forget he's a rookie. He's a rookie doing this stuff. He's been amazing the whole season. Just watching him grow was unbelievable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,All right. 1-for-1 -- he's 100% in the Playoffs.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,I don't even know how to answer that. Next question.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Give credit to Dallas. I think they played hard physically, and then they dominated the glass. I think that was the key that put a lot of pressure on us. And then we didn't make shots tonight, and I think that's where, you know, we allowed them to play free, once we get them multiple opportunities to make shots, and then also we didn't hit shots on the other end. We're going to look at the film and see where we can better, and then go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's a great opportunity to respond. Give credit to Dallas. They came out and they played with force, and they played great. We just regroup. We keep our same mentality, and we come out and get ready to fight in another battle on our home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"We learn from it. We take it. We don't dismiss it. We're going to learn from it. We're going to see how and why, exactly where the game was won and lost. And then we take those experiences and then we come out and we play like our life depends on it. Because it does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Close-out games are hard. Close-out games are tough. They always have been like that, and you've got to have extreme focus. You've got to come out and meet their intensity to finish things out. So we didn't do that tonight. Give credit to Dallas. I thought they played extremely well. Those guys, they crashed, they rebounded and they played with force. Some of those other guys stepped up. We've got to be better and we've got to have some of our guys step up, and that's what it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I felt like the pace slowed down a little bit which allowed them to dictate what they wanted to do. I think we have to continue to keep the pace but have some more poise. Just see where we can be better. We'll watch film and we'll see. Right now, it feels raw, so we've just got to look at film and go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"These are the moments that can make you or break you. We have to reassemble. We have to look at it and learn from it, and then we've got to embrace it and attack it. It's going to be hard to do what we're trying to do. We didn't expect anything to be easy, but it's no reason to lose our head. Tip your cap to Dallas. They came out and played well, and we've just got to be better on the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 14, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure as of yet. But we're going to watch it. We're going to learn from it. As of now, we've just got to be better. We have to meet their intensity. It's the NBA playoffs. It's the Finals. Looking forward to the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah. He was excited for me to be here. I think he was like, I remember watching you when I was with the select team at USA, and I think he just saw something in me then, that he believed I could help us win games. He's a great basketball mind, and it just goes to show you never really know who's watching."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I remember he told me about what it was going to be like to play for the Celtics and the crowd, the city, everything. It's just been so much better. I love playing there and just competing in the TD Garden. Hardy was amazing for me. He's an amazing coach. I think he kind of undersold it a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, it's playing with great players. They put me in a position to be in those moments, and they trust me. Just try to be confident throughout it all and just trust the work that I've put in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say he was a big talker. He just gets it done. Both sides of the court, just his physicality, just impacts the game in so many different ways. Just does literally everything on the court, and just does it at a really high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"No, I mean, you knew he was a big-time competitor. You don't guard the way he guards and not be a big-time competitor. But you don't really see all the little things he does until you see it like day in and day out and just the way he just impacts winning every second he's out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think we just locked in. I don't know exactly what it is. But we're just locked in. We know what's at stake. We understand that close-out games are the toughest, and we just come with an extra edge. It's going to be even harder tomorrow, and we've got to be even better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think from our experiences over the past couple of years, the thing that we've really gotten a lot better at is not relaxing, not being complacent. From game to game or series to series, we always want more. Maybe in recent years we took things for granted at some points or were happy to make it to certain rounds, where (now) we're not satisfied. Even now up 3-0, nobody is celebrating or anything. We still feel like there's a lot more that we can do. There's a lot more that we want to do. From that standpoint, just not being complacent and everybody just wanting more and being true to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"You said Summer League? I was excited to finally put on an NBA jersey. I was young. I was 19. I was overwhelmed. Everything was new to me, from being at the new practice facility. I remember going through Summer League practice with -- JB was on the team, obviously, and learning from him and learning from the assistant coaches. Jerome Allen was there; Micah Shrewsberry was one of the coaches. It was a hell of an experience, in Utah and in Vegas. I was just so happy to be in the NBA at the time that -- I was really a kid. It was a great experience, and obviously we've grown a lot since then. But I was just so happy to be there and put on that jersey for the first time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, ever since I've been in the NBA, especially with the Celtics, everybody knows we only hang up championship banners, and it's been a while since we've won one. Ever since '08, the goal is to win another one every single year. Gotten close plenty of times. It's just an honor. It's a honor to wear this jersey. It's an honor to follow in the footsteps of some of the best players ever. Being a part of Celtics history entails that you've got to win a championship. Every kid growing up playing basketball dreams about being in the Finals, dreams about winning a championship. I'm no different than anybody else."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I credited last year a lot to the success that we're having this season. We were so consumed with getting back to the Finals, in a good way, but I think especially when we got to the Playoffs, we were just ready to get back to June. In some ways skipping steps. Those series took longer than they maybe should have, and we acknowledge that. We could have closed games out a lot earlier. You find yourself in a hole down 0-3, the margin for error is so small. Last year, we really believed that we could take it one game at a time and come back from that series. But last year was a great learning experience. For one, to not take things for granted. You're never promised to make it back to the Finals. I think each and every person this year has came into the season with a different mindset. I think it has truly shown that we don't take things for granted, and we approach every single day the same. We're trying to get better, and we're as hungry as we've ever been."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Actually, yeah, somebody did walk me around the old practice facility in Waltham and showed me all the banners and the history. I was born in '98, so I didn't really know about all the championships before. I knew Bill Russell won a lot. I knew Bird had a couple. But I only ever saw '08, and then when they lost in 2010. I learned a lot about the history of the game, the history of the Celtics. I would say the first legend I met was Paul Pierce. I met him during that -- it might have been Summer League or my first training camp he was around for a few days. That was the first Celtics legend I really got to talk to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think our ability to go over situational basketball during practice. Joe and the coaching staff, they do a great job of showing us a lot of different things throughout the season of how games end, whether it's teams being up six, do you foul, or closing out quarters and how that can have an effect for the start of the next quarter. So going over situational basketball in practice and in shootarounds and understanding what we want to do in those moments, what plays and reads we want to go over in late-game situations, so when those moments do come about throughout the game, we're comfortable. We know what we're trying to run, what we're trying to get to, the different options from each set. Just our ability to translate the things that we go over in practice to the game and do it without skipping a beat."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I didn't know that. That would be really cool. But you know, you guys will probably say we didn't play anybody to get here. So we'll just have to do it again next year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I really don't listen to a lot of them. I don't really have a favorite quote. But I just think he says a lot of things that are -- like a lot of things that people don't usually say, but they have great meaning behind them, and they resonate with our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's a great player. Just tried to make things tough, make him hit tough one-on-one buckets over and over again. That's kind of what we're living with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just like to show the world that I'm a good defender and I can guard some of the best guys in the world, especially those two. They're the best. Just doing my job, staying in front, making things tough. I try to take pride in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's tough when you're playing limited minutes and he hasn't played at times, so when you see a guy like that hit a three that's been -- he works his tail off. It's great to see. It's rewarding. He performed really well yesterday guarding, and then obviously I just thought that three was a big momentum shift."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's the hardest thing in any sport, but especially basketball. Playing limited minutes, going back and forth, limited shots, it's not easy. It can be mentally really difficult. The strongest people, they prevail, and they come up when they're needed most."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He just gets his work in. He's been able to stay level-headed through the ups and downs, and it's been great to see. He's hit really big shots, and he hit three last night. But just his work. He works on his shot all the time. It's been good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,The job ain't finished. We ain't celebrating like we won a championship yet. We've still got one more to do. We weren't really talking about anything but getting it done.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's really himself. He's like authentic to himself. We all appreciate that. Like he's not trying to be somebody he's not. So I think that's kind of like the sicko side of it. He's different, but we respect that. Then the basketball genius, you can learn a lot from him as to how he sees the offensive side of things, the play calling, the game management, all that. He's elite in that. I've personally learned a lot from him, and I think our whole group has."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The first one, I think our analytics department does a tremendous job. Dave Sparks and the gang is a conduit to that on the coaching staff. We have a ton of conversations about what makes sense from an analytical perspective and how do you constantly find small ways to give yourself the best chance to win, but also increase your chances of winning. In our department, that just makes the most sense to us. Gives us the best chance to win and allows us to control the variables of the game, especially when teams don't have a timeout, which they didn't last night. So it's a credit to them, just bringing constant trends within the game that I feel like give us an advantage and increase winning any chance you can go. It's a little bit, one percent better, save a half a point, save a point, save .9 of a point, it makes a big difference over time. Second one, I think just having an understanding from a player, just looking at the lens from a player's perspective. I think sometimes when you become a coach you look at it from a coach's perspective, but at the end of the day the world revolves around the guys and how they view things and the lens with which they look at things. So you have to alter your communication. You have to alter your schedule. You have to alter things that put the players in the best possible decision to succeed. So a lot of the decisions that I make, it's like, what would I have wanted as a player. We have a ton of former players on staff that are able to help with that, so I think that's the biggest thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I would hope he does not feel undervalued by us because I think he has done a lot of tremendous things as a player and as a person. So no, I think he's one of the ultimate values. I think to have a guy like him be able to dominate the intangibles of the game on both ends of the floor is amazing to us. We wouldn't be in this position without any of our guys, and he's included in that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the thing you just can't take for granted in the game today is a coach's greatest gift is a group of guys that want to be coached, want to be led, that also empower themselves. So I think at the end of the day, just appreciate the fact that we have an environment where learning and coaching is important, and getting better and developing is important. You can't be a good coach if your players don't let you -- you can't be an effective coach. Everything starts with them, their ability to buy in, their ability to execute the things. As a staff, we're grateful. We talk about it every day. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't be here. So it's on them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The first question is part of life, like any situation you're in is going to help you for the next situation. So we should be able to take everything that we learned as a team, as an organization, last year, this year, so every experience should help you prepare for that. As far as blocking out the noise, at the end of the day we're the most vulnerable in this. So we have to remain that. We have to remain with a sense of urgency. We have to have an understanding of our environment. We have to know that we're just as vulnerable as anybody else in this situation, and how we handle that will determine our fate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, not at all. I think coaching is understanding that you can't win without the players. I don't care. I just want to win. I want to do it with good people, and we have an opportunity to do that. There's four rounds left in this fight, and however long it takes, whatever it takes, we'll see how it goes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No. No, I think that's a rather passive way to look at things. I think at the end of the day, we have to continue to do what we do. Kristaps has gotten better from yesterday to today. He's fighting like hell to play. But it's going to be up to us to protect him and to make sure that it's in the best interest for him as a player and as a person. Going into what's best for a player and a person has nothing to do with where we're at from a basketball standpoint."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, saying that diminishes the other great locker rooms that you've been in. I think everybody in that locker room would say they've been a part of other good locker rooms. I think a lot of it has to do with timing, but I think at the end of the day we're in a situation right now where everybody is on the same page, that winning is the most important thing, and that we're going to do whatever it takes for however long it takes. We just have to remain in that mindset that it's everybody's responsibility to impact winning. As long as we stay there, we have an opportunity, we've got a chance. So I think it's focusing on that is what you've got to be grateful for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just building retention and learning how to understand the why and building an awareness to your environment. You can't make decisions and eliminate emotion if you don't have the facts and you don't have an understanding of your environment and what's going on. Just really trying to put yourself in a situation -- how can we get away from the emotion of your environment and how can you get to the tactical, the facts, the truth of what's going on so that you can adjust accordingly."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It comes down to just being mature about it. You're in a very high-intensity, very high emotional state in this environment, playing in the Finals. Got a lot of people looking at you, a lot of eyes on you. But all you've got to do is just tune that out, focus on what you can control, how much energy you put in, how much effort you're going to put in, how much you're talking, how much you care about the situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I kind of forget how big the nation really is. Hearing people from Washington, from Florida, Maine, California, affecting lives, affecting people who I've never met, who I've never laid eyes on. It just makes you kind of walk with a certain light."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding the mistakes that we've made. Understanding what we did, understanding what we need to do in those moments and just understanding what each and every one of us are thinking. We can't all be on different pages when we're on the floor. We've got to understand. We've got to be one. We've got to understand what each and every one of us is thinking, what we're trying to achieve, what we're trying to do in each possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It was a lot of film. It was a lot of recognition. It was a lot of just talking, understanding we're trying to be on the same page. This is our first NBA Finals for a lot of us, and it's just making sure that we are together. It's going to be the whole world looking at you, the whole world talking bad on us, no matter where you look, no matter if it's on your phone, billboards or just talking to someone down the street. It's just trying to be able to understand that we've all got each other's backs. We're all learning from one another. We're learning from the situation, and we're trying to become better people and better players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding where you are. We're down 3-0. But just because we're down 3-0, it's not finished. It's only going to come down to us putting all we can on the floor. Our heart, our soul. Just trying to come out and win little battles because that's what's going to get us the game, winning the 50/50 balls, winning the rebounding game, winning the transition game and then just trying to stop them from what they're trying to do. We're trying to make them play into our game, but we're trying to understand what our game is because we're not on the same page."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, we can't sit here and be like, the ref did this, the ref did that. We can't control that. What we can control is the positions that we're putting ourselves in to get those fouls, understanding that if we're talking and we're getting mad at the referees, they're going to end up -- they're going to get the last laugh. We've got to be able to just be mature, be able to move on from whatever play, whatever call they're going to make on the floor because we're not able to control that. What we're able to do is focus on our reaction to those calls."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, overall I think in sports when it comes to competing you always have to believe in yourself, and that's what we do, too. Even before the Playoffs, I think a lot of people didn't believe we could be here. We stayed together as a team at any time. Obviously, it's not ideal. It's not where we wanted to be, but this is also a great learning process for everybody involved. But overall in sports you keep competing no matter what, so you just approach it in the right way. Our backs are against the wall, obviously, being down 3-0, but we still have to continue to just play hard and believe in ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think our fans have been great all season long, but obviously yesterday, especially when we had the early run at the beginning of the game. They were loud, and then when we made the comeback from 20 points, they always supported us. They're always here for us, and obviously we wanted to take advantage of the home court yesterday. So that's something we have to do tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"No, I love everybody on this team, coaching staff, everybody around the Mavs organization. I've been here for a long time now. I don't truly have a comparison to other teams, but I know it's hard to top the character guys that we have here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Obviously, I still have pain. It's not just gone now. But you make the best of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"We have practices. We analyze tape. We try to see what we have to do better, obviously, and then outside of that, just try to get my mind off a little bit, try to relax and then come back and focus my mind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I wouldn't necessarily say easier, but obviously when your back is against the wall, you can play a little bit more loose and just go out there and fight. You have nothing to lose. But overall I think the pressure remains the same at all times. You just want to win as a team no matter what. It doesn't matter if it's 0-0, whatever. We just still got to continue focusing on what we have to do, and also when we watch tape and analyze what we did, learn from it, also for future purposes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Well, that's a result of how the game goes. I think we just have to create better spacing for Luka and Kyrie to operate and get the right guys involved, and that will also give us better percentages. Also, Boston is playing a little bit different in this series than they have before, a lot of switching, stuff like that. But it's good for us to just analyze and keep improving on what we want to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought Exum did great. We probably looked back at it, we could have probably got him in there a little bit more, but we went with the other guys. We were looking for someone to be able to knock down an open shot. We had good looks that just didn't go down for us. I thought Exum's pace, his ability to get the ball into the paint for those three minutes was good. So hopefully we can get him in the game in Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think we played 11 yesterday. Everybody is on deck. Everybody has to be ready to play. No lineup changes here today. But we'll see what tomorrow brings."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think the history is there for us to learn from, when you look at great players and the struggles. You look at MJ and the struggles that he had against Detroit. You look at some Magic Johnson struggles. You look at LeBron's first time around. It's there to learn from. But as the great ones, they use that going into the next season or the next couple seasons to try to get back there because now they understand experience is a big thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think you talk about playing Game 4. That's it. I thought yesterday we got off to a really good start, and hopefully we can do that again tomorrow. You look at the end of quarters, the end of the first in Game 2 and also here in Game 3, we have to be better. Again, just taking one possession at a time, controlling what you can control, your effort and energy, and just winning the minutes when you're out there. That's all we've talked about today, and that's what we'll talk about tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think Luka is doing -- in this playoff series, when you talk about from the Clippers to today, his defense has improved. But when you look at being involved in every pick-and-roll, there's going to be mistakes that take place. That's just the game of basketball. We've just got to limit those mistakes. But he is involved in every possession. That's what the Celtics are very good at doing, is making sure when they go hunting, they get the guy that they want. And so for us, we've got to do a better job of protecting Luka."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,It was just film.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Both offense and defense. The good things that we did, and then also the things that we've got to improve on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,It was just watching film. We got to see our mistakes and broke it down a little bit for us so we can get ready for Game 4.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Defensively we had a couple breakdowns, and offensively I thought we let it slip away a little bit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Refs are going to do what they are. You can't change that. You've got to play the game the way you've got to play it, no matter what they call."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Get a win. I guess that's everybody's goal, is to get a win. That's my mindset. That's everybody's mindset. I'm pretty sure you're going to see a lot of smiles out here right now. We want to get this win. That's what we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"We believe in each other. We never stop believing in each other. That's just how we are. We trust each other. We've been through a lot. We've been down 30, come back, take a 10-point lead and possibly have lost that game. But we've been through a lot. We've fought as a team, and we're going to keep fighting as a team no matter what."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"Absolutely not. These are my guys. I've been telling everybody in the media how much I love it here, and my guys is the main reason. They told me to be me. They pushed me to be me. They don't judge me for nothing. They love me for who I am, and I love it here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DERRICK JONES JR,"The ones that are fathers, the father figures that I have on the team, they've helped me out because I'm still 27, I'm still young. I have my kids. Just seeing them being around their kids and being able to see how they interact with their kids and their families, it helps me out a lot, especially because previous teams I've been on haven't had as many fathers. I've been on a few young teams. It's just nice being able to be outside the court, spending time with my guys and having our kids around each other all the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question. Try to be simple. I think life is an incredible gift that we can't take for granted. If you've ever lost somebody close to you, that'll remind you really quick how precious life is. I've had to deal with a ton of loss in my life, just watching people that I love kind of leave this earth, and that was difficult to deal with as a young person. And then getting older and trying to deal with the perspective of being a celebrity or famous person or professional basketball player, whatever it is, an entertainer, whatever we're called, and trying to find purpose in that and why am I here. So just I think all in all, just learned how to not put so much pressure on myself, put things in perspective, and understand that I'm not alone. I'm still a young person in this world trying to figure it out, and I'm not supposed to have it all figured out. I think that's the beauty, too. Just embracing the moments that I get to share with the people that care about me unconditionally, get to know some new people in this world, go from strangers to friends. I get to know my kids, most importantly, and who I want to become for them and my wife and being a husband. Yeah, just appreciating the gifts that I've had to earn and work for and built. That's what helps me put all this in perspective, just the past few years of learning how to deal with real human emotions and not gloss over them and pretend like life is all good. That's it. Just being real with myself. Looking in the mirror and being real. If you can be honest with yourself, then the world is your canvas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, very special to watch from afar, but also as a competitor, as a hooper, to be experiencing it at this level, it's an incredible teacher for me. I use it as a moment to learn how hard it is to win, especially against a great team that's going to guard you the way that they're guarding us. The frustration is natural, just because you want to make every shot when you're in the Finals. You don't want to miss. You don't want to not play well. You give partial credit to them, but also there's a focus and a preparation you have to have. Obviously, hindsight is 20/20, but looking at the first two games and how some of my shots were a little bit pressured, more than I have had in other series, and the physicality is a little bit different. These guys on that Boston squad know my game, as well. They know it well. So they've been able to scheme for me for the past few years. So getting over this hump is something that's been on my mind for a while, watching them, just like everyone has been watching Boston the whole entire year, be the best team in the league. We obviously knew we would have our challenges, but this is what helps us grow. Going out there and competing with the best of the best, competing with Jrue and Jaylen and JT and seeing their ability to cover up some of their mistakes or trust each other to make the right plays on the defensive end has shown me what I have to continue to work on and also learn to how to think the game in a better way. I'm going against the best of the best, and this is what I've always dreamt of. Whether we win or lose, it's the growth that I look at and how I can continue to be a better leader for my teammates."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,It's been great because we're learning about each other in these moments and what we're made of and what we have to do to be great at this level.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of first-timers on this stage. I've said it over the past week or so, just it's a new space for me, too, just being with these guys and being tested at this level, being challenged at this level. My first Finals, although I was injured, I lost. You know, 2016, although we like to bring it up, was one of the toughest series you'll probably ever see in basketball in general. I don't know if those records are just going to be so easy for someone just to look at and be like, yeah, we're able to do it, too. But that belief that you can win a series and win it together. But yeah, my message to him is he's not alone in this. He's played as best as he can despite the circumstances, just injuries and stuff. He's been giving it his all. It's not all on him. Being under the microscope in this business is a lot different for me now than probably four years ago, five years ago, because I'm able to put the big picture of life in perspective and also the game in perspective. It comes easier. Then also I think the social media, sociopathic behavior. You know, your inner voice is not clear anymore when you're downloading other voices and other opinions. That can become hard. Any little thing that you give your energy to can be a distraction that doesn't positively reinforce what you're trying to accomplish. So I think we're learning that about each other right now from not only us as players but the coaching staff and everybody that's been part of this journey thus far. No one picked us to be in this position. No one anticipated us to be here. There may be a few people in this crowd right here that had an idea, but we've pretty much broken the mold of what we're capable of doing, and I think we're trending in the right direction. We have some positives going on. It obviously sucks horrendously that we're not at least competitive in this series right now three games in, but it's also about getting the experience and learning through these things and also learning more about yourself. I've taken the brunt of the responsibility because these guys in this locker room, it is their first time. So being in this position, I do feel like a lot of it is on me. A lot of my teammates would say, no, it's not just you, which I appreciate, but this is also part of my journey, and the story doesn't end here, win or loss. I'm just appreciative that we can get another chance to extend our season tomorrow and just leave it all out there. It's all about a pride thing now, and just putting our best foot forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Okay. Do you want to ask me that five years from now or are you asking am I retiring early --
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Oh, man. Yeah. Man, I haven't even given that much thought, to be honest with you. This has been the longest season I've played in awhile. It's been six years. So I'm looking at the big picture in a way that I probably was not ready to look at in my early 20s or late 20s. The way technology is today, the way I take care of my body every day and the way I have the opportunity to learn more about my body as I get into my 30s, I'm appreciating. My mind continues to get sharper. My physical tools are obviously naturally going to deteriorate, which I can appreciate, too. So adding new skill sets or adding new nuances to my game where I can be successful at this level, especially going against a more athletic league or a faster league, and you've got me over here speaking like I'm 38 already. But at 32 right now, I just feel like the sky's the limit. I have an opportunity to be on a special team that can be one of the teams that dominates in this era. That's what I've been trying to figure out the past few years, of how to be on a great team, be in an organization where I'm trusted, and also we're able to succeed and fail together, and doing it in a way where we still have each other's backs, and no one is giving up on the dream or the goal. Our goal is still to win a championship. That's been No. 1. For me, that's why I play basketball every year is just to be able to continue to get better but also to compete for championships. If I'm not doing that at 33 or 34 or 35, then we probably can revisit this. But I think right now, I feel like we're trending in the right direction, and especially this organization led by Nico and J-Kidd and our new ownership group. They have a lot of trust in us, which I appreciate, which makes my decision making on what my future looks like a lot easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think just looking back at that first year of both of them playing together Jayson's rookie year, just remember two very extremely talented guys that right away had an impact on the team that year after losing Gordon, and those guys just taking up on the challenge. I feel like that year we started the season, we lost the first two and then we won like 15, 16 straight, and they were a big part of that. So right away, I just saw the potential there. To be at this point right now, this is what we expected. I know it doesn't always work that way. But once you get to know those two guys, the type of people that they are, their drive, they want to be great, and I just -- I saw this for them. I think probably it's come sooner than expected. They're still relatively young. But it doesn't surprise me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I mean, since then, there's been a lot. They came in trying to figure things out, and just offensively they've grown, defensively. But more to me, it's been the leadership, being more vocal with our group, also understanding that there's more than just playing basketball. There's a whole other element, preparation, consistency. That's where I've seen their growth. That's paying big dividends for them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I think it's pretty easy because what we're focusing on is on our day-to-day, and today we had a good film session before coming here. We're going to practice right after this. It's really just focusing on the work. We've continued to do this. We've been doing this all season. This is just the point of the season that we're at. We're not allowing ourselves to think ahead. We're just trying to lock in on what we have to do. The job is not done yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",AL HORFORD,"So I don't really -- I guess I've heard it before. But basketball is a team sport. It's a team sport. When you are fortunate enough to play for the Boston Celtics, you quickly realize that it's more than just the team that you're representing and the things that you're trying to do. For me, being in this opportunity, I give the glory to the Lord because he's put me in this position, and for me, I know that it's more than me. We have a lot of fans. We have a lot of people. They have been waiting for this opportunity, for these moments. We've been through a lot of adversity as a team these past few years. To be at the cusp of doing this, it's something special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I would say the turnovers. To have no turnovers is always a good thing. That means that we're getting some good possessions and not giving the other team the ball.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's seeing the success of the team. I think you see how we celebrate each other. Somebody gets a big dunk or a big three, when somebody gets a big stop, that really brings energy not only to me but I feel like to everybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't know if it's rare, but there's always the enjoyment of seeing your partners or your friends succeed and do well. I feel like that's why we're at this point now. Day before Game 4, up 3-0, I feel like we celebrate each other. Even through the downs, we do our best to pick each other up. I think we've done that as a team and will continue to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, that we lock in the best we can, that we do the best to really go out there and execute the game plan and try to get stops. That really gives us the best chance to win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Nerves, for sure. You feel like the close-out game is the hardest game to win. You really just want to go out there and do your best, if it's make the right plays, if it's knock down shots, execute the game plan. You feel like of everything in the season, this is the game you've got to do it. I feel like we'll have that same kind of mentality to where we try to come out relaxed, not too excited, but execute the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,It's the final game of the season.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I don't ask her, but we've had conversations. Just watching games or even while I watched her play soccer. I would ask her certain things about how she felt, why she played the way she played or whatever it was. I think for the most part, having just an understanding and having a partner that helps me kind of get calm in situations that can help me be in position to win on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think the biggest thing is I don't think any of us care about it. I think we all really want to win that Larry O'Brien Trophy. Whatever accolades come with that come with it, but I think the big picture is what everybody is focused on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not even a little bit. I got two brothers in the league, so if I'm really going to be chippy or something, why wouldn't I be chippy with them? Everybody in Milwaukee, I have love for them. I love them because of what we've been through and what we accomplished as a team. We became very, very close. But no, I know that this is a business, and they feel like they did what was best for their organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's exciting. We're in a great spot, but we're really just focused on the next game and taking it day by day. The job is not done yet, so still a lot of work to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's important. It's really important. You've got to stay disciplined, got to stay in your routines, got to be good in practice. Then all that together leads into the game and execution. We're just trying to be as disciplined and as consistent as possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I mean, Al is just a true professional. He's one of the best teammates I've ever had. He's seen a lot in this league. He's a guy you can lean on for advice. He's seen everything you can see. But really want to get this one for him. It's like the one thing that he just hasn't been able to get yet in his career, and it'll be pretty special if we can do it for him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he's always poking his head in. I'd say he's pretty in tune with what's going on. He's at every practice. I'm sure he's talking to the coaches, giving advice every now and then. He's just a good guy to have around. He provides good advice, and obviously another guy who's been through a lot and seen a lot of things in this league. It's good to have him around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he gave me a chance in this league. I was undrafted. I didn't really know what was going to come on draft night, and he called me and gave me a shot with a two-way, and I just tried to make the most of it. Obviously I got converted up to the big leagues. It's hard to thank him enough for giving me a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's good. I think he has a unique relationship with everybody. I think he's good at finding one or two things to talk about with each guy on a daily basis that's just to keep the humanity in this professional world. He's a great human. He really truly cares about you as a person first more so than as a player, which is awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, he deserves a lot of credit for it. He constantly keeps us in check, tries to keep us right where we need to be, not too high, not too low, but right in the sweet spot. He's done a great job of that this year. Obviously we have a great lead in this series, but like I said before, the job is not done, and he's definitely kept us in check knowing that we still have a lot to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,My dad is here. It was great to have him here supporting. It's great.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It feels fine. You've got to be able to express your feelings. It's amazing just to be here, be a part of something that a lot of guys never really been able to play in. Just embracing it and try and do the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think it's difficult playing against everybody in general. But specifically Boston, 1 through 5, they all can guard. Even when you're trying to find weaknesses in their defense, they always come back or they always have a back line of defense that helped that guy out. They don't really do a great job of just playing individual defense. They do a great job playing team defense, which goes a long way and which everybody can see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I think the biggest adjustment will be being able to build on that fourth quarter that we had yesterday. Played desperate, played well. Everybody was defending, keeping their man in front of them, contesting every shot, and rebounding, making sure they didn't get any offensive rebounds. If we can build off on that moving forward, I think we give ourselves a great opportunity."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"I mean, Al has been the same way since we've been in Atlanta. Always solid. Always solid, never doing too much, never getting out of sync, keeping everybody together, an anchor on defense, talking on defense, which gives the guards amazing confidence to guard their man, knowing that he's in that back line. Just him being able to make it this far and be in this position, very, very happy to see him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",TIM HARDAWAY JR,"It's part of their defense. Like I said, it's not an individual defense, it's a team defense, and they take pride in it. They're one of the best at it, if not the best at it. It's not really him on an island picking up Luka and Ky. He has a really solid back line behind him making sure he's confident out there in front of those guys. Yeah, that's probably the reason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,It was good. I think it's important to be able to look at what we didn't do right and learn from that and just make sure we're ready.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I just think there's been certain things that we've done continuously in games that we probably should have made adjustments on. But overall we always watch film and it's always an open discussion. And I think that's what's cool with Coach, is he sees both sides of us and is able to talk it out with the players."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"When you're in the game, I'm not really studying every single foul he commits. At the end of the day it's --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"It's unfortunate. It's a hard position to be put into. But at the end of the day, he's doing it for a reason, and it's because he wants to win the game. He's a competitive guy, so I'm not holding my head a certain way. I know he wants to win, and he's a very competitive leader, and he's the leader of our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, I mean, it's obviously challenging. The refs are -- as frustrating as they can be sometimes, they're also the same as us, they have emotions, they change the way -- the same way players get frustrated, they can get frustrated. But obviously I think it can change the game a little bit, but I think that's what's helped our team is when we've been at our best, we don't let it hurt us. We kind of use it, use that energy and shift it to us. We kind of let certain things change the way the game goes. It can be challenging for players for sure, but I really back our group, and we have a group of guys that I know I'll go to battle with all the time. No matter what the energy is, I always feel like we can always turn it around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,Leave it all out on the floor. That's what we need to do.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, they're a big three-point team. That's one of their biggest focuses. They're a great shooting team. I mean, it's just part of the game, and it's like, you're saying from like a defensive point of view --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Obviously our goal is always keep a team under 100, and that's been our biggest emphasis from day one of training camp, is holding teams to under 100 points. I think our team, we've done great defensively, and I think we do have a great defensive team. Obviously they've hit some tough shots, but overall I think we have played good defense. But going into the game, it's hard to say limit them to a certain number, but obviously we want to limit them to under whatever their averages were. And obviously we know they're a big three-point team, and just like us, we're a big corner three-point team, and they've done a good job of taking that away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Mindset going into Game 4 is win. Feelings right now is to be better than the last.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It was tough because we fought our way back, so we fought so hard to get all the way back. The guys that were out there on the floor, they gave it all they got. A lot of guys that came back to the locker room after the game was exhausted. Just seeing how hard they fought, it was just tough to see how the outcome was for it. But it's motivation going into the next game, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmmm... I would say it's a little bit of both. But I would say we stay motivated and we just focus on the next game at hand, the most important game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It just shows how desperate we were playing. It was something that I saw when it came to just like guys coming into the timeout. It was just a lot of motivation. Everybody was pulling each other in, trying to stay encouraged. Didn't matter what was going on, didn't matter how the fans were. It didn't matter what was going on just like on the outside, everything on the inside is what was all falling into place together, in my opinion. From everything that I seen, everybody was lifting each other up. D Live, he was one of the most vocal guys out there with Kyrie. Whenever Luka went down after his sixth foul, everybody pulled together, just tried to make one final push. The vibe around the team was just leave it all out there on the floor. Whatever happens in the end happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,We just have to find ways to just implement that 20-2 run to just like our game plan in general from start to finish. I can't really just pinpoint on why it doesn't happen at the beginning of the games. For sure it's an adjustment that we can make to be able to come out and do it in the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,It's real encouraging. We want to be able to just survive and advance. It's the last series of the season. Don't nobody want to ever be in this position. But we just have to really just take our time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, yeah, for sure. We always want to help the main two guys when it comes to just scoring. Defensively I feel like we're doing our job. It just comes all down to just defense wins games. We just have to, like I said, just stay motivated when it comes to certain parts of the game. Not trying to force everything, just kind of like letting the game come to us in certain areas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, first, I think I just look at how long the guys have been in the paint, the low man. If it's time -- if it's like two seconds, he's going to go out. I think that's the moment to attack. Then I just try to read the game. If he comes, there's going to be a lob open to the corner. If he doesn't, I just try to take the layup."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, yeah. At some point, yeah. I just really want to win. Sometimes I don't show it the right way, but at the end of the day, I really want to win. I've got to do a better job showing it a different way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Go back to playing fun. We talk about how we come back from 20 points in the fourth quarter in the Finals. We were having fun. We were defending. We were running. Our pace was great. Just taking good shots.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just got to go away, because at the end of the day refs are going to have the last word. So just got to go away from that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I didn't really study the first Finals of some people. Obviously, they were great players. Obviously, there's the story of MJ against Detroit. That was a big thing. I think he just learned from it. It's a great experience. You've got to go through lows first to go on top. I think that's great experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just like we did before. I always talk in the regular season, there was a time we were at our very low. I think we lost five, six in a row, and from there we just went up. I think we went 17-2 to get in the Playoffs. I know that's the regular season, but it was the kind of point we all came together, and the chemistry from there went to the top. We've just got to believe. We talk about it in the locker room. I know we can do it, and we're going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they have great players. Basically, all five players that are on the floor, they can really score. They can shoot. Our strategy was just trying to make them drive more and then be on the wheel, on the rotations. I think I have to do a better job on that, just keeping in front."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Oh, definitely, a lot of holes, I think, still. I'm 25. I've got a lot of things to learn. This is my first NBA Finals, so I'm going to learn from it, for sure. But we're not in the offseason yet. They've still got to win one more game. Like I said, we're going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just keeping the team together. Like I said, we have great guys. We all know what we came here to do. Obviously, we're going against the best team in the NBA, but we're going to believe. It's a first for us, but we're going to believe, and that's our motivation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I mean, last year, just falling short on your home floor, it definitely hurt. It was embarrassing, in my opinion. I felt like the team was relying on me. JT got hurt in Game 7 and I dropped the ball. To me, it was embarrassing. It drove me all summer, drove me crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I've never been a complainer to the refs. I don't think I've ever had a history -- I don't even know most of the refs by name. I do think having a relationship and talking to them to know what you're kind of seeing can have a benefit. But at this point, I think it's a distraction. You go out there and you play the game, and you take it out of the referees' hands."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Joe has been great. Just being in this position last year, just being in the interim role was tough. Even though we weren't making any excuses, but him inheriting that position, it was a little bit more of uncertainty about what we were doing going forward. It wasn't necessarily his staff. Now I feel like he's gotten his feet under him a little bit more, even the start of this year. He's been excellent. He's been organized. He seems like he's been a lot more comfortable, and it's showed in our team. Joe's mentality is fantastic. Even today, one of my favorite quotes he said today, he was like, there's no such thing as a foul (in a war). Either you survive or you don't. Just that resonates with me because I like stuff like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's really just all mentality, mentally just your will, your focus, your perseverance, your ability to overcome self. I think that's what I worked on the most. In moments of embarrassment, in moments of coming up short, falling short is where the most growth takes place. Last year to end the season the way we did, I really attacked the summer."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. You spend so much time and you go through so many things, the ups, the downs, the highs and the lows, and it creates that. Those memories are memories that we're going to forever have together. So those are things that you're always going to carry with you. To be able to be in this moment, to potentially seal our first championship, I think that's awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 13, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Damn, that's a good question. My love for the game has definitely changed and evolved. There's been ups and downs, for sure. But one thing that I've always loved is the ability to have a platform and to be able to be a role model for others. There's younger kids watching, maybe watching this interview right now, that maybe aspire to get to the Finals or the NBA or to just be the best versions of themselves. It's going to be a journey. Just know when those moments of adversity come, just never let nothing break your spirit, because I didn't, and I won't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I just think that top to bottom, we trust everybody, and we just compete at a high level. Obviously they are great players, and it's a challenge but just consistently being in the right position and just competing. Jrue is literally everywhere. It's unreal. I don't know how he does it. Try to learn as much as I can from him, and he's just -- just when you think you've got an opening, like he's just -- he's unreal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's just a guy that just wants to learn. Some of the drills he does is just a little unconventional, I think, but like just wants to learn and wants to grow. And then every year he's been in the league, he's gotten so much better. That's just a credit to his mindset and the work he puts in. So being his teammate has been a lot of fun. I've learned so much from him, and he just continues to push me and the rest of us to continue to improve and want to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, Joe is consistent the whole time. I mean, he's probably so happy that it happened like that so he can just continue to tell us that (laughter). But he just stays consistent. He just makes the right calls, and we just trust him completely. So, yeah, it seemed pretty true today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's a sicko, so probably. (Laughter)."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Sam has been doing it all year. He gets attacked nearly every time he checks into the game, and we've just got a lot of faith and confidence in him. He just does what he needs to do. But big shout out to X. To not be in the rotation but to stay locked in and he gives us big-time minutes, plus nine, and he just does a little bit of everything out there. Then he guarded his ass off and hit a big shot and rebounds, and he just did a little bit of everything for us. Credit to him. Great, great teammate, great guy, and he was big for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, obviously the strength of this team is the team. But we understand that JB and JT, they are our guys, and they are going to make big plays and they are going to make the right play. I think that's the most important part is just we trust them to make the right play every time down the court, and they are facing literally every coverage known to man. They just make the right play no matter what time is on the clock, and we just trust them so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think experience always helps. We have a lot of guys that have been in close games and big games, and so I just don't think we panic probably as much as we have in the past. We just try to stay calm and do what we need to do. I mean, who knows if we would have lost these games in the past, but we just know we've got so many different ways to win games and trust that we can find the answer and just do whatever it takes to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"It's big time. He just stays right here, competes on the defensive end like always. And offensively he can take nine shots, he can take one shot. Like he doesn't care. And just does whatever it takes for us to win. So just having him on the team is just a big blessing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think just we had some turnovers, which allowed them to get out in transition. And just a couple of things that we've been doing really well, we kind of just let go of the rope for however many minutes that was. It seemed like, what, two minutes, they cut it to two, three or something. It happened quick, and we just settled back down. Understand it's a game of runs, and we just trust what we do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Obviously the closer you are to winning; that's his go-to. That was obviously said. But just understand that we need to play better. The close-out games are never easy, and close-out games in the Finals is probably ten-times of that. So learn a lot from what we did well, what we need to do and just understand we're going to have to play even better for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Big-time. Big-time shots. Just a guy that he wanted the ball and was able to get to his spot and rise up and knock it down. He makes tough shots, and he's just a special player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Demanded, whoa."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think Joe is a basketball genius. So whatever he says, I'm going to try to just do it to my highest capabilities. I mean, we just try to make the right basketball play every time down the court, whether that's a three, but just trying to have the right spacing and just make the right basketball play. It's not like we need to take however many threes. I think we just can win in so many different ways, and with our spacing and guys that can shoot on the court, we can just do so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Just you know showing the emotions of the game. Two guys that was excited, tired, that you know, after the game, we just -- we're not necessarily saying like one more or anything like that. We are just saying, however long it takes. Nobody is relaxed. Nobody is satisfied. Just at that moment, you know, just told him I was proud of him and he said the same thing; that we've got to keep fighting. We can't relax. And that was basically the conversation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Honestly, not too difficult from the standpoint of last year we were down 0-3 in the Conference Finals, and we really felt like we were going to come back. We almost did. You know, we were a sprained ankle away from having like a real shot. So, you know, we are not relaxing or anything like that. You know, not even focusing on winning or Friday or whatever. However long it takes, that's our motto. However long it takes, that's what it's going to take, and nobody is not trying to relax at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That's a great question. I would say that life is about roller coasters, right. The game of basketball and life and whatever your occupation is, right, we all go through ups and downs. In the toughest moments, that's when your true character comes out and essentially being the same person all the time, that's what I try to do, in the best of times and in the worst of times. That's what I'm going to try to instill in him. You've got to be the same person. You've got to be a stand-up guy through thick and thin."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, they came out swinging. That was to be expected. They were at home, and their crowd was behind them. This is obviously a big game. So we expected their first punch. You know, it's just in that moment that Jrue kind of brought us together and just clapped his hands like, Yo, we got to wake up, we got to lock in. We got to get some stops. Because at that point, they had like 25 points. In the last five, six minutes, we held them to like five or six points. But to start the quarter, we weren't getting any stops. You know, we are not going to win a game like that. We just have to reset and lock back in at that moment."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Not really trying to look too much into it. The game of basketball is about runs, and this is at the highest level. You know, it's the best team in the West at this point. They are going to make shots. They are going to go on a run, and it's just all about how do you respond. You know, we talk about it all the time. 20-point leads, none that have is ever safe. It's never time to relax. You never want to give up a 20-point lead. Obviously we wish we would have got some better shots, took care of the ball. But things happen. It's never going to go how you expect it, and we talk about that all the time. But if you want to be a champion, you have to be resilient in those moments, and we showed that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Joe does a great job of showing us clips and things from different sports, right. He's a big UFC fan. And you know, showing us fights of people that -- I don't know like the terminology of UFC, but put them in a chokehold and s--- like they about to tap out. You just see the guy or the woman who is winning relaxing because they feel like they are about to win, and then, you know, you give the other person life. Just trying to translate that to the game of basketball; that, you know, the closer you are to winning, the closer they are to surviving. Basically just trying to remind us in the group that we've still got a long way to go. We still have to play the right way. We've still got to win. They are not going to quit, and we should expect the best from them from here on out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"You just alluded to it; that we've been in that situation. We've been in a close game where we were up, and we almost went up 3-1, and then they tied it. And experience is the best teacher. We learned from our mistakes. We learned from a team at the time that was better than us, that had been there and been over that hump and mentally tougher at the time. We've grown from that, we really have. It was on display tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I've got to watch the film, but that was excellent basketball we played to start the third, especially on the offensive end. I don't know how many possessions in a row that we got a great shot. We made most of them. We might have missed a few. But the way that we started the third quarter was incredible. You know, everybody else on that court, the mindset we came out to start the third in our execution, we did a hell of a job in the start of the third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't know if it's at cut and dry as we need to shoot a lot of threes, but with the group that we have and playing to our strengths, being able to beat guys off the dribble, and the luxury that we have is, you know, with our starting five, whether it's KP or Al, everybody can space the floor and shoot. So it just puts their 5-man in a tough position. 5-men are known to usually help at the rim. But if we have guys that can attack you off the dribble and get all the way to the rim, you want to help. But we've got 40 percent three-point shooters all around the paint. So it's just all about making the right reads. We're never like, we need to shoot 40 threes a night. But if we play to our strength and space how we're supposed to, it just finds the right person, and we don't turn down any great shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, it's tough to lose him. Obviously praying for Karen, Jonnie, Ryan, the rest of their family. My junior year in college, wasn't living up to anyone's standards. I got a call. It's Jerry. A lot of expletives, but he basically told me I was an F-up and had the opportunity to be great at something. Just let me have it for like 10, 15 minutes. I thought it was one of the most impactful phone calls that I had really in my life. Stayed at his house once and overslept for UCLA open gym. Went down for breakfast and got another ass chewing because I wasn't being competitive enough. The thing I remember about him is he had a tough way of showing that he loved you, but he was super, super competitive and he really, really cared about you. He showed it in a way that kind of spoke to my language. He'll be missed and praying for the family."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, just day to day. Just the medical team and the staff just decided that it wasn't what's best for him to go tonight. Just be a day-to-day thing to see how he is tomorrow and the next day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, obviously you saw in the first two games his rim protection, his ability to space the floor. But I think the thing that prepared us this year is our depth. It just looks different. The guys ready to step in can do different things and have a positive impact, which they've done. So we just have to rely on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, it's tough. I've appreciated just his approach. Throughout the whole Playoffs, like I said, he's never missed any meeting, he's always been out there, done everything he can to play. Sometimes it's an unfortunate situation. It's nothing that he can do. Definitely feel for him, but appreciate kind of where he's at. I trust that he'll do everything he can to get ready for the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"KP, you're not playing. He didn't look right. That was it. I wasn't involved in it. Like you said, it was out of his hands, up to the medical team. They watched him kind of go through some testing and they said it didn't feel right, so you're not playing. Get ready for tomorrow and hopefully the next day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"A little bit everywhere. When you're not that good, they just throw you around in a bunch of different places to see where you stick."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"A lot of stuff. I think just the beauty of the game, the flow of the game. I think it's different. Soccer is much different than the game of basketball. A basketball star is only defined by scoring. Soccer, you really have to pay attention to the game to recognize the impact each individual player is doing, because points are at a premium. Each guy in the right position has a direct impact on the guy in the next position. So greatness, you have to pay attention and look for it, whereas in basketball you can look at a stat sheet and say, oh, it must've been this guy that have played really well. So really the depths to which you have to go to understand the greatness and the complexity, the beauty and the connectivity that goes into playing the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I wasn't out there. I have no idea.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Zero.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"It's the same steady messaging. Also you want to give them the best preparation you can as far as what the sub pattern might be and what the if/then scenarios will be. So you go over a couple of those with them, but for the most part it's the work those guys have been doing with them leading up to this point and conversations with their individual coaches, which have gone very well. I just trust the work they put in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, I think the questions have allowed me to fight that. I don't think I've gone out of my way to do it. You guys have asked really good questions based on that. I've been able to take the question you guys ask and give my perspective on it. I think at the end of the day, it's about our team and it's about putting the guys in the best possible position to succeed and have an understanding that our guys are going out there and doing everything they can as a team, and why that's so important to long-term success. I think that's what we're trying to achieve as an organization. It doesn't happen unless the players decide to do it, and they're doing it. You can't let that go unnoticed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Like if you've ever been in a fight with someone and you think you're about to beat 'em, you usually get sucker punched. The closer you are to beating them up, the closer you are to losing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Closer you think you're going to submit someone, is usually when you get submitted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"There's a lot of them. Usually every single fight. I think it was (UFC) 302, guy gets hits in the nuts, complains to the ref, complains to the referee, gets distracted, he gets choked out the next round. He lost his focus. You see (Alex) Pereira, gets hits in the nuts, looks at the referee, knocks the guy out five seconds later. So it's the approach to what happens to you and how you handle it. But the closer you think you are to beating someone is the closer you are to getting your ass kicked. Tonight I expect the best out of Dallas, and we got to get ready for a fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, you were going to expect a run from them because they had a 19-point quarter. And just by the type of shots they take alone, you knew they were going to make some kind of run. Some of those came at the expense of our offense. I thought we missed a couple reads that changed coverages and they changed matchups on like three or four straight possessions and we missed the read to get the right shot. So I would say probably 60 percent of the shots that we took in that stretch we have to get better, and 40 percent I was okay with. We just missed them. Our one-shot defense and our ability to get back to the game plan, they put a ton of pressure on your defensive game plan throughout, and you've just got to stick with the discipline of it. So we were able to do that and make plays down the stretch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Nothing. Our first half points per shot was 1.23. So I thought we getting really good looks. They just weren't falling. You just have to stick with it over the course of the entire game. I thought in the third quarter, we found the right spacing and frequency, and we made the right reads six times and that got us those shots and they were able to fall. That's where the second stretch of that fourth quarter, we missed some of those reads, and they were able to come back into the game. Those guys' ability to know that what shots they were taking, and continue to take the right ones over and over again."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"He played in the Western Conference for three or four years, and so he's played against the Mavs. And so he's had that experience. Memphis has used a similar game plan, so he was used to that. I thought with that comfort level of playing against those guys for so long, he was going to be able to execute the things that we needed to execute. And so I thought he did a great job in our switching and did a great job in our screening, getting into our spacing. And that's what we talk about with those guys, is regardless of who is in, who is out, I trust the next man up because of the work they put in and the staff that prepares them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, we got asked that question a lot because it was new. Anytime you're developing a new philosophy or a new style, it just takes time for understanding and execution. So credit to the guys where we decided how we are going to play, and we fight to do that. You know, but also just being flexible in that. So we don't want to just settle for those. I think our guys have done a good job fighting for the right shot based on what the defense was giving us. We were able to get some of those in the third quarter. So I think it says a lot about them. The guys understand the game. They understand why we do what we do, and they work to execute it as best as they can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I would say both teams have a lot of talent. So I think you have to have talent to get to this spot. That's a given if you want to make it this far. But our guys have a great basketball IQ and have a great understanding of are we playing the right way, taking the right shots and giving up the right shot. They know exactly when we are not doing that. So they have an innate ability to control the runs of the game with the philosophy that we have and execute the things. And so it's just constant building awareness, are we getting the right shots, are we giving up the right shots and are we winning the transitions. The guys do a great job of working towards understanding that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just what we talked about. Having an understanding of like we know teams are going to make runs; can we manage those. And we know why we make runs, and we know why other teams make a run on us. So you just have to constantly problem solve throughout the game. You have to ask yourself why every single possession, why did that happen? Why did this happen? Was this what we talked about? Was it not? And the guys, they fight for that because of their basketball IThey spend a lot of time understanding that. And that's part of the game. They got out to a big lead, and I forgot what we were down, 13? So that's just part of the game. But it's understanding why. Why are we down 13? Is it effort? Is it execution? Is it things we can control? And once we answer those questions, we can move on to the next phase of the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, how can I explain Jaylen? The guy just has a growth mindset. He just wants to get better. He yearns to get better. He's not afraid to face his weaknesses on the court. So when you have that type of mindset, you're just going to be able to take on every situation that the game brings you. He puts himself in every single situation that he sees in a game. He uses six, seven, eight coaches a day, and every situation on both ends of the floor, he puts himself in that. And that's how you have to grow, is to become vulnerable and on the things that make you uncomfortable, and he does that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I don't think he gets worn down. He looks pretty fresh out there. I think we could do a better be job of being intentional in the offense with the spacing at times, but I don't see him getting tired at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"We were trying to play fast, create advantages and create indecision. But we didn't create any indecision. When you miss the first read, it's not a lack of execution from the guys. It's not a lack of like trying to execute. It's if you miss the first read and you miss the first window, it's really hard to get that window back against a team. And so, you know, that's what we were able to do in the third quarter. We found the first read, bang, right there, and we got it like six, seven, eight times in a row. If you miss that first one, it's a nightmare to get a second and third one, and that's when you end up taking a couple shots you don't want to take. It wasn't because they weren't trying to. We just missed it. They do a good job of changing up matchups and changing spacing and fluctuating it. So there's about eight possessions where we will definitely watch. But we have to do a better job of seeing the first read; and when we don't, we have to find the second one faster."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just stick to the things that we've been doing. I mean, have an understanding. We were down 13. I expected that. We were down one at the half, and I expected that. You have to expect the expected. You've got to understand we are just as vulnerable if not more vulnerable than they are. And we have to play that way. So as long as we have that mindset, and when you understand that you're vulnerable and your back's against the wall, you've got to fight. And so that's the mindset that we have to have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Again, it's all about taking the right shots. It's all about taking what the defense gives you. They are playing a unique defense against us because they are one of the best teams in the league at protecting the rim, and they have two great rim protectors. So if you try to become stubborn, you put yourself in a disadvantaged situation at the other end of the floor. Our defense starts with our offense. And so if we don't take the right shot, we can't guard them. And our team has the discipline to fight for the spacing and to fight to take the right shot, whatever that shot may be. Derrick has a green light to shoot the shots because his skill set is taking the shots that make sense. He can get into the paint and shoot the two-foot floater off there, he can shoot off the dribble threes, and he can shoot catch-and-shoot threes. I love the fact that he continues to play. His confidence never wavers based on the shots he takes, and you can always count on him to make the big ones."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We just got to make history. We got to go out there and we just got to play like our lives on the line. We got to make sure we're not giving up corner threes. The game plan is allowing them to get to the rim, allow them to take pull-up twos. So we're going to keep learning to do that, but we got to be able to rotate well, talk, communicate, know where the pass is going to go, know where we need to be."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We all know what it takes. We all know we got to put everything in our minds, our body and our soul into this game. We're watching film, we're talking to one another, we're trying to figure out what we need to do. They're a great team, so you got to give them that. They know how to score. They've been doing this for a long time. We just got to be able to step up, learn and be able to adapt."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It really comes down to us just taking our foot off the gas. There were times in the game we allowed them to be comfortable, allowed them to walk into threes. That's what they're going to do. They're going to make the shots that they get, we're going to give them. We just can't take our foot off the gas. There were times in I'd say the third quarter and end of the second that we just allowed them to go on runs. We allowed them to be comfortable. We can't allow that to happen. We have to be up in their grill the entire game, and not let our foot off the gas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Next-man-up mentality. No matter if I foul out, Luka or Ky. It's the next-man-up mentality. No matter who is on the floor, what's going on in the game, we're all putting our heart and soul into trying to win. I feel like we did an amazing job throughout the whole game. Even when we slipped up, we were staying together, staying positive, doing whatever we could to try to win. We just got to be able to take care of the little things. The little details is what is going to cost us the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I didn't think it was a foul. I don't think any of us did. Just you can't take back what the refs call. You can't take back that moment. So seeing him foul out, he putting his trust in us, his teammates, as I would do if I fouled out. Just because he fouls out doesn't mean we're all going to look down and be boo-hoo, we lost. We're going to keep our foot on the gas. We were trying to do whatever we could to try to stay in the game and win. We come up short, but we're going to learn from our mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Us as bigs, we were trying to make more of an impact than we have the past two games. Trying to duck in, be all over the glass, no matter if it's defensive or offensive, try to go on a run. They were trying to pass off Porzingis' man a lot. Even with that, we were trying to put Al Horford in it, any other elephants, and try to get the mismatches, get the space and get the shots that we like."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"He came out, he was the head of the snake. I feel like he was leading us, making sure we had energy, making sure we were talking to each other, staying positive and then setting each other up. He was talking to us, saying what he needs from us, what we need from him. He's been a great leader. He had a great game today. I know he's going to have another one on Friday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"He's a great defender. He's been in the league for a while. He understands the game. He understands the schemes, what they're trying to do, what we're trying to do. There were a couple times he got on the ball, he was moving his puppies. Got to tip your hat to that. Just because that happens -- just because you're adding a new person in doesn't mean anything. We were just trying to do what we do. Get out in pace, pass the ball, throw it ahead, get ahead, get to the rim. If not, get corner threes and move the ball around."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,That's a good question. There's a lot of them.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think the adjustment is no different than the Indiana series. They didn't have him. They're used to not having him. The adjustment with Horford or Tillman, someone that they can go to. I think there's not a big adjustment. They just came out of a series without KP. We look for them to continue. Maybe somebody's minutes goes up. For us, understanding what KP does at the rim with the shot blocking or changing shots. So we have to be aggressive when we take the ball and understand their smalls are pretty good at blocking shots, too. We have to account for who is at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It was just brought to my attention. I didn't even know. Talking to Mike and Doris from ABC, today was Game 6. Just to understand time flies by. But it was a surreal moment to be able to win the championship. To do it with that team, with Dirk being our leader, Jason Terry. They were asking, What did you think when the horn went off? I was like, We wanted to keep playing, but there was no one else to play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think we're comfortable with P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with Maxi at the five. Boston has done a great job in the sense of taking the vertical game away and living with the layup. When you look at our quarterbacks, Ky and Luka, getting to the rim, we have to take that and at some point, if we can make enough to see if they can make that change. If they don't, we can look at Maxi or P.J. at the five. We're comfortable with that. We've done that during the season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I did not, unfortunately."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"That's a great question. Everybody. The game of basketball is about communication. For our guys, that's one of the things, as much as communicate, the next step is listen and be able to process what's being said. For us as a group, we've been a little bit slower with that. Hopefully we've made that adjustment and can be better with that tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think talking about the last game, we put ourselves in a position on the road to win. That's all you can ask for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I haven't talked to Dirk here in the last week. He has FIBA obligations. He has tennis lessons and everything else (smiling). He has more important things. We'll talk when we're at home and he's here hopefully for Game 3 or 4, just to get some advice of what he sees here as we go forward. But I haven't talked to him since the Minnesota series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's I think what we talked about after the game, one possession at a time. We'll watch film tomorrow and get ready for Friday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we were trying to find someone to come off the bench and give us a spark. It doesn't always have to be someone making a shot. I thought the guys that played tonight helped us get the lead or get back into the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"They called a foul. I was stuck. I had to challenge it, so ... Had to challenge because it was a close call. But the referee called it a foul. Got to move on, move forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We missed some layups. We had some good looks. We missed some layups, some open threes. Again, we miss a three, Ky misses a pullup that we would take every time. It's a one-possession game. Unfortunately, we could just not get over the hump tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he's definitely got a bull's-eye on his chest. He's got to be able to guard and understand that we're there to protect him and help him if he does get beat. Again, he's carrying a load offensively. They are putting him in every pick-and-roll and iso. He's got to be able to play the game where he can rest on offense and let others carry the load."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I don't know if it was the Celtics. I think we just got -- we missed some bunnies tonight. Understanding that that's just part of the game, I think with fatigue, mentally and physically. We just missed some layups that we haven't missed here in the Playoffs. Give them credit; they make it tough. They will wear on you as the game goes on. We got off to a good start. But I didn't see where they affected us in the sense of we missed some layups. That's just the game of basketball. It happens."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think for us, this is a quick turn, so we don't have time to, like, go to the park or anything. We got to figure out how to score the ball, take care of the ball. Again, Brown and Tatum, when you give up 60 points to those guys, we don't have time to go clear our minds. We've got to do better. That's for everybody who's playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, it looked -- looks can be deceiving."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think when you look at experience, we're all learning what it means to be on this stage and going through it. There's a lot of young players on our side who have never done this before. Just understand, we'll talk about that, that this experience that we're going through is a healthy thing. It's not a bad thing. We're down 3-0. We felt like Game 2 and Game 3 were better for us. That's the way we have to play. Then offensively we just got to get some other people to step up and make some shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,End of the fourth? I called a couple timeouts.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,That's tough. Why you guys laughing? I asked what timeout was it. I called a couple timeouts. You got to do better.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Thank you. We missed the three and we missed Ky's pullup. It's a one-possession game. We exerted lot of energy on the defensive end and the offensive end, so that's why we called a timeout. That's for clarify that. Way to step up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, they're a good team. They're going to make adjustments. They know how much of our offense over the Playoff run has been predicated on getting easy looks for our bigs. They've been taking it away, putting guards on the bigs, not really helping off of them. A lot of one-on-one defense. It's about us finishing and hopefully that creates some space where we can throw a lob."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I don't think I really had a choice. It was unfortunate that the foul was called. Luka picked up his fifth and sixth in a matter of a three-minute or two-minute span. It's tough. We still had to figure out a way to win the basketball game. We put our best foot forward, especially being down 21. We easily could have packed up and folded. But we didn't give up. We kept playing. The guys that were out there, we kept competing. Felt like we gave ourselves a chance to win down the stretch. They obviously made some big plays, some big shots. So you got to give them credit. But we got to play the way we played being down 21 the whole, entire game, playing with that pace, playing with that pride. That's what's got us here today. But when you're going against a good juggernaut offensive team like the Boston Celtics, they're going to make you pay for mistakes. You got to give them credit."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, but it was a quick look. I mean, we're in the NBA Finals. I'm not really thinking I've got to tell my guys we still have a chance to win the game, we're only down by three points. But yeah, I think probably in that stretch, I definitely could have done a better job of just settling them for what's coming. Jrue was picking me up full court. They knew they were going to pressure me to get the ball out of my hands. I just tried to make the right plays, make sure guys were in the right spots, have them understand that we still have a chance to win this basketball game. That was all I was thinking. Just even before Luka fouled out, just the way we started off the fourth quarter, giving up those two baskets where they went up 21. Again, we could have folded but we kept playing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, I just really think about going home. This is a metaphor here. Just be ready (smiling). Just go home, get the ammo ready, get the bazooka, the 50 cal ready. Get everything ready, because when we come into Game 4, we know we got to shoot our shots and we got to do it with an aggression. Defensively, we got to finish to do the things that creates that separation for us when we're playing against them. They shoot a lot of tough threes. They really rely on their three-point shot to create that separation for themselves, obviously to create that comfortability. We just got to stay positive. For me personally, again, I'm going home, dusting off the tools and just getting ready for a tough Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time a team has tried to target Luka on the defensive end. So for us, we're just trying to put a great shell defense around not only him, but the rest of the team. It's going to be a great defensive challenge for anybody to guard Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. You have other guys that are playing roles that are pretty much great team roles they fulfilled. Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, they're great offensive players too, but when you have those guys on the backside making decisions, playing high IQ, they're going to make you pay for your mistakes. Then you got you Derrick White catching the ball by his waist or above his head and still shooting the threes and making timely threes. Again, you got to give them credit. Still, we have a belief that we can win one game at a time and take this series a little bit further."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"That's a great question. I think when you see us out there, there are a lot of shots at the rim that are contested by one person or two people. I think at this point it's more of a pride thing for us to go and finish."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"For sure. For sure. The journey is the reward. I always told him this mission is bigger than us. It's just not solely focused on this year. We have a future together where we're going to continue to grow as teammates. For him to take accountability like that after Game 2, to be 20 years old, that's a big step. I definitely wasn't there emotionally or mature-wise. He definitely deserves his flowers. He rallied us tonight. Came to the bench and just told us to keep believing. When you have one of the youngest team on the team, if not the youngest guy on the team speaking like that, one of two choices. We can either follow his lead and continue to ride his energy, or we fold up. I think that we made the former choice, and we kept playing and kept competing. Just wasn't enough. But I got to give a big shut out to D Live for keeping us at bay and keeping us at peace. That was special. That was special. Those are moments that you remember forever and you carry on as a team that can help you down the line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"We just got to convert. I feel like we're getting a lot of shots that we like. When you have Luka going against Payton Pritchard or D White in the post, somebody else in the post, we feel really good about it. Now isn't the time to hold our head on not converting shots that we normally have made a majority of this playoff run. We just got to keep attacking. Nights like tonight, you kind of could expect that we were going to be very aggressive. We want to win. Our teammates want to win alongside us. For us, we just got to convert and be more efficient, see where it goes from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"You just got to let it breathe a little bit. Let the human emotions come out. Just give him a hug. That's it, man. It's easy to point the finger at just him, say, you could be better. That's easy to say. I think he knows that. But, yeah, it's reiterating that I have his back, we all have his back. It's a tough game. It was a tough call. We could have probably done a little bit something different on his fifth foul just to give us a little bit more of a grace period to set our defense and get him on a matchup. But hindsight is 20/20. We have to wash our hands of this and get ready for Game 4."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It felt great. It felt like we played really good basketball. Our defense was really good. Obviously, to withstand that run there in the fourth, that was huge. I felt like we stayed with it. We took their hit and we were able to find a way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, we needed to stay poised. We feel like we have been in these positions before and we’ve learned in the past from it, and I feel like we handled it well. D-White made a big three there late. JB and JT made some big plays, and Jrue defensively was all over the place. We just find a way to get it done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,Just continuing to play. Understanding that Kyrie was going to be more aggressive and we had to do a good job guarding him.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Derrick is special. Derrick is such a special player. He’s a winner. He wants to be in these positions and these moments. It’s just unbelievable how he continues to find way to impact the game. Offense, defense, whatever it is, he’s doing something to impact winning."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Obviously, I was probably going to play some more. Then we needed somebody from the bench to come in and give us minutes, and Xavier was amazing tonight. His energy, defensively he held his own, time and time again. He was just ready for the moment. It’s not easy being in that position. He came in and he knocks down that big three as well. But defensively he was special. I’m just proud of him because he didn’t get an opportunity the first two games, obviously, and he has stayed with it, really took advantage of it. These are the type of games people remember forever, the type of impact he had."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It was a great win. You saw how Dallas fought back and I feel like we knew that they would always fight. But I think toward the end of the game you saw our best players in JT and JB just take over the game, make big plays, get big stops and we got the win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I feel like we have been doing it all year. We’ve been battle tested. We’ve been in situations like this before, up 20, down 15 or whatever it is. Really just stayed together and stayed composed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Can’t get too high. There is still one more left. We’ve seen crazier things happen. Just get the win. Whatever it takes, however long it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,We feel for him. We know that he wants to be out there fighting with us and we want him out there with us. But we’ve always had the next-man-up mentality and to go out there and win it for him and win it for our team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"It's okay. Every time they draw it, basically call a foul. I try to be better. So got to get better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, yeah, we had a good chance. We were close. Just didn't get it. I wish I was out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, I don't know. We couldn't play physical. I don't know. I don't want to say nothing. You know, six fouls in the NBA Finals, basically I'm like this (motions with palms out). C'mon, man. Better than that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think we should have just kept playing with the same energy, keep the same people in. We were rolling down there. But then they came back. At some point we were down 21, too, in the fourth quarter and we came back. We're still going to believe until the end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Not really. Never happened to me, I remember."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just playing with pace. We played good defense and we played with pace, just driving, kicking. That's how we got back into the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think we got to figure out some things. We played three times against them now, so we're getting to know them. But I think being down 21 in the third game and then coming back was a really positive thing for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Like I said, it's not over till it's over. We just got to believe. Like I always say, it's first to four. We're going to stay together. We lose together, we win together. So we got to stay together."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't see what he said. I don't know. But he was a legend. We all going to miss him. He's the logo, so... He was an amazing player. I wasn't born yet, but I saw some highlights. He was an amazing player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think I've made that play from beginning of the season or before the season even started. I told myself that I wanted to just maximize my defensive potential, and I wanted to make First Team All-Defense going into the season. I mean, that didn't happen, but to be able to be in these moments and show your defensive versatility, picking guys up, guarding guys in the post, guarding contested threes, switching on, it's been big for us. But we have a lot of great defenders on this team. So it's been a full team effort, but that's something I definitely took personal going from last year to this year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"No, KP didn't talk to us, but we've been playing all season and all playoffs without KP. So it wasn't any surprise for anybody. Obviously we'd love to have KP out there. We are different when he is. But X stepped in that role, and I thought he was great. Defensively I thought he was stellar, and that big shot he made in the corner, I just knew it. I just knew when I drove, they were going to help, and he was going open. And I trusted it all the way. I just knew it was going in. I don't know how to tell you. It was just like a divine experience. I knew X was going to make that shot, and he did. That was big for us. I thought X was great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was a great team win. That lead dwindled fast. I know we were up 20, and then they stormed back. And that's what the beauty of basketball is. You can never let up. It's always time, and they were able to cut the lead. But in those moments, those are the moments which you have to just live for. We've been in those moments a lot. We just needed to be patient, be poised. I feel like we got some good looks. The defensive intensity ramped up. Officiating, you know, got a little bit tighter. So at the end of the day, you've just got to make plays. I thought we got some good looks down the line in the fourth. Some went in. Some didn't. But we were able to make plays and find a way to win. And we've been in those positions, and we've lost. It was great to overcome that with my brother, Jayson, and with our team. That was special."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Luka is a great player. I'm going to start by saying that. He does a lot for their team. Offensively has the ball in his hands a lot. It's a tough lift for him. He's been tough. Even with that fourth quarter, those stats, he's still been able to pretty much get to whatever he wants. So we've just got to continue to be better, and that's all I could really say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, sometimes success can be almost not -- I don't want to say a bad thing, but just being able to finish that quarter where we were up 20. You know, start of the fourth, they came out and made some plays. I checked out around that time, and around that fourth quarter, they just stormed all the way back. But, you know, it's like that in basketball. Sometimes when you are winning, comfort kind of sets into your mind. You kind of like relax. Your brain kind of wants to go at ease, and you've got to fight that. You've got to fight that temptation to fall into that because it's still time left to be played and other teams are still competing. And I think even though that lead dwindled fast, we found ways and moments to overcome it. In that fourth quarter I was proud of, we made some big-time plays. Jrue Holiday, D-White, JT was physical, aggressive. Got to the paint, and we were able to finish it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"To answer your first question, I feel like in the first half, I feel like we had some good looks, some good reads. I was finding guys, getting to the paint, getting up into the offense. I was a little bit -- I was letting them off the hook. I felt like they were letting me just have open looks from three, and I was taking the first one and I should have been a little more patient. I was a little bit more patient in the second half of letting the game kind of come to me a little bit more. But it's awesome. I mean, I can't -- I don't even really have words. It kind of doesn't even really feel real right now. I'm just trying to stay in the moment. It feels great to be up 3-0 in the series but the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just seeing what the game is giving me and making the right play. I feel like we got a bunch of great looks. Good things happen when I get to the paint. Sometimes I don't always get to assist. Sometimes it's a hockey assist. But I just like making the defense converge. You have to respect them getting to the basket. And we have a lot of great shooters. I was committed to that all night. I feel like in the first half I could have done it more and I settled for some shots because I have like a big on me. You know, I needed to get to the paint a little bit more. And I did that in the second half, and then in the fourth quarter, and I feel like that's what helped us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"The coaching staff has been fantastic all season long. I've been saying that throughout the regular season, even before we got to the playoffs. Just it's been just super organized. We've walked through all different types of scenarios. We've been like overly prepared and making sure that we know. Sometimes it's like you've got the coaches, they game plan, but they don't always let you know exactly what they are thinking. Like, they tell us everything. Super transparent. And we trusted it. We trust it. I thought that's been great. Joe has been a big reason of that, and he showed himself in these playoffs. He's been coaching his ass off."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think definitely it's been some growth, but I think this team has trusted me, especially in this playoffs and those moments to just be who I am. I felt like I've been able to just deliver just by being just being patient and being poised. Those opportunities have presented themselves, and I've been able to take advantage of them. But I give all my credit to my teammates for the trust they had in me to have the ball in my hands and to be able to make those plays."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just being aggressive. You know, running that action with the ball in my hands to finish the third, I wanted to make sure that we got a good quality look. So if they would have overhelped, I would have been ready to kick it out. I saw that I had been making those passes in the first half, and they didn't want to give those threes up. So they kind of were in between, and when I seen that, it was lights out. So I just went up and finished it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 12, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Experience is the best teacher. All year long we've been hearing about the Celtics are the past, for the last six to eight months, that's all we've been hearing is all the different shortcomings we've had in the past. This is a new team, you know what I mean. We've learned from those experiences. And in these moments, you can see that we learned from it. We stepped up to the plate, and we found a way to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, he's a great person, a great player, and he's doing everything he possibly can to help us win and help get back with us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"No, not at all. I mean, he's just a highly competitive person, and he's doing everything he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I wouldn't say his attitude has ever changed, even when he got hurt in Miami, he still was smiling in the locker room after that. His mindset, his attitude has always stayed the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Just means someone is going to have to step up. We trust every single person on this team, and like you said, they've stepped up this whole postseason."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Whoever we put out there, we understand they might not be what KP is, but they're going to do whatever it takes to help us win games. I have just as much trust in whoever we put out there as I do in KP."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Just trying to make it difficult for him. He's obviously a great player, and just trying to make him take tough shots. We expect him to play better, so it's going to be more of a challenge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We're just trying to get a good look every time. We don't have a number we need to hit, but just go out there, making the right read, making the right pass, and just getting a good look every time down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, it's how we attack the basket, just get in the paint, crash the defense, try to make the right pass and the right read off of that. I would say that's been our offense the whole year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, every game you can learn from and just understand that it's going to get tougher each and every game. The things we did in Boston might not work this game, so just being able to make the adjustments that we need to and just trust that whatever adjustments they make, we've got an answer for it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I'm sure it's going to be crazy in here. We've just got to stick together, and I'm sure we're going to have a lot of Boston fans, too. It'll be fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Just sprinting back, trying to make a play. I don't really have a fear of getting dunked on, so that's kind of part of it. Then just trusting the instincts. Just trying to sprint back and trying to stop a basket any chance I can. I've just kind of been doing it for a while."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It's a learned experience. Over time you learn how to deal with all the extra noise and attention, whether it's positive or not so positive. You know, I'm a fair, smart person. I know when I'm doing things at a high level. I know when I need to do certain things better. So I'm not, like, oblivious to what's going on. At the same time, just keeping the main thing the main thing and focusing on trying to win the next game. That's what's most important at this time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, that's part of it, right? You never, like, completely shut a guy as talented as him out. You've heard it a million times: great players, try to make things difficult, show them different coverages, make them work for everything. They're going to make some shots. They're going to miss some shots. You just don't want it to be easy for them to be comfortable. That's with any talented player."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I'm a big Matthew fan? We went to school together. I actually watched him win last night. Trying to learn and understand the rules in the game of hockey more and more. I got to watch the game last night. They won. Like I said, I'm extremely happy for him and his family. Hopefully they win it all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think being in the Finals two years ago has helped me in this moment. Like I said, I understand that I do need to be more efficient. I do need to shoot the ball better, I would not disagree with anybody on that. But I'm not letting it bother me. I'm still trying to find ways to impact the game and dominate the game in other areas. I understand that it could take one game. One game, I could explode. All the percentages and things like that could change. So it's just that mindset of I'm one game away or whatever that means. Like I said the other day, I know what it's like to be in this position and lose. This time around, trying to do any and everything possible to have a different outcome. So, yes, I know I need to shoot the ball better. And I plan on it. Not letting that affect everything else that I need to do on the court to help us win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yes, that's one thing where I truly do appreciate Joe, aside from being I think an excellent coach, is that I truly do believe that he cares about us, our team as individuals, obviously myself, the conversations that we have. He always, through the season, the summertime, obviously through this postseason, has had days where he's called me, called me into his office. Not necessarily talk about X's and O's, but check on me as a person, how I'm dealing with everything. That does mean a lot for somebody to take time out of his day to show that compassion or whatever, just know that he's there for me. That relationship between yourself and a coach is important. That's something I truly value about the relationship that me and Joe have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, that's just another thing. I think Joe always challenges, in particular me and J.B., to find different ways to affect the game. I think J.B. has taken that up another notch of his conditioning, his ability to essentially chase down and guard guys, like I said, 90 feet from the basket. That's just another way that, obviously, besides his scoring and things like that, that he can positively impact the game that gives us the best chance to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"We're just so much of a better team when we have him. 7-4 unicorn, right? He's as talented as they come. Presents so many matchup problems on the offensive end. Then on the defensive end, somebody that can affect shots, protect the rim as well as he does. So, yes, we've had success and found ways to win without him. Obviously, we're better when he's on the team, when he's out there playing with us. Obviously, he's day to day, doing everything he can to get out there and give us whatever he can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to put us in the predicament where it's like I'm shooting not as well, still we can win. I want to shoot the ball well. But I feel I just keep saying it. That's not the only thing that I bring to the table, not being defined by that. Earlier in my career, I was a score the ball and rebound type of guy. How much I've grown and developed as a player, reading the game, understanding what the defense is trying to take away, giving up. It's such a long season that you're not going to make every shot. You're not going to shoot as well as you would like to. The guys that I've studied, the best of the best players, have always just found a way. That's just all I've been trying to do, is find a way to do whatever I can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think that's very good. It's how we come out for Game 3. Got to be the more desperate team. I think if we take care of business and really come out with a purpose, we'll be all right."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,For sure. We're looking forward to it. We like playing on the road. It'll be a good environment to play in.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Definitely.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Well, I didn't go straight to the scorer's table, but I did get Joe's attention or Charles' attention, too, and then they told me get in. I guess you could kind of say I did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"For sure. I think I’ve earned that right a little bit to show that I'm able to take those shots, even if they were very difficult. I don't care about my shooting percentage as far as that. I could have been 0 for 9 if I missed that. But that could have been the difference, and who knows from here on out. Maybe that helps me jump start to make the next couple."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I don't practice them, but I just look at them, and I don't know, I probably zone in more on them. Just like clock is winding down, and you've got nothing to lose."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It's special for sure, just the energy the crowd had got us jump started us to start the fourth well. Built momentum. Yeah, those are moments you live for on this type of stage, so that was big time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I probably blacked out a little bit, but like I said, it's just moments that you dream of, of hitting shots like that with the clock winding down. Hopefully I can continue to do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Al is in the middle of watching Game of Thrones right now, so a lot of us have seen that. I just re-watched Yellowstone with my fiance and my brother for the third time, so I went through and watched that, also. I love that show."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"What happened? I mean, the tweet that we put out was pretty explanatory. It's kind of a random situation. I felt something, and now I have to deal with it. As we said, yeah, it's going to be day-to-day, and I'll see how I am tomorrow, and obviously I'm going to do everything I can to be out there tomorrow, and we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I am, of course. I have to be. I'm optimistic, and as I said, I will do everything I can to be out there tomorrow. Yeah, we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know. I don't know the specifics. But that's something I'll leave in the medical staff's hands to determine whether I can go or no. But from my side, as I said, nothing is going to stop me unless I'm told I'm not allowed to play. That's the only reason I would not be out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, I don't care. I've been through some stuff in my career, and obviously this is a rough patch coming back and having something happen right away again. It's tough. It's very -- just a tough moment right now. But I'm feeling pretty good. I'm feeling pretty good. Mind is good. We'll see tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know. It was kind of a random situation. It wasn't like I was limping or something I did before this. I was good, and then this happened. I don't think it's anything related, and I don't know, either. The medical staff would know better. It is what it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I'm living by those words. Of course."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, I hope not, but if it comes to that to win, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I was going for a rebound at the free throw line. Just kind of pushed in Lively's back and we bumped knees and something happened. I just kept playing for a while after that. Obviously towards the end my movement was affected a bit. Joe took me out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Some black magic, no? No, I'm joking. No, the first time I came back, I was not playing that game, I was with Washington, and I had a warm welcome here. They even did a tribute video, which was very unexpected for me, but that was very nice. I think the organization, the people on the inside appreciated my time here, and that was very nice. Obviously, I have completely no bad feeling about this place. I love this city, love the fans, and it just didn't work out. I definitely don't expect a comeback like I had in New York. But we'll see tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's pretty close. I think because of the type of player that he is, it's always going to look different because of his versatility."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"That's probably why you asked that question. None of the American ones did. They look at the lens differently of basketball. In America, nothing is ever good enough. It's about what can you do for me right now. It's not always the case in that situation. Yes, I think we are. I think he's only going to get better. He makes greatness look easy because of his ability to impact the game in many different ways. He's going to continue to get better and better and better. It's an honor to coach him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, listen, he's doing anything and everything he can to be ready for the game tomorrow. It's a serious injury. At the end of the day, our team and the medical team is not going to put him in any bad situations. We've taken the decision to play out of his hands because the importance of him. He's going to do everything can he to play. We're going to leave it up to our medical team. That's really it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the growth of him as a player has been, like, not being defined by one thing. When you have your superstar players knowing what it takes to win, they're willing to take that on. Sometimes it's scoring. Sometimes it's defense. Sometimes it's rebounding, passing, executing. I think one of the major growths of Jalen's game is he'll do whatever it takes to win. That could change each game. That could change each series. He's doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"What he would say? He would say, Focus on the details, focus on the fundamentals. The closer you are to winning, the easier it is to become distracted by things that you can't control, things that don't matter. Here are the things that matter, and you got to fight like hell to accomplish those things with simplicity, with discipline and mental toughness. Everything he talked about was about your mindset and your mental toughness. That's what separates you. Thank you for asking the second question. I think it's the most important thing. I think the ability to handle the ebbs and flows, the humility to understand there's a plan that's much bigger than who you are individually. Have an impact on other people. Then using the gifts God has given you to try to impact people. It's my anchor, the most important thing. I've enjoyed the challenge of trying to stick with that even when it's difficult at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I think he's missed some easy shots. I expect him obviously to be even more aggressive and to fight to get those shots. The most important thing is just being detailed in individual defense. It's not about shutting him down. It's about just making it difficult for him because of his ability to impact plays. So we just have to fight for that. He's gotten some good looks. I think we have to guard him better. He's definitely going to be more aggressive. We have to be better at individual defense. We have to be better at our team defense. We have to be better at our details.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think the biggest thing is when you get someone and you realize that everything everybody says about them is true, that's probably one of the ultimate compliments you can get. Your character is what it is. It's what you say it is, what other people say it is. I'd say that. Everything everyone said about him when we first got him, it's been even better. Just the type of person that he is. His humility, his competitive nature, the way he treats his family, the way he treats his teammates, how hard he plays, his willingness to do everything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I didn't see it. It is out of his hands. It's his job to fight like hell to put himself in the best possible position to feel as good as he can. We're not going to let him compromise himself. That's been it. To say, We need you, do everything you can, but at the end of the day we got your back and make sure we put you in the best position possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I have no idea.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Criticism is the ultimate beauty. It's a sign of ultimate respect. It's just a beautiful thing. I really love the way Jayson has handled that. It's just a testament to who he is. Shot selection is all about timing. It just depends on the time and score, depends on the spacing, the type of play we ran to get the shot that we want. Nobody knows what's a good shot and what's not except the people in our locker room, because those are the ones that we talk about every single day. We know how important shot selection is. I think the greatest strength of our team is they fight to take the right shot every single time down the floor. They know what a right shot is. They know the importance of how the shot will impact your defense. It will impact or offense. On that particular shot, that was a good shot because we were in offensive rebounding position, the floor was balanced, we had the matchup that we wanted. It allowed us to do both: to offensive rebound and get back in transition. I think you just try to learn, try to look at different lenses. I think everybody tries to look at the game the same way. The more you can look at it from a completely different spectrum, it allows you to build connections. It allows you to really focus on where games are really won and lost, and not on the stuff that's easy to notice. I think everyone notices the easy things. It's can you fight to notice the things other people aren't, because you know that's where winning and losing is, is in that space."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Try to use different things to keep the guys engaged. It's a long year. If you keep talking to them about game plans, it gets stagnant. You try to build connections. You figure out what's one thing that can grab the guys' attention for an extra 10 seconds, something outside of basketball that you think can hammer home a point. At the end of the day, that's the most important thing, is making sure you get through to your guys so they listen."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I try to be like peers with all of our guys. The age gap is relatively there. I try to have a peer-like relationship with all of them. Then with each guy it's different, because you can break down different barriers -- who is married, who has kids, whose faith is important. Sometimes it's not for people. So you connect differently. I've always had an interesting relationship with Jrue because we share the same app, the Hallow app. Before I met him, he was actually on there. I would listen to his prayers. I got to know his heart. Then I coached him in the All-Star Game. I always had this spiritual connection that we would end up in the same area at some point. I kind of felt like I knew him before I knew him just because of the way he prays, and I knew his heart. Our relationship now is -- sometimes we talk to each other, sometimes we don't. Sometimes we just give a head nod. Sometimes I see his wife, I give them a hug; sees my wife, give them a hug. That's it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"You're talking about football, okay. I just want to see if I got you right. I think Neymar has handled the most pressure lately. But because we had a lack of idols most recently. If you are back in 2002, we had Ronaldo, had Rivaldo. We had a great national team. This talent has gone down for the years. Neymar has surged like a huge talent. We put a lot of expectations on him that he can deliver to us another World Cup. I don't think it's pretty fair to him what we did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I agree. I would say the same thing for Tatum. Also, he's the first No. 10 to take on the weight of Brazil since the social media era. Who before Neymar was involved in that social media area? He's so good, everything you can do can be taken for granted. When he won the gold medal by making the game-winning penalty kick, you would have thought that would have solidified it. It hasn't."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Most recently, yes. I have a particular opinion, but I have to see the general thing about it, about Neymar. I don't agree of a lot of his actions outside the field."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know him. All I know is the soccer player.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,We should just focus on the soccer player. I don't think that's fair.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Don't get me into the coaches. I mean, don't get me into the football coaches, right? That's like an impossible job."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"It's a lot of pressure. It's a huge country. We love football, we love soccer. It's our sport. We were always good at it. It's a lot of pressure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,Most recently the results were so bad that the pressure is just rising.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I study that a lot because I think we're in a similar environment here as to how to handle all of that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"Boston Celtics, probably just from the basketball, as great as the national soccer team. Pretty much the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,I know you love soccer.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",BRAZILIAN REPORTER,"I know you like (Pep) Guardiola, and I know you stole some things from his thoughts."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,None of us are that good. We steal from everybody.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Defend the house. When we went out there, we were trying to do what we could. We couldn't get the two wins, couldn't get a win. All right, cool, move on, next play, next game. Now we've just got to bring a different energy, a different light and a different positivity coming into Game 3."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY ii,"Just really getting out in pace. I feel like whenever they slow us down and we end up playing one-on-one, we can't get into our pick-and-roll game because the defense was pulled in and they're expecting it. But whenever we are out in transition, I set a high screen at half court, and Tatum doesn't know if he's going to step up or Porzingis doesn't know if he's going to step up, that's the game we need to get into. Just being able to move the ball, get out and run and make sure that we're not so stagnant with the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It's just understanding the defensive principles. Instead of me protecting the paint, it's me rotating to either wing or rotating to the corner. It's just understanding where you are on the floor, understanding if you see where you need to rotate, it's getting there. There was one time Jaylen Brown cut, I was supposed to rotate corner. I thought he was there, but he was at the rim. It's just always moving your head, keeping your head on a swivel and understanding where you are and who's in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"They're going to be loud. I honestly didn't think it was that loud. There was a bunch of rumors about how Boston is going to be so loud, so nasty. I thought it was going to be worse. So just knowing that, it just makes you want to go out there and perform in front of your own crowd."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Come out there, punch them in the mouth. I feel like we were doing a great job of guarding them, a great job of just going shot for shot with them the majority of the game. A lot of the game just came down to us not being as sound on the defensive end in the fourth quarter, us making free throws and us being able to take care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like whenever you're in games like this, you find out who you really are. You understand what you really want out of this, who you really are, just understanding that whenever you're on the bench, you're here, your teammates just lock into the game. There's nothing else going on in the world that can take your focus away from what's going on in the Finals. There's no other feeling you want to be in and no other place you want to be in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"You know, it's kind of hard to make sure I don't slip up and say anything too inappropriate. But I'm just out there trying to make sure my people hear me. Everybody on the team knows that if I'm mic'd up, making sure you don't say anything too crazy to me. But they know I'm going to talk to them on the defensive side, talk to them on the offensive side, and even if they fall down, I'm picking them back up and giving them positive words of encouragement."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, I feel like they keep coming back to me because they like what they're getting, so I'm going to continue to put on a show, continue to do what I do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just continue to be aggressive. Try to win each possession. Try to win the little battles -- the rebounding game, the diving on the floor, the loose balls, all the little things are going to come down to a win. It's not just the big shots. It's not just the big plays. It's the little plays that are going to give us the boost to give us the extra steps that we need so we can get a breath of fresh air."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",Maxi Kleber,"Like any other time, you have to make sure you stay composed. It’s a long series and you want to make sure you play the right way and play your game and don’t get affected by outside noise."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think it’s not about any individual person. I think it’s overall on the offensive side, creating the space so Kyrie and Luka have it a little easier to create shots for themselves and for us. So we just have to make sure we have the right spacing and putting guys in position to succeed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, but even if not, Ky makes great decisions for us. Even if he has an off shooting night or whatever, it doesn’t mean that he played bad for us. We know he has a high IQ, but we can give him a little more space to get some easy ones to create a rhythm."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"It’s the Finals and you try to take away a lot of things. You contest every shot and make it harder on both sides for both teams. If we have the right spacing and involve the right guys, we can get the shots that we want."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"We have to take the energy from all the fans and bring it to the court. Come out with the right attitude and get the win. If you’re at home, you have to take advantage of it, just like Boston did."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think he's one of the best players in the world. You're trying to just make it tough. That's all you can do, is hopefully guard the first move, guard the second move, guard the third move and contest. Guys are doing that at a high rate, trying to make it tough on him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought Exum did a great job in Game 2. We'll look to see if we can get that combination out there a little bit more as a third ball handler. Defensively, I thought he did a really good job. He's one of the few that has made a three in this series. He knocked down the open three. We're going to need that a little bit more from him. I thought the pace he came with was really good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at their defense, just understanding -- I thought Luka did a great job of getting off to a great start scoring. It's just understanding who's on and who he's involving in the pick-and-roll. We have to do a little bit better job of that. Again, he's getting where he wants to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"That's what they say. We're home. Understanding that Boston held serve, that's what we're talking about, is just focusing on Game 3. We felt in Game 2 we had opportunities we just let get away from us. For us at home, protecting home court. But the cliché is role players play better at home, so we'll see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It's easy, just say relax. I think the urgency started for us awhile back. I think we're used to that. I think the game of basketball is about makes and misses and capitalizing on mistakes. We just haven't had that opportunity to capitalize. We're getting stops. We're turning the ball over, give up a three. Understand coming down the stretch we had to play perfect. Hopefully the game is close coming down the stretch and we can capitalize on their mistakes. But there's two teams playing, so we can relax and enjoy this and have fun. That's what it's all about. Hopefully we can do that tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"You look at White and Holiday are comfortable -- Holiday is very comfortable in the dunker. He plays as the big. Being able to not just put the ball in the basket, but also to be a playmaker from that position. He's a willing passer. When you talk about a point guard or a versatile guard, those two can playmake from there. So they put a lot of pressure. It's a little different when you have smalls in the dunker. For us, we had to do a little bit better job of understanding who is down there. Again, Boston is a very talented team when you talk about the four around one. They have four shooters on the perimeter. They can playmake. They're very willing passers. Sometimes in this league you've got to give up something. Right now, they're taking advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JASON KIDD,"This is an incredible atmosphere. To win that championship in 2011, the city is incredible. They love their Mavs. To win it then and now to be here in '24 is special because you don't really get an opportunity to do that. I understand the opportunity that I have to be the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. It's a dream come true. But we're trying right now to figure out how to win one game, and that's the next one tomorrow night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I've been saying it all year: failure is the best teacher at times. It can inspire you to do great things. It's our first time being in the Finals as a team with this group. We understand who we're up against, the competitive level, the nature of the Finals, the competitive level we have to play at. Also, the adjustments that we have to make out there on the floor just as players. The coaching staff is doing a great job of preparing us. But it's our job as players to make those adjustments and play even harder, especially when the game is getting a little out of balance, we have a lead and we want to extend it a little bit. A lot of it is just a learning curve for myself, for my teammates, and also a peace of mind that we give each other that we want to give ourselves a chance by leaving it all out there on the floor, playing our best, preparing the best way we can. That's literally been the focus since Game 2 ended, was putting our best foot forward, coming back home, feeling familiar, letting our game speak for itself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"First thing of that is just accepting that I haven't played well or up to my standards, as well as I would have liked. Being back in Boston, there's such a level of desire that I have inside of me to play well. Wanted to be there for my teammates. As a competitor, it's frustrating. But I don't want to let that seep in or spill over to any other decisions I have to make there as a player. Continue to feed my teammates' confidence. Have been down 0-2 before -- lost a series, won a series. I know what it takes. Also how to prepare for something, like, that mentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically. First is just respecting your opponent, then most importantly putting your best foot forward out there when we go out there. It's as simple as that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"He's been playing great. He's been one of the emotional leaders on the team. Defensively he's making it difficult. That's what he's been doing all year. For the past few years, he's tried to make his mark on that end."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, Games 1 and 2 is about our total team effort, how we can control a lot of the mistakes we made out there, whether it be turnovers, obviously the missed shots are going to happen. That's a basketball game. I can be a lot more fundamentally sound, technical on my shots, not get into the paint often where it's three or four guys around me, I'm not making a pass. They're sending specific strategies against me to make it difficult. We're at the highest stage in the world. It's a small sample size. We only get a seven-game series potentially. I just can feel the stakes being raised up a little bit more. The pressure is natural. Makes diamonds. For us as a team, we just have to control what we can control on that end. Being able to match their pace, but also feel good about ourselves when we get stops. When we get stops, get out in transition, we're a better team. When we're getting stops and giving up offensive rebounds or we're getting stops and turning the ball over, it hurts our chances to even be in the game. The margin of their victories hasn't really displayed the full story in terms of the Celtics beating us. We just have to continue to lean in on each other, especially when it gets tough out there. We're going against a great team. They're not going to stop pressing us, stop their pace, stop testing us on both ends of the floor. We know what we're in for. But now we have to raise it to an even higher level, and it starts with me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Sharing with them that it took a lot of resilience. It took a lot of will to win in 2016. That's also a different team. We had time to fail together. We had time to go through our trials together. We lost in 2015. A lot of guys came back in 2016 and we won. So there was an inner motivation there. We also knew who we were going against, how well they played. I think if you have a healthy way or perspective of looking at where we are now, it feels like we are that team that's gaining the experience, that's being able to fail at this level. Now we have an opportunity to respond. That's all you can ask for in a basketball season. If you asked me in September or October, would I want a chance to be down 0-2 and having a chance to respond in Game 3 or be out of the Playoffs, I think I would choose the former. It's as simple as that in terms of putting it in perspective. We're the only teams left. This is about chess. That's all it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think it starts with just being aware of your own goals, what you want to accomplish, your team goals, how you can help accomplish that. Also what's going to bring you peace of mind off the court when you leave it. Some of us would say family, video games, other business entrepreneurial opportunities. Just helping you have a healthy balance with the game. The game is going to be a game. It's going to torment you emotionally. You're going to fail, succeed, make shots, miss shots. You want to be able to go home to a great family, people that love you unconditionally, those that are going to be truthful with you. I'm grateful I've been able to build a tribe around me that has all those. Dealing with a lot of the criticism, when you're young, even when you're older, how to accomplish something like I'm trying to do right now, there's going to be a lot of people that want to see you fail. Get used to that too. There are going to be a lot of people that are going to be naysaying, want to see you kind of destroy yourself in the process. I would say just focus on the people that really love you for you. Your teammates are there to support you, especially when you know them throughout. Then trusting the people that have been there before you. They'll give you a lot of advice to help you reason or rationalize what's going on. That's a great question, brother. It took me awhile to figure that out and find that peace of mind. That's why you get a chance to see me up there. I definitely want to see you accomplish that peace of mind a lot earlier than I had to. It's not worth it to let anybody's opinions get to the best of you. Or people that have never been in our position don't know what it takes, don't know the sacrifices, never will, but they guess, and they try to make it up. Show them respect, but at the same time understand that we're all human at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it started with me just telling my hermano I got to play better for him, alongside him. In order for us to accomplish our goal, we both have to be playing well and we both have to be doing the little things, doing whatever it takes to win. Easy conversation. But it started with me reaching out, just letting him know it's my fault, taking accountability for not playing particularly well. But also I got to continue to trust my guys around us or around me. I need to have fun in the process. We've gotten this far because we've been a great team, not because we've just put it on me and Luka. It's been a total team, organizational effort to get this far. We just got to keep trusting in that. Pretty simple conversation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Rather win (smiling).
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, we definitely have had some moments of positivity on the defensive end where we've gotten the missed shots. Again, I just remember one play that comes to mind, where potentially we could be down six. Pritchard hits a three going into the fourth quarter where it gives a little bit more breathing room to have the game in their hands. Just being aware of some of the plays that they're going to try to make at the end of quarters, the plays they make at the start of the game to get them going a little bit, the plays they run when we're in the lead. We've had the lead in the first quarter -- 12-6, 13-6 both times. We're feeling good about ourselves, and they come out and run the same play four times in a row. Our IQ has to be at a higher level. Also, our communication and trust has to be at an ultimate level where we can just trust our instincts out there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,I just know he’s going to do everything he can to get on the floor. Hoping for the best.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,Let’s see. We’ll see how everything goes. Just have to wait and see if he is going to play or not. I feel like we have plenty of guys who should be able to come in and help contribute. We just have to wait.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,"He feels pretty good. From what I’ve seen, he seems pretty optimistic. For him, we’re just wishing that he is going to do everything he can to get himself going. Anything that he can give us, we’ll appreciate it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",AL HORFORD,"For us, it’s just continuing to do what we’ve been doing all year. Being consistent on the defensive end. On offense, playing the way we want to play. Just being consistent. Our team has been this all season. Now we have a great opportunity in Game 3 to come in here. We understand it’s not going to be easy. It’s going to be a tough game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Trying to be the hungrier team. We're going to go out there and try and execute a game plan, and I think most of us just try and do it together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP is tough. Whatever decision he makes is his decision. But he's a tough guy. Obviously whatever decision he makes, I'm supportive of it. But that's mostly up to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"KP always has a great attitude. That's something you don't have to worry about. He's just like this joy and this light. Anytime he walks into a room, no matter what's going on, he brings that every time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's team defense. We do it as a team. It's not just one person, it's everybody. We just try to defend him, we try to show him bodies, multiple people, and just try to make it difficult."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think we still have spacers. I think we try to do our best to get into the right spacing or get into the right positions and try to do as best we can.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's hard. I've sacrificed a lot. I've missed out on a lot of my kids' stuff just to be here. But the journey is cool, and I think just the friends and the family that I've met along the way has made it worth it, and the fact that my family is here with me makes it even more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"You've got to talk to him. I can only imagine. It would be tough, right? Missing a lot of the Playoffs and then coming to the Finals and then getting hurt at the end, it would be hard. But KP is a tough guy, and he knows himself very, very well. Again, like I said, he's been bringing this energy and this positivity that he's just always brought, this light, and he'll continue to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,I think that's been here. I think that trust has been here. That chemistry has been here. We just embodied it from the beginning. That wasn't anything that had to grow over time. That just came naturally.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's not any different. I did it in Milwaukee, too. I'm not really sure people actually knew that but there's a lot of time being in the dunker and trying to space the floor and have the best spacing, but I think for this team, me down there trying to make plays out of the dunker a lot of the time helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Getting the ball to JT and JB. The way they've been playing, the way they've been touching the paint and getting to the basket has been huge for us, and one of the reasons why we had such a good game last game. Again, I think JT driving and attracting two or three people and collapsing the defense has made our offense a lot easier."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,All I know is that he is working his butt off to try to be ready to go for tomorrow. That’s really all I know.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I think that is the beauty of our team. We’re friends off the court as well as on the court. Not every team you’re on is like that. Every guy gets along with each other. Dach guy individually has his own personality, but it all kind of works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"He obviously poses a lot of different threats for us and the other team. We’d love to have him out there, but if he can’t go, everybody just has to step up. We’ve shown we can do it throughout the Playoffs when he’s not there to play, but obviously we’re really hoping he can play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",SAM HAUSER,We just have to be laser focused. I think the biggest challenge is being on the road. Dealing with the fans. Players are usually more comfortable on their home court. We just have to come out and be ready to go.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"It’s a must-win for us. We need to come out aggressive and deliver the first punch and make sure we’re ready to go as a team. As far as adjustments, I think we need to be a lot better at just overall. Offensively, we’ve been awful. We know we need to be better. We know what we need to do. It’s just about us doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah. The guys are definitely excited to come back to Dallas. We’ve been on the road now for a week. Coming home and getting the energy from the crowd, I think it’s only going to help us. I think we’re really looking forward to that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think every single game in every single playoff series is a must-win. But I think for this, we have to win this game. That’s the intent going into this game; it’s a must-win game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Coach has been good because obviously he has been in this position before and knows what it’s like as a player, too. Obviously, he has had his message and he’s been able to get that across to the team. In saying that, he has also done a great job of being able to hear the players’ opinions and how we feel like we can fix things. So I think it’s been a mixture of both. But obviously I think it comes down to aggression and just having trust and confidence in one another."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"We need to make them. It’s obviously frustrating not making them, but at the same time, we need to make sure we’re taking every opportunity, even if we are missing. At the end of the day, it’s going to get better. We’re not going to keep missing. It’s been a big emphasis. We’ve been shooting a lot, getting extra reps in. We know what we’re capable of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"We’ve been shooting great throughout the Playoffs. I think it’s an adjustment. A little bit of jitters in the first game. It’s one of those things now, it’s do or die. We need to make those shots. That’s just how it is."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, I mean, it feels great just to be back on the home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much with me, just the same as coming out from the last game: setting the tone physically. Just come out with energy, match everything that they're throwing at us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"The only thing I would say they're probably doing differently is just 1 through 5, switching on every screen-and-roll. But we've found ways to get around that. Of course we want to get a lob every now and then, but we can find other options on the floor besides lobs. It's always good because we have a lot more weapons in our arsenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Just have patience. Not necessarily letting them speed us up and then find the loopholes when it comes to their defense.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like everything matters when it comes to just like being in the Finals in general. Free throws are big, like you said. Making more shots, of course. But like I said, just stay patient with the game, let stuff come to us and not let us get sped up when it comes to what we want on the floor offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"It's a blessing to be in a situation like this, coming from the situation that I was in. Just that next step in my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like a segment of some stint of the last game, we found ways to be able to do that. We have to make them take the shots that we want. Once we get to that point and we can do it consistently, I feel like that's when we can make them uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just believe in him. Find ways to get him downhill. At the end of the day, just try to keep him as motivated as possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, it's been a minute, in all honesty, just to have a post-up play for me, for sure, so it is new to me. Most definitely it's just something that me, J-Kidd, anybody else on the team that has seen it, if we see anybody down there when it comes to like a mismatch, I always throw it down there and we can just play out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, for sure. The whole team is helping me. Everybody is having fun because at the end of the day it's the NBA Finals. There are going to be challenges. There's going to be obstacles. There's going to be adversity. We find ways to get through that as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I feel like it's going to be the same. I always loved just coming here and playing with the home crowd involved. I heard it's a sold-out game tomorrow, so hopefully it's going to blow the roof off, most definitely. They should hear us on the other side of Texas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I think that the biggest thing is we know they're going to collapse when we drive, so I think the biggest thing for me and what we've talked about is playing off two feet, whether that's a lay-up, going aggressive, or knowing that they're going to collapse and finding open shots. That's the biggest thing going into this game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, I'm a guy that no matter the situation in any game, I'm always going to try and put up that shot. Like it happened that other game, I think it was an important basket for them, kind of cut the momentum a little bit going into the quarter. But yeah, I think a lot of the times it's shots that we practice a little bit, and I think we're good enough players to make it. He obviously got lucky on that one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I've hit a few. I've hit a few. Mine are mostly deep, past half court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, actually last year, I actually kind of went through a thing with one of my teammates about kind of a process of what I would do to shoot, and I think he was kind of a launch type, and I'm a shoot. I'll stop off two and kind of shoot and aim it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, obviously they're a team that shoots a lot of threes, and I think the biggest thing for us is making sure that they're all contested. To our credit, they didn't shoot the ball as well. But I think credit to Live and Gafford; they're playing in a role where they have to defend out on the perimeter, but as much as we can get them back to the basket, we will."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, I think they have enough guys talking to them. I think it's a lot of process. We've been watching a lot of film and making sure. But I'm confident in their ability."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"No, I think some people get lost in the emotion of everything, and yeah, you have to kind of remind guys to, hey, I'm mic'd up. But I think it's just the moment and everything. Even mic'd up or not, I think guys, we're going to say what we want to say. But I'm always pretty calm, so I won't say too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"First, I feel good. I don't want to get in any more details. But I feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I think it's up a notch, for sure. Both teams played a lot of games throughout the season. But I think the physicality has been on point, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I would say it's different. Just being 18 and 25 is a big difference. But it's different games. Here, you play first to four. In the EuroLeague, it's just one game. It's way different. I wouldn't just say that game prepared me for now. It's throughout my career that prepared me for these moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I saw him before when I started driving. I saw him at that spot. So when I went for the layup, I saw him, I knew he was going to be open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Very helpful. He can dribble the ball. He can play point guard. He can help us both. Save our energy. He can just bring the ball up. He can make plays, too. It's good that he was able to play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, our defense built in five guys. Our low man is very important. So no matter who is the low man, we know we going to do a great job. We've worked on this the whole season, preseason. I've been in that position a lot with the low man. We've been working on it since preseason. We feel confident with that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just one thing: Keep shooting. We all believe in those shots. That's how we came to the Finals. That's how we played the whole season. We believe in those guys. Everybody believes. If you're open, just keep shooting. You're going to knock it down at some point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just trying to keep getting open looks. I think our defense has not been bad. We can't really score. That's our main problem right now. But I think we getting some great looks. Like I say, we have confidence everybody can make a shot shooting the ball on our team. We just got to keep believing in it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"You could say that. I like to pride myself that I always try to play with that fire and that passion. I feel like that's what makes me who I am, the essence of why I play and how I play. But my experiences, the heartbreaks, the losses, have all kind of cultivated into what you see now. I don't want to feel that again. I think that's fair to say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It's been fun. Personally, I think it's been necessary. I think anytime you want to achieve something great, it's going to take a little bit of sacrifice from every individual to get to where you want to go. Me going into this season, I knew that being one of the leaders, that would be in front of me on my plate. I didn't mind it. It's translated to us being here in the Finals. The sacrifice is necessary not just in sports but in life, if you want to achieve a goal, to some degree."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"For me, it's different for every individual, but it's almost like you got to trick your mind almost in a sense. You almost got to play like you're down 0-2 rather than up. That's hard to do. You got to go into that mind frame, that focus. Now we are playing like that, rather than you let comfort, you let some of those things kind of seep in. You just try to stay focused and try to harness the mind as much as you can. The mind is a powerful thing. It's hard to grasp some of those things as you are intaking them. If you can kind of focus your mind on what you want it to focus on, you'd be surprised what you can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Gotten to know Jrue a lot. Jrue is, like I described it in the beginning of the season, he's like an assassin. He just has a will and a might about him, how he plays, that he'll die on the battlefield. I'm the same. You recognize that and you respect that. His will is unbreakable. He's going to show up. He's going to be there. He's going to be in the fight with you. I've been against him on the other side, so you could feel it. You could feel like this dude's not going anywhere. I think that's where the respect for me and him, just being opponents, but now him being on the same team, it's an honor. It's been an honor to be his teammate because of how he carries himself. His willingness to sacrifice, his willingness to adapt, and then be successful where he's adapting to. For example, this year was different than last year. He's like mastered being a corner three-point shooter. He wasn't that at any other point in his career. He took the role on this new team and developed into almost a new player. I don't overlook stuff like that. I think those are forms of greatness. Even though we expect greatness to be these things that are so large or so captivating. Stuff like that doesn't go unnoticed to guys like me. It's been an honor to be his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"For sure. Team camaraderie, you're going to experience this, it's probably the hardest thing to gain in the NBA. A bunch of guys, a bunch of egos. Agents telling them one thing; they feel another way. Having everybody on the same page is probably going to be the hardest thing you're going to be trying to experience throughout your career. I think it always starts from the top. Like, you look at the top guys. Me and JT, we've been here the longest, and we set the tone from the jump. Everybody else kind of has to follow along. That's kind of what has worked for us. Every locker room, every organization, is a little different. You got to figure out how to get your team into that same vibe. It's hard enough to get two people on the same page. Trying to get 12 or 15, all the way bought in, there's going to be some challenges. That's where leadership step in. As you develop as a leader, those are the type of things that you learn. You improve, you build relationships with guys, you talk to guys on the court, off the court, they start to trust you. That's how you start to build some of those good habits. But it don't happen overnight, I'll tell you that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 11, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Same old, same old. KP has been tremendous for our group, not just in the Playoffs, but all season long. It's obvious him on the floor just helps elevate us to a different level. But we've been priding ourselves on next-man-up mentality. We prepare for these moments to be able to play with or without anyone. It just requires somebody else on our team to step up and everybody to buy in to get a full team victory."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, just sprinting back, trying to make a play. Obviously they were making a little run there and whatever means necessary, just sprint back and meet him at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, I think my first three steps is really important. Just kind of put my head down and run. Then at that time just trust the instincts and trust the timing that I have. So, just putting my head down and sprinting just as fast as I can just to get in position and go up and make a play."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Every game is different. Every game is officiated a little differently. So whatever it takes you just got to make adjustments. I think both teams are just trying to figure it out, especially early, and then I just competing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"That's what Payton Pritchard does. If you watch us late clock, he doesn't shy away from that moment. That was a big-time shot, kind of got us momentum. You just love Payton. You love competing with him. It was a big-time shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think a lot of credit just goes to the type of people they are. They have done so much. I can't begin to talk about how thankful and grateful I am for Jrue just kind of allowing me to kind of take that next step. He could easily have came in and be, like, I'm Jrue Holiday, and I'm like, You are Jrue Holiday, a hundred percent (laughing). But he kind of just did a little different than what he's done the last few years and just each game getting more comfortable. KP, the same way. Just love being teammates with both of them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, the whole year the strength of this team has been one through however many guys we got. We trust whoever goes in the game and those guys just work so hard. Every time anybody checks in the game, they just give us great minutes. So we trust everybody, and everybody is making big plays for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, that's why I got dunked on earlier. But it's part of the game. I think just that not afraid to get dunked on allows me to get some that maybe some other people wouldn't have gotten. So just trying to make a play, just believing in my abilities and what I can do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, that experience, that just championship DNA, which you hear all about all the time. You don't really know what it takes until you do what it takes. Just the moment he came to our team in training camp, he kind of just had that presence about him. He just knows how to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DAVID FOGEL,"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are excited to be in Boston for Game 2 of the NBA Finals and to present the 2024 Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award. On behalf of Coaches Association President Rick Carlisle and all of our great NBA head and assistant coaches, I would like to thank Commissioner Silver, Mark Tatum, Kathy Behrens, Mike Bass, Byron Spruell, Michael Levine, Tim Frank, Paul Benedict, Mark Broussard and the entire NBA for all of the league support and assistance in providing this platform to honor the extraordinary achievements of our great NBA coaches. We are especially proud of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award, which honors the memory of Hall of Famer Chuck Daly, who over an outstanding career set the standard for integrity, competitive excellence and tireless promotion of NBA basketball. Chuck was an incredible mentor to so many coaches and players in our league, including Coach Carlisle and Coach Tomjanovich. With that, I would like to turn it over to Coach Carlisle. Thank you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"Thanks, David. Adam, thanks again. This is just such a wonderful opportunity each year to honor basketball royalty."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",I first want to thank our selection committee,"Bernie Bickerstaff, Billy Cunningham, Joe Dumars, Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Pat Riley, Donnie Walsh and Lenny Wilkens. These eight committee members have been with us through the 16-year history of this. I think this is our 17th year. The winners of this award over the years, it began here in 2009. The first Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award winner was Tom Heinsohn, who was the guy that originated the Coaches Association back in the early '70s, followed by Jack Ramsay, Tex Winter, Lenny Wilkens, Pat Riley, Bill Fitch, Bernie Bickerstaff, Dick Motta, K.C. Jones, Jerry Sloan, Al Attles, Hubie Brown, Frank Layden, Del Harris, Larry Brown, Mike Fratello, Rick Adelman and, of course, Rudy this year. Of all the recipients that we've had for this award, I don't think we've ever had someone whose profile was so similar to Chuck Daly's himself. Both Rudy and Chuck were back-to-back NBA championship winners. They both were Olympic gold medalist coaches. Interestingly, Rudy one-upped Chuck a little bit. He has a media cooperation award named after him that was established in 2011. And Rudy told me it used to be the Chuck Daly/Rudy Tomjanovich Award, and somehow it just shifted and now it's only Rudy. So that's pretty cool. But both Chuck and Rudy are guys that were beloved, unconditionally respected within the coaching profession, and guys that were able to get the very, very best out of a wide range of different kind of players and were so great and made so many people feel special and made the players that they coached feel special. I want to recognize Sam Cassell, who is in the back. Sam was, I think, on both back-to-back teams in Houston. Hit the big shot against New York the first year, I remember that, in the Garden. He'll be coaching tonight. We tried to see if he can come out on the court for us for the award ceremony, but he's got a job to do over there so we can't pry him away. But appreciate you being here. Rudy also authored one of the great postgame comments in NBA history. I want to make sure I get this right: ""Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion."" So it gives me great pleasure, great privilege to introduce Rudy Tomjanovich as this year's recipient of the Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Thank you very much. I want to thank Rick, David and the Coaches Association for this honor, the guys on that selection committee. If you had a poll of my favorite guys, all those coaches. The great thing about this award is it came to me out of the blue. I had no idea I was up for this. I happened to be with my son up in Houston when I got the call and Rick started telling me about it. I got emotional. My son kept asking, ""Are you okay? Are you okay?"" Then he told me what the award stood for, and finally I hung up, and I told him, ""No, everything's great."" And then I did cry. The reason is, when something like this happens, I'm not thinking about the championships. I'm not thinking about all the good stuff. I'm thinking about the dark days, the days when I doubted myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,That's pressure.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"And he said, ""I promise you, I will give you everything I've got."" And he did. Now, a little bit got lost in the translation because he's really country and I'm really city. He would say some words like ""yonder"" and stuff like that. But we came up with a system for the players we had, and that's my philosophy as a coach. You don't keep the same plays every year; you change it for the talent you have. And of course we had Hakeem Olajuwon. I would not be here if I did not have his cooperation and his belief. He was fantastic and a classy guy. I had great players on that team. Every time I see them -- I see Sam. I'm looking for the day that Sam Cassell is a head coach, and I want to see him cussing at players the way I cussed at him. The other thing I want to say is I made a lot of good moves. I made some crazy moves. I traded Robert Horry twice. But I really believe he belongs in the Naismith Hall of Fame. He's proven it time and time again. He's made so many teams champions playing a role, and that's so important. It isn't about just the stats. It's about getting results. I pray that one day he's going to be able to stand up there and accept that honor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",I want to thank the owners that had confidence in me to run their teams,"Charlie Thomas, Les Alexander and Jerry Buss. But especially the players. Then of course my assistant coaches. I still talk to my assistant coaches. We're like brothers. We still talk basketball. Having Carroll with me, just think about being in a high-pressure job with your older brother sitting right next to you. So that brought me a lot of comfort. I'm just blessed to be here. Thank you, guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"If I could, I just want to mention something that happened earlier today. Rudy had a thing to go speak to NBA Entertainment. We went over to the JW Marriott and went down to this huge room, and it was really interesting to me. You see the NBA Entertainment people here and there and around the building, but there was a group of over a hundred people that were together. There were whiteboards with all kind of stuff written: Stay on this guy, this could happen. It was like an unbelievable thing. Rudy spoke to these people today, and it gave, really, a unique perspective. He was fantastic. I also want to mention Rudy's girlfriend, Lisa Marcussen, is here as well. So thank you for being here. I know we have some questions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"The truth behind it is it came from Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns, who said, ""The Rockets have the heart of a champion. That's why they beat us."" They had us down a couple years, and we fought back and won that series. Now, Charles (Barkley) had another quote. He said, ""They're like those damned Texas roaches; you step on them and you think they are dead, and they scurry away."" I thought I would pick his better than, you know (laughter)."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,Jim Boylen.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Yeah, we all started in the film room. I was in the film room for Bill Fitch. In fact, I have to give Bill Fitch so much credit. He worked my butt. I'm telling you, if I had a smile on my face, ""You need some more to do."" I did the video. I broke down the video. I did the scouting report. I did the walk-through and the college scouting. That's five people's jobs right there. But it prepared me to be a solid coach. I need stuff like that. When I don't have stuff to do, my mind wanders. I get in trouble when I start thinking too much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"Rudy and I both worked for Coach Fitch. Coach Fitch told me the story that he used to have Rudy, when Rudy first started as an assistant coach, in the visiting arenas, he would go to the top of the arena with a camera. Bill called it the wide angle. Bill always wanted to have the wide angle in case there was some kind of incident that happened that the TV cameras wouldn't quite get. If you can envision a guy who is a future Hall of Famer as a coach, and probably should be as a player as well, up at the top of ARCO Arena in Sacramento, with a small video cam, filming the game as it's going on, and Carroll Dawson was the only guy on the bench at the time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,That's right.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RICK CARLISLE,"Talk about paying your dues, pretty amazing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I remember as we pulled into Hobby Airport, which is a small airport in Houston, the fans were there at 3:00 in the morning. That inspiration was unbelievable. But I stopped at the front of the plane and I said, ""Guys, if I told you all we had to do was win two home games and we would be world champions, wouldn't you think that's a heck of a good deal?"" Then we played a hell of a team. Maybe the worst team for us to match up with, with New York, because they had all the big guys, and this was an era where there was a lot of rustling and bumping. Good defense was bump the guy at halfcourt, bump him at the top of the key. So we had to come up with a strategy because at that time, we were sort of what I call a one primary scorer in Hakeem, and I relied on him so much."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"I like being an assistant coach. I love helping people. I love the game. I cannot tell you what basketball did for me. I mean, I was from a very poor family. My parents were not educated. My father went to the second grade. My mother went to the sixth grade. They were so shy. I didn't even know how to sit at a table and have a meal because we only had one table and we only had two chairs. So I was so behind as far as being socially compatible with the world. But basketball, I started playing that game, and luckily for me, in my hometown, which is in the middle of Detroit, at our junior high, all the great players in that area would come and play there because we had an L-shaped recessed pole because you get killed playing in Detroit with a straight pole, and I got to play basketball there. If you guys got time, I'll tell you a little bit about my other sport. I played baseball as a kid. Was an All-Star. Played against the greatest Little League player of all time. Art ""Pinky"" Deras, Hamtramck, Michigan, in 1959, went to Williamsport and won. So that's what we did. I had an uncle, my cousin who played second base, he said, ""You've got to have a game plan. You ain't going to college unless you get a scholarship. Your family doesn't have it."" So we had a plan. Baseball was going to be it. I didn't love baseball, even though I was good at it. For some reason, I loved basketball. But in junior high, I never played one second. I got in against the teachers. I had the French teacher isolated. I shook him. I shot it. Air ball. (Laughter) That was my junior high career. So when I told my uncle I was quitting baseball, he says, ""What about our plan?"" I said, ""I'm going to do basketball."" He says, ""Rudy, you're an All-Star in baseball. You sit on the bench."" I said, ""I'm going to go out for the team."" So I go out for the freshman team, and a day before the cut, one of my buddies said, ""Hey, man. I'm in the coach’s home room. I saw the list. You ain't on the list."" I said, ""Are you on the list?"" He said, ""Yes."" I went, ""I'm better than you."" Now, the coach was an ex-University of Michigan linebacker who knew nothing about basketball. He just took the job to make some extra bucks. So me being a shy kid, I would never approach somebody, but I wanted to play basketball so I challenged the guy, before he could announce the cut, to a one-on-one game. He thought every dribble was a fumble. So he would dive on the ball, knock me down. I jump over, I put it in and I won the game. He gave me a jersey and I got to play. That was the worst freshman team in the history of our school. But I had the bug. At that playground, at that junior high, Detroit Pistons came there. Mel Daniels, college All-American, I played against him there. That's where I learned the game. I was so lucky. But like I said, social skills, when I think about I'm a coach and I've gone up and I get so locked up trying to give a speech. In fact, I think I was telling Rick, when I was in junior high, this teacher said, ""Man, you need to get out of your shell. You need to run for class president."" I said, ""Oh, no, that's not me."" I didn't know how to do a speech and all that. I go up to the microphone, I'm so nervous. I grab my fingers and crack my knuckles into the mic and everyone starts laughing. It was the most embarrassing thing. I had a sadistic friend that wouldn't let them stop. He brought it (the sound volume) up and the roars kept going. I said, ""I'm never going to speak to anybody again."" To think that I'm up here doing this stuff. The long road it took, that journey. But basketball was the vehicle, man. Basketball does so much. All sports do it. I just feel lucky as hell."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Pinky, we had nicknames in our city. It was a Polish city. So we had a girl who went to Wimbledon at a very young age. Her name was Peaches Bartkowicz. What was so wonderful, I'm so blessed that at our little park -- Hamtramck has one square mile, and we had a park there. We had a Hall of Fame tennis coach who taught at the courts there and then the Little League stuff and that was all volunteer coaches. So Pinky, he was in the Cardinal farm system. He went up there and came back and became a policeman in the suburbs. He passed away maybe five years ago. Such a humble guy. His kids never knew what a great baseball player he was. And then Samuel, there was something about Sam. Back then, I was a head coach, but I still thought like a scout. So I did the tapes and I did Sam first. He was like the fourth-rated point guard that year from the scouting services. I watched Sam first. I said, ""I like this guy, he's pretty damn good."" And I looked at the guys ahead of him and I said, ""No, no, no, I'm going back to Sam."" I wound up watching every game of Sam's. Then we brought him in for an interview and we just clicked. He was a basketball player. He was like the guys on that court that I played. He wasn't thinking about golf then or doing this and all that; I'm a player. When he goes in the gym, he's one of the alpha guys. He's going to be in there. We kept calling him, ""Where have you visited, where have you gone?"" Nobody even brought the guy in to interview him. I couldn't believe it. I think Robert might have been -- I can't remember which one was first, but those are my babies, and I want the best for them. I was lucky the Rockets gave me the ability to make the picks. A lot of times, you have a different department doing it and it doesn't jive. It was a perfect storm. We were a family. We worked so well together. And then bringing Clyde (Drexler) back in to join Hakeem, maybe the only star that we could have made that trade for in the middle of the season because they had that relationship. I would have said, ""No, I'm going to give loyalty to these guys. I'm going to let them defend their championship."" But we were so bad. We had gotten happy feet. We were losing to teams that we shouldn't, and it became available. We said, ""Let's pull the trigger."" And Clyde was phenomenal."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",RUDY TOMJANOVICH,"Well, you know, it's funny. I looked at the assets. I looked at the positive of players and I would get excited. It's like chemistry. What he can do; what this guy can do and all that and how you put that together. I loved diagramming something that not everybody is doing and put -- maybe that guy is better going left; we'll shift the floor. First of all, treating people with respect, until they prove they don't deserve it. And I did. I just loved -- when I saw a player, it looked like all the things he could do was such an asset. I think that that's why they felt -- they would say a player's coach. I don't know what a player's coach is. There is a separation. You have different roles and all that. As a young guy, I'm sure Joe (Mazzulla) has had to go through all that stuff, learning how to do things. Sometimes you've got to be tough. In fact, the year that we did decide to do the trade, I had what I called two helicopter halftimes. That's when you take your coat off and you swing it around your head and you throw it and get upset. But it doesn't happen often. So I hope that answered it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think that we responded really well. You know, the way their defense is set up and how much they're loading up and converging at the rim, it just puts us in positions to attack and find the easy kickout reads and just to keep the ball popping and things like that so we can get good to great shots on each and every possession."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, every time I'd take a couple dribbles, there was, like, three people were right there. So we got a bunch of shooters on our team and guys that can space the floor. They kept leaving Jrue open. So it wasn't like I had to do anything spectacular. It was just about finding the open guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Good thing we don't have to find out. We're very, very fortunate to have him and he was excellent tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah. And you guys are smart enough to know the way our team is set up. Like, we have so many talented guys on both ends of the floor, that it could be a number of guys on a given night. We have a really talented team, and that's how we win games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, the way they started the game, right? They were playing faster. You could tell that they wanted to shoot more threes. Neither team really shot the ball well from the three, but you could tell that that was part of their plan, just to play faster and shoot more threes and crash the glass a lot more as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, there's different ways, I guess, to phrase that. It's not all about scoring. I can be the guy rebounding and getting assists and drawing attention, right? I'm going to have the ball in certain spots, right? I draw so much attention. It's not always -- I'm not always going to be the guy to get the shot, but sometimes sacrificing, being in those spots to make the play that we get the best shot possible, knowing that what they want to take away in their schemes and things like that. So being the guy in different ways. Maybe you don't score all the points, but you do all the things that put your guys in the best position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It has a lot to do with that I've been here before and we didn't win, and it's just like, you know, we're so close to what we're trying to accomplish, why would I let my ego or my need to score all the points gets in the way of that. There are going to be times where I need to score, and obviously, I need to shoot better. Golly. But you know, really, we always talk about do whatever it takes for however long it takes. If I need to have 16 potential assists every single night and that's what puts us in the best position to win and it doesn't mean I'm the leading scorer, by all means, if that gives us the best chance to win, sign me up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That was a big-time play for those guys to get back. I fell on the ground, so as soon as I just turned my head and looked up, I seen that they made a play at the rim. That was big, guys making winning plays at crucial times on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think, from a team aspect, it's just a natural process. There's a lot that goes into joining a new team, from a personal standpoint and then, you know, you've been so used to a different organization, now you come to a new team and having to learn personalities and play style and things like that. I've had a relationship with Jrue from a few years ago, we won a gold medal. So I would just, I guess, check in or always remind him, I guess, that, you know, to be yourself and, we're going to need you in big moments, obviously like tonight. Not that maybe he didn't need the reminder, but just letting him know throughout the season how much we value him and things like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Awesome, awesome, awesome. Very important obviously. To go to Dallas now 2-0. It’s going to be some tough games on the road, but it’s good we took care of business tonight and go to Dallas up 2-0."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I feel good. Feeling good. Yeah, I don’t think it’s anything serious. But we will look at it tomorrow and go from there, but all good. I’ll be good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Today I felt better. A little better conditioning. Like I said before, even though I had a really good comeback game, it’s tough to jump into the rhythm like that and have the conditioning and have the rhythm and have all of those things. But I think I did a decent job tonight again and helped the team win and that’s it. We move forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not difficult at all. I’ll die out there if we need. So just kept going. Was a little bit limited, so the smart thing was to get Al back in there and close out the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I think I have to give a shout-out to our best defensive guys like Jrue Holiday, D-White. JB has been tremendous on both ends of the floor. All three of those guys played incredible today. We just have so many weapons that it’s tough. But defensively, I’d say, those guys and Al take us to a different level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, first it starts with our transition defense. If we don't get back and make it five-on-five, it's hard to be able to do that great. And then the ball pressure, and then just the individual pride, taking on the pride of guarding you and then the guys off the ball, being able to do both, shift and get after shooters. Team defense, the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I feel like we got a group of guys that really want to win. Been around a long time, and they want to do it together. When you have a locker room that has ownership and takes it upon themselves to hold each other accountable, you've got a chance. The guys want to win and make that decision, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to win. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, we still do have blind spots. We're always going to have blind spots. I think it's just recognizing those and understanding how we can leverage them by using the guy next to us to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, before that, I think the play of the game can't go unnoticed, the humility of our team, is Payton's shot at the end of the quarter. You see guys around the league pass up on that shot or fake like they want to take it, so that their numbers don't get messed up. He takes pride in taking that, and that's winning basketball. So that's the first and foremost. That should have been the first question, is the ability of everybody on our team to do different things that lead to winning. I'm really tired of hearing about one guy or this guy or that guy and everybody trying to make it out to be anything other than Celtic basketball. Everybody that stepped on that court today made winning plays on both ends of the floor, is the most important thing. To answer your question, Jayson makes greatness look easy. He does it in a lot of different ways. He does it on defense, he does it on rebounding, he does it on passing, he does it on screening. He's a tremendous player and not hard to coach him. When he has the ability to affect the game in different ways, we're a different team. But it takes everybody to do it. That should answer everyone's question."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The emphasis and where he's grown over the last two years is to take what the defenses give him and learn to impact the game in many different ways. Because of the type of team that we've had, especially this year, he's seen a bunch of different coverages and he's seen different matchups because teams have to match up with him. So coming into a game, it's kind of similar to a puzzle and he's done a great job learning how to solve the puzzle and do different things. Tonight, with the way that they were rotating and the way that they were defending, the most important thing was making the right play at the rim. We were able to stay out of transition because our guys made that. So I thought he did a tremendous job doing what the game called for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, you got to take a look at -- we gave up a 26-point first quarter and then three 25-point quarters. In the 26-point first quarter, we messed up the two for one and fouled a three-point shooter for three free throws. Luka gets two shooting free throws, we give up a transition basket to P.J. Washington, P.J. Washington hits an above-the-break three. That's almost 70 percent of the points there. So, like, the game was going the way we wanted it to go outside of the things that we can control. I thought our guys took the poise and remained in the mindset and the toughness to understand that. And then Jrue, it's connected and that's what people don't realize, is like every guy on our team can't be at their best if this guy doesn't do that. So Jayson's facilitating, Jaylen's decision-making. That leads to Jrue's playmaking, and the way that they're defending us, we have to make multiple plays. We have to have multiple drives. I think Jrue did a great job -- guys did a great job finding him, he did a great job attacking closeouts and then either kicking it back out for a second drive or getting an open shot. And then what he can do defensively. It just goes back to everybody on the team works to impact the game differently every single night."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,That was sick.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it just comes back to he's not defined by one thing. He's just a little bit of everything. He can handle a pick-and-roll, he can score in pick-and-roll, he can stay spaced. He's not defined by scoring. He rebounds, he plays defense, he can play pick-and-roll, ball handling, the pick-and-roll screener. He's had blocks on bigs. So he's just another guy that's selfless and wants to impact the game in any way that he can, and it looks different every night. I think the thing about him is the confidence that he has to maybe go some possessions or a half or -- because teams are guarding us differently, his frequency can be impacted because of that at times. But he just fights to impact the game in different ways."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, the most important thing is getting a good shot and not turning it over. So in the first half, even though miss and our points per shot was much higher than theirs, I liked every shot that we took. That's the most important thing, is take what the defense gives you, whether it's a layup or three. The second piece to that was our offensive rebounding. So I think we had an offensive rebounding rate in the first half of, like, 41 percent, and it died down in the second half. But when you're not shooting it well, you still want to make the right plays so that it doesn't impact the other end of the floor. But you have to have the offensive rebounding capacity to get extra possessions, and I thought we did a really good job of that in the first half and hit some timely ones in the second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No, he's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"He has the humility and selflessness to not care if he misses it. He practices it and has an understanding of how a shot like that can impact the end of a quarter and it can impact the run that a team makes. So they had went on a run to end the quarter, and I thought that shot kind of gave us a little bit of poise and a little bit of momentum that we needed heading into the fourth quarter. That was big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah. Yeah. He takes pride in that, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, because you have to look at the other side of the coin. If you get away from the discipline and doing what you do in those situations, it's going lead to other things, and it goes to the trust that the guys have in each other. So as long as you're taking great shots, you have to trust the process. On the back end of that, you got to have your offensive rebounding rate to help you. When things aren't going that way, you have to keep them off the free-throw line, which we didn't do a great job of, but we had three 25-point quarters. So usually what happens is you have those empty possessions on the offensive end, your defense starts to weigh in or you start to mistrust the discipline of your spacing and your shot selection, and you end you giving transition and getting cross-matched. So the guys trusted and stayed discipline and we were able to stay out of cross-matches and we were able to kind of keep the game in the way we wanted to play it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,My interpretation? It looked like a foul. But it wasn't called. So it wasn't a foul.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, just trying to keep -- Boston is a team that can run off threes in a hurry. Just trying to keep that from happening. Also, looking at just trying to give my guys some rest because they were fighting extremely hard. We are playing uphill, and so the lead went from 6 to 12, but then we responded after that second timeout."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Big. The small things, you know, we have to do the small things, and that's part of the game. Those are points that we left on the board, and we didn't shoot free throws well tonight, and we have to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,He had great looks. They just didn't go down. That's just the game of basketball. Sometimes you make them. Sometimes you don't. You continue to keep playing. He had some good looks that just didn't go down for him tonight.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, he was great. No matter what he says, that's just who he is. He's a leader. It's not all on him. It's a team. We win as a team, and we lose as a team. So he put us in a position. He was really good tonight. Unfortunately, we just couldn't get over the hump. I thought our defense was really, really good. We've just got to take care of the ball. There's too many turnovers that gave them points, and then also being able to -- we've got to score the ball, and right now, we've got to find someone to join Luka and Ky in that scoring category."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think Luka is a special player. He's one of, if not the best player in the world, and he causes a problem. He's able to find guys. Again, creating open opportunities, and we just didn't take advantage of it. And we'll go back and look and see if we can get even better looks. But the looks that we got, we just missed some open threes. It was good to see Exum knock down an open three, and hopefully we can build on that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we do have quite a few young players. And for them to have fun and enjoy this, and learn from it, and that's what they are doing. And we've counted on them all year, not just here in the Finals, but throughout the season and also in the Western Conference Finals or the playoffs with Oklahoma City or the Clippers. And for them, it's just a matter of getting comfortable and going back home. Hopefully that will help."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We've just got to stay positive. Some of us have been in this situation before, and so just take one possession at a time, and we've got to focus on Game 3, and that's all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they haven't lost a game since May something, right? Yeah, they're hot. And not just on the road, but at home. We've got to protect home, and that's it. We've got to find a way, continue, again, to build on our defense. Our defense put us in a position to win tonight. Unfortunately, our offense didn't help us. And so, again, Ky and Luka are going to get their looks. We have got to get someone else involved of being able to knock down some shots. Defensively, we can build on this and we can be better. We've got to take care of the ball. If we can take care of the ball, hopefully that gives us more opportunities at scoring."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, well, I think it's a matter of not just playing one-on-one but setting -- setting it up so that they can get a live ball catch and be able to work. With Luka there for a minute, he was playing below the defense, and we were able to get him on the box or at the nail, and he took full advantage of that. Just being able to move the pieces around. And I thought we did that. We've got to take care of the ball. I've said this; I sound like I'm repeating myself. But if we can take care of the ball and not give them live-ball turnovers where they are not just laying up the ball or dunking, it puts us in a better seat. We've got to take care of the ball. That's the next step in the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we are not down. We're positive. This is a group that believes. We didn't get an opportunity to get a split or win two here on the road. Now Boston held serve. Now we've got to go home and hold serve."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Luka's questionable. So, we'll see how he feels when he warms up and make that decision."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,I think taking a charge or diving on the floor for a loose ball.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yes, just one game plan. If he's out, we're prepared to go without him, next man up. If he's going, the game plan doesn't change. He's in. We've been in this seat pretty much the whole playoffs. So nothing changes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought yesterday was a great day for us on the floor, and then also watching the game. And then I think for our group, who has been around, we tend to be loose, and I thought yesterday was a perfect example of us getting better and understanding what we have to do tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you look at Ky, he's a vet. He's been on this stage multiple times. But he's played the game where he wasn't effective offensively, or up to his standards, and he will take a look at what he can do better. Again, understands what he has to do tonight. Hopefully we get those same shots. We truly believe that he'll knock them down, and hopefully that puts us in a position to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, Maxi is doing great. He feels great. Hopefully we can find some more minutes for him tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, I think as a player, I mean, it's different. But as a coach, there's a lot of waiting when it's spread out. So you've got to be able to pace the information that you're giving to guys. Don't want to overload them too early. You have to understand that with the break in between, the off-days or the days that you're not going on the court, but they are getting stimulated to still understand they have a job to do; that's as a coach. As a player, you're just trying to figure out how to put yourself in a better position; if you did lose, if you did win, you're anticipating the adjustments, what the team is going to do to try to slow you down. So two totally different things. Again, one is -- also involves the physical activity. The other one has you standing or sitting. So definitely different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, we beat ourselves a little bit tonight just on our turnovers and just some of our defensive rotations. They got a lot of opportunities, second-chance opportunities, where they got an opportunity to go into the fast break and just create just mismatches in transition. Look at some of the positives for sure where we won the first and fourth. But at the end of the day, we've got to win all four quarters if we want a great chance against this team. And we have to make sure that we create enough separation where we can play comfortably, too, and freely. So we had a good pulse about the game, I believe, going up until halftime. And then afterwards, you know, they did what other great teams do, you know, where they put their foot on the gas pedal, started pushing a little bit more, penetrating down the lane a little bit more and creating some opportunities at the free throw line. And they converted tonight, 19-for-20. So you've got to give them credit. They definitely picked up their defensive pressure, but finally we got some great looks as well. It's definitely a great test for us. They did what they had to do. They won both games at home, and now it's our job to go home and win both games at home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"You want to take advantage of playing in front of your home crowd, feeling confident and being able to play in a familiar place. And like I said, they handled what they were supposed to do, first two games, and now it's our job to go home and handle our business. But you've got to give them credit. They kept competing. We kept competing. We've just got to stay together in some of the tough times throughout the game where it could be a four-point lead on them or four-point lead that we have. We just have to keep competing, and I think we'll be in a better place. But feel good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, that's the confidence that I have in myself. A lot of shots were hitting the back rim. That could piss you off as a competitor, but it's all part of the game of basketball. And you have to accept the ups and downs of this. That's, I would say, the toughest challenge when you're in a series. You want to play extremely well, especially when you're playing in a Finals. A little disappointed in myself not being able to convert a lot more on my opportunities that I have in the lane. Obviously, I'm going against Jrue Holiday and Jaylen Brown a few times, but I feel like I have the upper edge on certain possessions where I've just got to convert. They are pushing me to my left end a little bit more. I have to be aware of some of their adjustments like I was in Game 1. Felt good in the first half, but second half the shots weren't going down. Defensively I was out of position and got some ticky-tack fouls and took away from our flow of the game as well. It wasn't all on me, but I'm definitely taking the majority of it because my teammates look to me to convert a lot of these shots and ease the burden of not just Luka but everyone else and settle our team. We definitely made our dinner on the defensive end, but now offensively I have to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"We talked about this last series, he did something similar. But when you're in the Finals and you're taking the brunt of the accountability, he definitely -- he's in the right for wanting to single himself out. But this is a team game. He's not alone, and we are going to tell him that. As expected, he's fresh off the court. He's spilling into his emotions, feels like he could play better, just like me. I would take the brunt of the responsibility. The first two games weren't the best for me, especially him scoring 25-plus the points, getting rebounds, getting assists, doing the intangibles, and for me I've always felt responsible for getting other guys comfortable out there, too. It's on all of us. I'm pretty sure if you hear what everybody has to say, they will say that they can do something better. But I think the message right now is just get our bearings together. We lost by seven points. We don't want to take the total number back home and say we are proud of that. We don't want to do that. We want to go home and be prepared to win games, and in order to do that, we have to be ready to defend this good Boston Celtics team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's just adjusting to the pace. They are playing a great style of basketball, a great brand of basketball where they are pushing in transition. Sometimes those opportunities don't come as often or as easy. They have guys backloaded. They have a lot of guys that are athletic and running back in transition. You saw when P.J. had an opportunity to cut it to five, you saw Derrick White contest him at the rim. You saw Derrick White over there again contesting against D-Lively, even though he got dunked on, he still came over there and contested. That's what they have been doing. They have a lot of pride on that end. And they are not going to be easy on us. So on the fastbreak component, we definitely can create more opportunities for ourselves when we are in Dallas and look forward to doing that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I just chalk that up to just being in Boston. You know, some of those shots, they go up in the air, and I remember last game Sam Hauser caught it in the corner, and I don't think he even brought the ball down. It was practically all net. They feel very confident here. They have been a great team all year. Look at their record, I don't know how many total games they have lost since the postseason started. But I don't think it's more than six or seven. So they have really made their identity here. They want to take care of home court. And now it's our job to go home and do the same. Being in the Finals before, down 0-2, I have a little experience in this. Didn't play particularly well in the first two games in that series, too, that I'm referring to [in 2016]. So now I'm just really leaning in on what I've experienced, what I've learned and some of the lessons I've been able to make sense of in how to come back in this series because it is going to be a possession-by-possession thing, and it is going to be the hardest thing that we've ever done. So I think we've got a great feel, a great experience here in Boston of what the Finals is like for our group. Now we go home and shake off the cobwebs a bit and prepare for another fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Very, very proud of our group. We understood that we had to protect home court. We knew they were going to come out and be more aggressive. We were able to withstand their runs and protect home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I feel like we are just very connected as a group. We’re just out there trying to play hard and compete and make plays. It’s just unbelievable, the will of these guys in this locker room."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, he was unbelievable. His effort defensively and everything he brings on that end. And then on offense, making reads, making the game easy, making the right decisions. He’s so poised and you can tell that he has been in these types of moments. Just very composed and just out there getting the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I thought Jayson was unbelievable. Just navigating everything, getting everybody involved, taking shots when he needed to, defensively being solid, rebounding the ball well. JT just doing it all. We’re asking a lot from him and he continues to step up and answer the call for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"If I could say something before we jump in. I want to address the comment that was made yesterday. I feel like people kind of took that out of context. I've been hearing that I prefer JB over JT and that's not what that was. I like to praise my teammates. I like to praise my teammates when they're playing well, and I feel like that's what I did my best to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Again, I don't think I'm shredding the defense. I think it's moreso JT and JB. Especially tonight, JT was getting into the paint and being double-teamed and making the right plays out of it and just finding me. Just either being at the dunker (spot) or being in the corner. He has that vision as a playmaker, so I would give that to them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Well, first, I fouled Kyrie and put him on the free-throw line and I got my third foul, so Payton came in for me. I didn't want to foul him, but I'm kind of glad that I did. The energy that Payton brings, him just having the balls to take that shot. He's done it so many times this year. Where he's had the courage to take it and he's knocked it has been huge for us. So it was definitely a confidence boost and really just boosted us for the rest of that game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think when you sacrifice together and you do something together, it brings you closer. I think being able to go through wins and losses and to build something, it means a lot. So when you go through things like that, I think it makes you closer and I think that that's what this team has done. From 1 to 15, somebody's sacrificed something. It's been great and the journey's been awesome, but at the end of the day, the job is not done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think just trying to get into space and trying to be in his vision. I know that sometimes when I drive and I might get stuck, I need somebody to drift with me or to kind of be in space and be in my vision. So I think for the most part, I just try to stay in front of him, give him a good outlet. He's been making great reads."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, when I first got traded here, he was obviously one of the first people that I talked to, and I just think his positive nature. He's kind of this kind soul, somebody who has great energy about him. So every time that I talk to him and every time I see him, he's always been encouraging. This has been from the beginning. It's always nice to have somebody like that have your back and, again, somebody like that in your corner in your organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I'm a utility guy. I'll do whatever. I'm here to win. I feel like they brought me here to win, and I'll do my best to do that. But at the end of the day, this is their team. I know it's probably just as much my team as theirs, but again, I feel like I talked about this before, the pressure that they have on themselves to execute and to be great is a little bit different than my pressure. And, again, I've always been honest about that and how they always handle themselves has been something that's been so honorable. So it's just, it's slightly different. They're superstars and I'm here to support."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, well, that one we were actually down 2-0, that was slightly different, but --"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"And that's, and that's all I remember, too. So I think it's a little different that -- again, a different team, different setting, different year, definitely having COVID year, it was a bit weird. I think being on this team, the journey to this point has been, great, but we still know being up 2-0 means nothing. Job's not done. We have to do whatever it takes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I would say maybe I'm a bit more comfortable. Just knowing kind of the pressure and the atmosphere and obviously what's on the line, this is a bit different."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, in huddles like that, it's intimate, and it's something that we kind of hold close and dear to ourselves. I think in times like that, encouraging each other, being able to police ourselves in times like that when we might be doing something that is uncharacteristic. Or even if we're doing something great, all those things are brought up in those moments to where we can really just go out there and do our best to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Man, I love my teammates. They have been here before. They have been here before and they know what it takes to get to this point. They have shown it. You've seen them in the Eastern Conference Finals and you've seen them in the Finals before. We're all determined as a team. We all want this and it's something that, it's collective. I won't say that I do much or I talk much. I feel like I'm more of an action type of guy. I go out there and I play as hard as I can and do whatever the team needs for us to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think it's natural. I think that they had chemistry and some things I had to figure out. But that just goes to show how great of teammates I have. There's been times where I've struggled kind of figuring out my place or what I need to do to help the team win, and Derrick has been the person who has talked me through it. I've been point guards on other teams and I've been shooting guards on other teams. But Derrick is our point guard, and he's shown that the whole season. I would say that there are different times in the season where each guy's kind of come and talked to me about how they felt and how they saw the game and what I could do to help and all that. That's helped me out tremendously getting to this point."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Stay consistent on defense. Our communication is always tested when it comes to games like this because of how much they want to play on the perimeter. We have to make sure we get those guys inside the line and make sure our rotations are top-tier.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just got to play to the physicality. At the end of the day, you know, they are pushing us around. We've got to be able to do the same thing. That's kind of like what the message was when we came out the second half: Set the tone physically."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Having poise offensively and making sure we get the right guys downhill. Well, pretty much any guy downhill to be honest with you. We've got a lot of guys that can drive to the basket and score the ball that gravitate a lot of attention from anybody that's the low man. So we just have to make sure as bigs, me and D-Lively, make sure we get the guys downhill to where they can get a shot off, or we get a rebound if they miss it, or just throw the lob over the top."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure we are focusing on the positive things at the end of the day. I know Luka said it was a lot on him when it came down to it. It's a team; it's a team game. You know we can't have one person taking the blame for everything because you know we all have faults in certain areas on the floor and we make up for that trying to just really continuing to play through this as adversity, any obstacle that we face, we always have to play through that as a team. So he missed free throws; I missed free throws. There's a lot of guys that missed free throws tonight, and that hurt us. So it's not just on him. Not on Kyrie. It's a team thing, and we just have to come out with the same mindset that we had tonight and try to win all four quarters."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, this is the biggest stage in the NBA. Everybody wants to be here at the end of the season. So we just have to come prepared, shake off the nerves, get the butterflies out. It's going to be crazy atmosphere, crazy energy. It's the NBA Finals. Everybody wants to be in this situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,For sure. They got their crowd into it when we came here and they did their job when it came to protecting home court and we have to do the same thing.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just focus on the positives. At the end of the day, we just find ways to just make adjustments to what we kind of lacked in certain areas, most definitely. Watch film, learn from it and be ready for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"No, I don't think so. I feel like they just made plays at the end of the day."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Our poise. Be comfortable in the situation. Embrace the atmosphere and really embrace whatever's going to be thrown at us. This is a great team that we are playing against, and they are going to throw everything they can at us to just rattle us in any given circumstance. So we just have to take our time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, I actually was -- you know, I always want to play. So all day we did a lot of things to get ready for the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Good. Good. I was okay.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I'm sorry, I don't know who is the Celtics owner."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,No.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Every game we lose, it's a missed opportunity for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, obviously didn't work because we lost. But at the end of the day, we've got to make some more shots. I think my turnovers and my missed free throws cost us the game. So I've got to do way better in those two categories. But at the end of the day, we've got to make shots to win the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"That's why they are the No. 1 team in the NBA with the No. 1 record. They have a lot of great players. Basically anybody can get off. Honestly, I think we didn't do a bad job defending today. We took away threes. We contested more threes. And like I say, I had too many turnovers, and we missed a lot of free throws. So I think that cost us the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, they are physical, yeah. But they try to guard one-on-one. I think today they tried to help more. I was able to get some teammates open. But they are physical. They are very physical. We let them be physical. So they are pretty, pretty amazing on defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,I think it was a charge. We don't really know because I didn't feel it until the next day. I was really surprised. So we think it was a charge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,We've got to make shots. We've got to make free throws and less turnovers. Those three things I think are the key for a win -- to win.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Score more points. But at the end of the day, it's basketball, away or home. We've just got to play better basketball to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Sorry, I don't understand you."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yes -- I don't really know how to respond, but yes. I'm sorry."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought it was great. In moments where we gained some momentum, that helped us get over the hump. So tonight we came out, we didn't shoot the ball well. We were a little flat, but I felt like the crowd helped us stay in the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue has been an example of just excellence. Since he's been here, his role has been different from what it was the last few years on Milwaukee, and he's been able to adapt. Not a lot of guys can do that, be versatile, play different roles and different styles and still have an effect on the game. Jrue, he just came in, he wasn't on the ball as much, still guarded at a high level, but became a corner three-point specialist. That's just a testament to his greatness. Tonight they wanted to emphasize loading up, making us make the right reads over and over again, and Jrue had a lot of opportunities tonight and he took advantage. He's just a hell of a player, hell of a person, great teammate. I credit the victory to him tonight. He played well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, we got a lot of weapons on our team, so we just got to trust what we've been doing all season long, trust our game plan. We didn't hit shots tonight. I thought we had a bunch of great looks. If you go back and look in the first half, Sam had a bunch of great looks, D-White had some look that didn't go down. But we didn't panic. We kept guarding, we stayed in the game and we kept trusting it and we made enough tonight to win the game. But we expect to shoot the ball better going forward when we get on the road."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, Derrick is -- he's been, you know, All-Defensive all season long. In that moment right there, we make a tough rim read. Rim reads lead to transition, so we want to manage that a little bit better. But it's the playoffs, you got to just get back and make a play. Derrick White sprints back. I see they have an advantage. I sprint back and was able to make a play there. But those are the type of plays that help you win games. It's just effort, that's what it comes down to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Jrue is a great teammate, nothing short of that. He's brought championship pedigree to our team. So nothing Jrue says we question. Jrue, he comes in and he just is who he is. He's got that demeanor, that killer-like mentality, and we respect it. You know what I mean? He's a great teammate and it's just an honor to play next to him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just effort plays. I think tonight we weren't as crisp defensively. It was a lot of missed communications out there, a lot of stuff that we gave up that we didn't give up in the first game. So I think we got to be better in that regard. But I just think our effort has been the key, just the mentality, picking a guy up full court, stuff like that. It just wears on them over time. But I think we need to be more crisp going into the next two games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Man, that was incredible. I heard he, like, checked himself in the game too. Like, he's been hitting those shots all season long. If anybody has been paying attention to it, he's made I don't know how many of those, at least three or four. So tonight he made it in in biggest of moments. But it's just an example of what we do and have been doing all season long. How you finish quarters is big. We didn't finish that quarter great. We got a lot of open looks, we gave up some. There was some bad fouls. One of them was mine. I fouled Luka on the back cut, and then me and JT got mixed communication on the switch. Luka had a three. We got to finish quarters better. But Payton checks himself in the game and covers us a little bit by hitting the big-time shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. That's the majority of what the battle is, just managing your emotions. How do you handle adversity and your will and your perseverance. Everything isn't going to go according to plan. I wouldn't have hoped that we shot, I don't even know, what, 7-23 from three? We had a few ill-advised turnovers and fouls, but effort makes up the difference. Your mindset, we play -- I think we played harder than them tonight, and I think that's just going to be the key. If we want to win, we just got to be the harder-playing team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the key. Just trying to wear on those guys, be as physical as we possibly can, full team effort. Just keep touching them. That's it. I think that those guys are tremendously gifted offensively. They came out swinging. Luka came out in the first quarter, we knew what he was going to do. We knew he was going to be aggressive. But we just stayed with the game plan. We stayed just consistent and we was able to turn him over a few times that helped us push the lead out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 9, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, that's just being patient. You got a lot of energy, excitedness, nerves, when the game starts, but sometimes you just got to be patient. And I got to the paint pretty much whenever I wanted, and I could be patient when I get there. I had a few turnovers where I had a little bit more time to wait for the defender to make a choice, because those two-on-one reads are there, where you get to the paint, the defender is, the big is coming, you either kick it to the corner or if he drives down to the corner you kick it to the wing. But don't got to be in a rush. Just protect the ball, make the great decisions and trust your teammates. I think that's what the majority of this is. We did that enough tonight, but I think we need to do it a little more going into Dallas."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We expect them to play better. They have showed that all postseason. I think they have lost Game 1 a couple times, and they came back with a big Game 2 win. So we expect them to play a lot better. We've got to be even better than we were last game and just try to clean up the things we made mistakes on and understand it's definitely going to be a bigger challenge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,I feel like always the No. 1 adjustment is to play harder. Play with more physicality. We can't be satisfied. We've got to understand that. We've been talking about that the whole postseason. It's just physicality. So we've got to be ready for whatever they throw at us.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Each game just gets more and more difficult. The more comfortable you get with the team, the more you know what they like to do, what we like to do. Each game just gets more and more difficult. Each game is a different adjustment, and you've just got to figure out what they change and how we can attack that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it feels way different. I think anytime you make it for the first time, this is just like a dream come true. And it's just a lot going on, obviously. So this year, I'm not surprised by it, just comfortable and ready to compete."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think any experience is great to have. Obviously, it was a different series, different time, different team. But all experience is nice. We've learned a lot from that. I think we've grown from it. Whatever it takes to win, and whatever it takes to advance, that's what we've been doing this whole postseason. So whatever it takes. We win, we lose, but we got to be ready to compete at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"First things first, you've got to compete. Just try to make them uncomfortable. Obviously, two great players. They kind of play a little differently, but two great players. Just try to keep them in front and try to have them take tough shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I love Joe. Love playing for him. He's a great basketball mind. The way he thinks is next level. I think this year he's just much more comfortable, and we all feel comfortable with him as our coach. It's been great just learning from him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I give Drew a lot of credit for my development in helping me get to where I'm at. I started working with Drew when I was in eighth grade and every offseason since then, we've worked out together. That's like family. I've said it a million times that, you know, Drew is a big reason in helping me get to where I'm at, and you know, I'm very thankful for everybody that played a part in helping me, you know, reach my goal and continue to strive in this space that I'm in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"That, you know, far from over, it's an extremely long series and not get too excited or get too down about a win or a loss. Don't feel like that the series is over and that we had it won because of the last game. And if you lose a game, right, we talk about it all the time; that it's going to take however long it takes. If that's four, five, six, seven, whatever, we are trying to just take it one game at a time and not skip any steps, whatever we've got to do to win. That's what we have to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It's just about reading the game. Draw so much attention, you know, when I have the ball in my hands, and you know, it's about creating an advantage. We always talk about that, watching film, creating advantage, finding the mismatch that we want, and it might not always end up in the shot for you. Or if you set a screen and get a smaller guy on you, just having that mismatch and calling for the ball, right, it may draw other defenders to help, and we can pin in for somebody else to get a shot. You know, those things won't show up in the stats sheet, but it's part of our execution, and sometimes you have to make a sacrificial cut or things like that to generate good shoots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I mean, it's a lot that goes into that, right. Time of the game. Time to score. Who is in the game with me. All those things play a part. A lot of times, if you can generate shots for other people and make the defense have to respect those guys, it eventually opens a lot of other things up for you later in the game that you can take advantage of."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"No reaction. This is a team sport, right. We understand that. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have JB on our team, and we can say that for a lot of guys, right. We have all played a part in getting to where we're at, and we understand that people try to drive a wedge between us. I guess it's a smart thing to do or try to do. We've been in this position for many of years of guys trying to divide us and say that one of us should be traded or one is better than the other. So it's not our first time at rodeo."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"They really just kind of test your discipline. They test, are you going to make the right play over and over and over again. Even if it's not resulting in you getting the shots or you scoring all the points. But you know, you're constantly scoring at a high rate. We are up 20 at halftime. They are trying to test if human nature is going to play a part of wanting to get yourself going. Instead of doing all the things that is making the game easier for the team, you know, you just have to stay committed to doing what's right and making the right play until they adjust their defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Whoever’s open. (Laughter).
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we understand that. I feel like we're going to get -- I don't want to say their best shot, but you know, we understand that they are going to play a lot better, and we have to be prepared for that. Not let it catch us off guard or, you know, wait till the second quarter if we are down to lock in. Understanding from the jump that they are going to come out and play faster. They are going to shoot more threes. They are going to play harder. So I think knowing that coming into the game is the first step. And then, you know, focusing on what we need to do. There's a lot of things that we watch in film that honestly we feel like we could be a lot better at. All in all, we feel like tomorrow should be really fun."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, we've had conversations about it before. In all reality, we've just had to deal with it for a very long time. I think it's part of us maturing as men, right. Very, very young coming into this league, and just had to deal with all the ups and downs of, essentially, the success that we've had. There's been positive things and there's been negative things that come with that. We are not the first duo to go through that process, and we won't be the last. So understanding that side of it, and just keeping the main thing the main thing, and focusing on the job that we have front of us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think, like I said, just over time, you learn how to deal with things. There was a point, right, in my career where things did affect me or would bother me that, you know, to hear people talk about me on TV. But you just have to come to a realization that, for one, don't take it personal. People have a job to do. You have to respect that. They have to go on TV and give their analysis of, you know, things that they see and watch, and that's fair. You understand what the media side has done for the game of basketball and how we have all benefited from that. Again, people wouldn't talk about me if I wasn't one of the best players. I'm not the only player that they have ever talked about, and I won't be the last. So understanding that side of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I was in my hometown of West Linn. I believe I was in West Linn. Maybe I was in Oregon City. But, yeah, I was back home."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I just remember KG, after he won, doing the interview after where he was shouting out to his kids and stuff like that, going crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"In 2008, I was 10."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"Playing sports, baseball, basketball, running around. Big into sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Not until high school. It's when I transitioned to just hoop.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,Always basketball. I liked it all equally. Baseball and football.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"They said that? I don't know if I'm superstitious. Maybe I'm like superstitious like if I have a bad shooting game, I probably won't wear those shoes again. That's about it. Like something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,This feels similar. We've been through it before. So we're used to a lot of things coming. So we know we've got to be ready for Game 2 and try to take care of business.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's an unbelievable player so you have to be prepared for a lot of things. You have to play hard, make things tough and hope he misses."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He draws so much attention. So even if he's not shooting the ball well, he can draw a lot of attention. Defenses are collapsing on him. Creates easy shots for teammates even when he doesn't have the ball. He's very impactful, always."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"He's really relaxed. Quiet. A little bit reserved. Great dude. Easy to be around. Yeah, he's just easygoing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's hard for me to say because I know him. So I know he's one of the best players. But like the way his personality is, he's just laid back. So he's not, like, showboating and acting like he's the best. He's confident but -- I think he's confident knowing who he is so he doesn't feel the need to do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I feel pretty good. Yeah. Feel good. Not much more to add. Preparing my body for tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Obviously as I said postgame, it was like a relief, being back on the court, healthy, winning games, starting off the series the right way. It was definitely a relief. But yeah, it's like a lot more work to be done and yeah, tomorrow we get another chance on our home floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's huge. It's huge, obviously. But yeah, to be honest, the way I moved, looking back now at the game, and I don’t think I even expected myself to be able to be moving so well. That was, again, a good sign for myself and now having two days in between and preparing my body again, getting even probably better conditioning now for next game will be huge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, good, like, how do you say, description of a little bit, especially preparing myself all regular season for the playoffs and round one, something unfortunate happens and staying mentally put and staying in the right place to have the chance to come back later in the playoffs and of course I wanted to come back earlier but it didn't work out that way. But here I am now and healthy and able to put on a good game for my first game back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It was insane. I'm not going to lie. Just walking in the tunnel was like a WWE style walk-in. I didn't even know it was for me at first walking out, hearing that crowd roar and getting real excitement to start the game and give everything to these fans that came."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,We were joking in the back that I should do that next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think that goes unnoticed a lot of times and what goes unnoticed is he doesn't get the credit a lot of times and he's the first one to get all the blame if he doesn't have a monster game. It's a little bit unfair to him. But hats off to him for taking it on the chin and conducting himself as a champion and being like, I'll do whatever it takes for this team to win. Of course, he's always the focal point for the other team and JB and then maybe, I don't know, I'm third, fourth, fifth, sixth on the list. That takes a lot of pressure off me. I can have a lot more open looks, a lot more, like, good situations for me. That's credit to JB and JT but especially JT."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The balance is having proper spacing. Making the right play. I thought we did a good job of fighting for our spacing, making the right two-on-one reads. That's more important than anything else. And so I think regardless of who we are trying to attack, making sure we are at the proper spacing and making sure we are making the right play based on where the two-on-one read is is the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great person. He's a great coach. Just humility, joy, work ethic, intensity that he brings. And, you know, we've grown to have a great relationship. So I'm very grateful for him, and I'd like to think that we make each other better. So it's great that he was here. It's great that he was able to share some of his wisdom and got to spend time with him."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, when I talked with him in the process of deciding if he wanted to come here, I said the thing about our team is we need everybody and we are going to play guys. You don't get to where we are at right now and win a lot of games unless you have great depth. And throughout the season, because it's such a long season, what those guys do kind of gets lost in the shuffle. But there was moments where he helped win us games, second night, back-to-back, four in five, whatever it is, NeeNee [Neemias Queta] and those guys starting. So their ability to just stay locked in and stay professional and impact winning is very important, and so that was what I told him before he came here, and him, the other guys and the player development staff do a great job of just staying on top of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just need to focus on the truth. At the end of the day, nobody knows because they are not in the locker room. And so I think as long as we focus on the truth, we focus on the things that we talk about every day, we focus on the relationships that we build with each other, we focus on just that stuff. They can look at it however they want. At the end of the day, what goes on in our locker room, how we communicate with each other, how we build relationships with each other and how we treat each other on and off the floor, that's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I wonder how many of those have been Christian coaches.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, spacing is, like, ages old. It's the most important thing. I think you've seen different spacings based on how the game has changed and how the game has evolved and how your roster evolves and how -- I think the better offenses have gotten, the more creative defenses have gotten, and the ability to put guys in certain spots, protecting the rim, where are your best individual defenders. So being valuable in your spacing I think is the most important thing because you have an understanding of who is where, and you have an understanding of where the advantages are. And so it's one of those things that you have to fight for. It's a simple detail that, if you don't talk about a lot, it can get overlooked. But your spacing can manipulate the type of shots that you get and the decisions that you make, and I think that's the fight. Dallas's defense, they are one of the smartest, best defensive teams in the league, and they have the ability to manipulate your spacing with their rotations and with their personnel, and so we've got to be just as creative and just as disciplined in our spacing to make sure that we can counteract that. That's kind of what Pep has helped me with, spacing. Very important in transitions how you move those guys."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think as you get into this, you start to realize, once you're in a position, nobody can really relate to you other than people in those positions. So you develop a bond with other coaches and you know what they are going through and you know what the challenges are and the opportunities and the situation you're in. So I think it's really important that we all stick together, me, him, Coach [Jim] Montgomery, Alex [Cora]. You just have to stick together and help each other through it because each of our four coaches have been through it, whether it's inside Boston or outside Boston. Jerod and I got close as assistants, just how would you do things when it's your opportunity, what have you learned from the head coaches that you've worked for. And now that we are in this position, it's helping each other with the transition and the different experiences."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The most important thing for guys like Sam and Payton is having an understanding we would not be here without those guys. They have literally won games for us. And you're not defined by scoring. That's one of the strengths of this team top to bottom, whether it's the starters, role guys, not one guy strives to be defined by one thing. So getting two stops on defense, being in the right spot, getting two rebounds, getting to the free throw line, sprinting to manipulate the spacing to get an open shot. All those things count for the same, especially at this time of year. And Sam has done a great job in his career of not being defined as a shooter, of being able to do other things. And our team has taken that on, and we have to work to stay to be that well-rounded on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just making sure we make them uncomfortable from the jump. I feel like Game 1 we eased into the game when we shouldn't have. We should have came out and threw the first punch instead of taking the first punch. They are a great-shooting team, and we just have to be able to get them off their spots and force them into our defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY,"Adapt. Learn. As I said before, if we are the same person we were yesterday, then we aren't getting better. Everybody here wants to the right thing and everything we can possibly do to win. That's what everybody on the team needs to do so we can get a championship."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It's playing our game of basketball and not going into the game that they want us to play. Playing our game of pick-and-roll. Getting out in pace, getting in space and making them overhelp so we can get open shots and we can get people open."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like it's definitely big plays, whether it's a dunk or three ball. As long as our team is together, we are cheering, yelling, connected, it definitely makes other teams question what they are going to do or question their schemes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Our footwork. Our placing of knowing where our positioning is on the defensive side, no matter if it's setting them down, us being low, not being late on coverages and calling out coverages early so they can't get easy pick-and-pop threes. It's been a lot of fail and learn, fail and get a little bit better. We are not going to get better at all if we don't learn from our mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"We have to get up into them. We can't let him just post up, get the ball at the top of the key and just lace it down because he is going to shoot over the top. It's going to be trying to make sure that we get him off of his stops. Get him one or two feet away from his normal spots so he's a little more uncomfortable."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"All he says is keep your head down and stick to the grind. There's not a lot of things he can do all the way back in Dallas. All he's telling me to do is the little things, whether that's hitting them on the box-out or being able to talk to my teammates on the back side. Just doing the little things so that everybody is connected on the court so that we are not leaving everybody behind."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"For sure. I feel like everybody in the first half, everybody is thinking, they can shoot, they can shoot. Whenever we can come out and show that we can defend, we can get them off the three-point line, then it's a different game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DERECK LIVELY,I feel like it's not panic. It's more urgency of getting the job done.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think we've just got to overall be on a better page together, offense and defense. We gave up way too many rhythm threes for them. They have a very capable three-shooting team. On the offensive side, just finding our spots better, creating the space for Ky and Luka to operate and make the right plays. Overall, finding our spots, communication and play better together as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,We believe in each other. We just try to play hard. We saw the mistakes. We watched the tape. So we just have to make the right adjustment and come out with the right energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,We have got to make it a little bit harder on him to get the catches on the elbow. Push out a little bit further and then just stay in front of him and make sure we contest a shot the best way possible. We definitely can't let him get into rhythm early.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think we dealt with good crowds in Game 1s before. I feel like OKC and Minnesota were very loud, too. Obviously, this is the Finals and it's the biggest stage. But at the end of the day, we have to focus on our game and play with the right mindset. I wouldn't say it's a big change for us. We just have to, like I said, focus and do a better job on what we're supposed to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Of course. We have been together for so long now. We had some trades at the trade deadline. But it gives you time to just spend more time together, play more together. The deeper you get into the playoffs, the bond is growing. Even yesterday in the meeting, just the way we communicated and figure out solutions for the problems, it's just showing that we can grow every day as a team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think there's a big, big gap between Dirk Nowitzki and me. He's one of the greatest ever, so I would never, ever dare to compare myself to him. I also think the role that he had and the playoff run that they had back then was so outstanding and one of the most underrated runs -- not underrated but crazy underdog runs. For me, it's an honor to be here, to fight with the team for the championship. I don't take it for granted. Just come out here and play my hardest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought we were too much one-on-one. We've got to move bodies. We've got to move the ball. Multiple guys have to touch the ball. We were just too stagnant, and that's not the way we play. We've got to be better tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Unfortunately, we are not playing. I don't know how to answer that question. I'm taller. I would post him up, but he would probably be more physical. He's one of the best coaches in this league. He's gotten his team to the Finals. They play at a high rate. He understands his group. So when you talk about Joe, he's done an incredible job. And it's not easy, especially when you're favored or supposed to be somewhere. It puts a little bit more pressure. But I think he's handled it well. His group plays at a high level. His group plays hard. He's one of the best coaches in the league. For that, we have our work cut out as a coaching staff. We've got to be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"He got great looks. Unfortunately, our two quarterbacks had turnovers that normally don't happen. Give credit to Boston. But we believe that the shots that he got in Game 1 were great looks that just didn't go down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think there's no panic with this group. We didn't play well in Game 1. Give credit to Boston; they did. But it's a series and we don't just look to capitalize on just one game. We've lost Game 1 a lot of times, and we've responded. We believe that we can respond in Game 2. We just try to take it one game at a time. We didn't have a really good first quarter there at the end. Put us down. But the guys kept fighting. We found a way to get it to eight. It was very similar to the way the playoffs started for us with the Clippers. We didn't play well. We cut that 30-point lead down and made a game of it. But we responded in Game 2 on the road. Hopefully we can do the same thing here in Boston."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Jayson, he's one of the best offensive players in this league. Understanding that he puts a lot of pressure behind the three, behind the line, and then also being able to get to the rim. He's not one that just settles. We have to, again, try to keep him from getting to the rim, keeping him off the free throw and then giving him wide-open threes. And so that's not easy. It's easier said than done. Again, we just have to make it tough on him. On the defensive end, he uses his length. He's strong. He's not one to give in. We've got to find other ways to score."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we knew that he was going to play, and he played well. He played well coming off the bench. He's played well starting, or as he showed, coming off the bench. We've got to make it tougher on him. When he starts to get going, he can shoot it from halfcourt with range. We have to be able to take some of those threes away. On the other end, we have to make him work. But we also got to account for -- when you go to the basket, he's going to be there. You have to account that he's got a good chance of blocking the shots. We have to take advantage of his overhelp at times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think we happened to play the same position, some are a little bit better than others. But when you look at the things this we have to do just in this series better, we've got to take care of the ball, we've got to make it easier for Ky and Luka. Being able to put those guys in different spots on the floor so there's a little bit stress-free so they can do what they do at a high level. We just didn't do that in Game 1. But it's really simple conversation when you talk about things that we have to do not just on the offensive end but the defensive end. Ky and Luka take responsibility for that. Our conversations are really simple and to the point. When you talk about the high IQ, you don't have to sit there and paint the picture. You can just get right to it. They understand from my side what I'm asking them to do, and when they respond I understand what their responses are and what they are talking about and what they see. It's worked at an extremely high level for when we do talk in-game or on a day like today of what we are trying to get to. Those guys trust what I see or what I'm telling them, and I trust their response."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think just understanding this group, it's not about screaming or yelling. It's about what we do best, and when we are having fun and smiling is when we are at our best. I just felt there at the end of the first, we just weren't at our best. It was talked about and it's going to happen. It might happen in Game 2. But the response from our group has to be quicker and it has to be better. Not where we're talking about we have to score the ball, but we have to get better on the defensive end, and that's being connected. We felt we lost a little connection there at the end of the first. But when we talked about it at halftime, it was a great response and we did play at a better level in that second half."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we'll make some adjustments. But Boston is going to give the layup to Luka, so he's got to take it. They're not going to give him the lob, and they are not going to give the corner three. So it's two-on-two, and we have to take advantage of that. We missed some layups. We missed some shots in the paint. That happens. But we believe that Ky and Luka will get into the paint and make them in Game 2. But it's no different than what we saw in Minnesota. Just understanding that Boston is a really good defense, and being able to bluff or take away something, we trust that Luka and Ky will pivot and do what's best, and that's take the layup or take the easy two and continue to wear out the paint and layups. But we've got to make those, too. Because on the other end if you don't make them and they come down and they make a couple threes, it puts a lot of pressure on your offense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, Jaylen is their best player. Just looking at what he does defensively, he picked up Luka full court. He got to the free throw line. He did everything, and that's what your best player does. Just understanding he plays both sides, defense and offense, at a high rate. And he's been doing that the whole playoffs. I mean, when talk about the Eastern Conference MVP, and it seems like he has continued to pick up where he left off. So he's playing at a high rate. We've just got to be a little more physical with him. And again, we have to keep him off the free throw line and out of the paint because, again, he was finishing at a high rate or he was getting fouled and getting to the free throw line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's not the first time. It's not the first time we've heard that Dallas fans are panicking. Shout-out to our fans. We appreciate your support all year. Just stay poised, man. Stay focused on the goal. This mission is bigger than us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"By doing your best not to pay attention to it because a lot of people don't know what they are talking about, and specifically if you've never played that position or been on a team at that level where you have to go through it yourself, and I know that we have people that appreciate the game of basketball that speak on it. But at the same time, it's an everyday thing when you're on the team with, you know, other guys that add value to the team. They have skill sets; they work on their game and they want to be appreciated, too. I do my best to nonchalantly push that conversation to the side of 1A, 1B or whose team is it, this, that. I'm just here to play basketball. It's a dream come true to be at this level. I've had to work extremely hard. I've been a winner my whole entire life. I've obviously had some failures and loss but done a lot more winning. Used to it. In order to be on that type of frequency or that goal, you've got to be selfless in your approach. Obviously you're not going to get it right all the time, but as a teammate, you just want to push those other things to the side that don't really matter or get you better as a team. So we just leave it to everybody else to argue whose team it is and who has the most responsibility. It's all our jobs to be prepared. S----y conversation, but it has to happen in sports."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,Just by paying attention to how we prepare and also just adjustments. Sticking to the game plan.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean it was our first time being together as a group in this Finals stage. Experience is the best teacher at times when you don't know what to expect. Going out there, TD Garden, playing against the Boston Celtics, who are having a historic season. We knew they were going to come out with a lot of verve, a lot of energy. And they have been doing it all year. They have been consistent on their end. I think it's pretty easy to say we can focus on our end and pay attention to what we can control. But it's a little bit deeper than that. Just got to calm our nerves, poise our nerves a little bit and just be aware of the environment we are in. It's going to be high intense from who we are going against. It's going to be very physical. Some things are going to be called and some things aren't. I think we got all that experience in Game 1, and we are looking forward to the challenge in Game 2 to play better and being who we have been since post-All-Star Break and just having fun in doing it. This is the highest level of basketball right now. We are the only two teams playing. We are proud of ourselves but we are not satisfied. We've just got to continue to be ourselves."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"He was reiterating the same things I'm saying, probably a little bit more simple. But he's been giving us a lot of peace of mind, especially when we are out there, high-intense environment, like I said. Just got to play better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"By realizing that I've been in this league for 13 years, and I've been playing against the Celtics for quite a few years and I have quite a few playoff series against them, whether wins or losses. So I just try to be aware that this is a new space that I'm in as one of the leaders of the team and with the new group, and giving them that peace of mind, like I said, when things get tough. We are going against a very historic team in the Boston Celtics, but we're a great team too. We have to remember that. And engaging with fans here in Boston is always fun. Like I said last week, it's something I'll turn the page over on, too, but people continue to ask me about it and what I think about it, which is cool, too. But yeah, this is what makes sports fun. This is what makes the stories fun. Getting a chance to go against a giant like this, whether it be just talking about the team or talking about the environment and the fans and how crazy it can get. This is what I imagine it being like, getting to this stage again, earning our way to be here with my teammates and being able to put our best foot forward going against the best of the best. That's everything you dream of. Everything else is extracurricular."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"No. Not really. Again, I've been able to grow over the past few years to put basketball in perspective. This is an incredible experience that I get to live out for quite a few years of my life. I'm going to learn a lot of lessons that I'm going to apply to life after this. I failed miserably while also not knowing how to compartmentalize or accept the emotions that come with failure, and also being on the successful side, didn't know how to handle that either. So the past few years have been about that growth perspective for me and learning how to handle myself in situations and circumstances that are going to be more beneficial for me to learn now than learning it when I'm 38 years old, and I'm looking back at my career, and I don't even know how to celebrate that. I don't expect to be celebrated by everybody. I'm going to, you know, still be aware that a lot of people want to see me fail. But again, I think I pay attention more to the way that I'm celebrated from people that love me unconditionally and I go home and have a peace of mind. You know, thinking about my time in Boston, I could go down a myriad of things that none of you in here know that I was dealing with, and I don't think a lot of people would care. I think a few people would care and want to hear about it, and I would leave that space open in the future if you ever want to hear about it. But putting into perspective the blowup dolls and remarks that are getting said, that's basketball. When I leave out of here and I walk around Boston, I don't hear a lot of the things that I hear when I'm playing on the court. There's a lot of mutual respect. There's a lot of eye-to-eye communication that's built on just being human, and they appreciate the things I do off the floor, as well. So there are a lot of Celtics fans out there that still love me, too, surprising to everybody. But when I'm on the street walking around, which I do, you know, it's a lot of love. I get a lot of embrace. I take pictures. My dad is here, he played at Boston University. So there has to be a respect there because if anything happens to my family while I'm here, then it goes way beyond the game, you know. And I don't forget things either. Somebody threw something at me while I was here. I've heard it all. Nobody asked me how I felt after that and why it could be a little bit of a traumatic response when I'm back in this environment after somebody does something like that. You know, so things have changed since then. I've been able to accept what I cannot change but also change the way that I look at things to be more positive. So this is fun for me, man. This is healthy. I'm glad that I can be up here on this stage speaking authentically and then also go home and be at peace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, teaching is fun. Being a student is even more fun. So when you're in a film session with J-Kidd or Coach [Sean] Sweeney or even Luka, myself, and the rest of our guys, there's a lot of honest communication going on. Just what we see. And we always make sure that we are aware that -- we're a new group in this environment, too. So give ourselves some grace and patience and be ready to play our best game every day and prepare. The things we see out there, we have to talk about it. Some of the cues that you would normally have when you make it to this level, we are still developing, and that's okay. So as we look to become an even better team, a greater team through this experience, this is what's needed is just that honest communication."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I would start off with this. So, try not to get FOMO as best you can just because you're so used to playing every single day, working out every single day towards a goal, and now that that goal isn't necessarily there to win the Championship, you have to set other goals, and that comes from a personal standpoint. You know, what do you want to accomplish bringing into next season, it starts now while no one is watching and while it's just you by yourself or your brother or you're playing five-on-five. Just working on the things that everyone said that you were not great at or you could not do or that you see within yourself that you need to improve. Because you're seeing how hard it is to get here and how long you have to stay locked in, as you said. So I've been able to find some peace of mind throughout this journey, throughout this year, of just making this phrase, like our team bonding thing, like just peaking at the right time. Some teams peak really early, some teams peak in the middle of the season, and some teams start peaking at the end. Some teams get into the playoffs or get deep into the playoffs and they peak. It just depends where you are as a team and your understanding of what you're doing, and also appreciating all the hard work it took to get here. A lot of our peers are watching and trying to get back to where we are, get here. So we have to be aware that the hunger is going to be more next year, but we are also going to be hungry, too, to show why we are one of the best in the world. Two teams left. Dream come true as a kid to be in a Final, see the court change a little bit, see all the stickers, see the 600 media members and credentials we get. It can be a lot, but it's also something you want to appreciate because you never know when you're going to get back. Take your time, but also work your tail off right now because I know I'm going to have to get ready for you guys next season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"They're definitely a team that is going to come out swinging, much, much more aggressive. For us, to be able to come out with the same energy and continue to play at a high level like we've been doing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Every series is different. Every game is different. For us, we understand it's a big challenge. We are not really thinking about the past. We have to focus on this Game 2 and make sure we do the things we need to do to put ourselves in position to win a game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It presents its own challenges. And now obviously I know that they are going to come out very aggressive, and we are, as well. It's just one of those things that we have to make sure that we just stay the course. Emotions are obviously going to be high. From Game 1 to Game 2, the biggest thing is making sure we are as prepared as we can be and ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"DJ has been great for us. Very clear with his concepts what he wants to do. Creating how he wants us to execute things. I feel like our group, obviously we’ve bought in, we’re really locked in and trying to do the best we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",AL HORFORD,"J-Kidd, man, I see what he is doing. I see what he is doing. Jaylen Brown is an unbelievable player and very special for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Yeah, I think we came out aggressive, which was good. Gave us some leeway to withstand their punch when they came back. I think we did a pretty good job executing for most of the game but keeping our poise, even being up almost 30 and then coming down, cutting it to eight. I think we kept our poise pretty well and pushed it back up to 20."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Something different. They are probably going to try to get more threes. I think their role players are going to make more of an impact, and then they are just going to come out more aggressive. It was Game 1. It’s always a feeler game. I think when both teams get more comfortable out here, it will be a battle."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think having that mindset that we want this win and however long it takes, no matter what it takes, get it done. So not every game is going to be pretty, or like the first game. Just knowing that if we do what we're supposed to do, we'll always have a chance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It's Game 2 of the Finals. I think we are definitely expecting them to swing and come out clawing and fighting. We know in their Game 2s, Luka has started off, definitely been killer, especially, in the first quarter. I think at this point we have to lock into the game plan and do the best we can to kind of withstand their punches and go from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we did the best we could trying to take away their lobs. Those are definitely energy plays for them. Two high flyers in Gafford and Lively, we tried to take those away. I think we tried to keep them on the free throw line as best possible, and we know they have corner shooters in Derrick Jones Jr. and P.J. Washington and Tim Hardaway Jr. They have a lot of great role players out there. So just really going to do the best we can to try to minimize it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think the relationship between Jayson and Jaylen is natural. I don't think that they try to force anything upon one another. I feel like people do try to make it like a big deal, but honestly, who they are, they can be quiet at times, but when they speak, everything that they say is important. And I think that their relationship is their relationship and it's been awesome."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I like it a lot better being on their side rather than -- rather than going against them just because I've been in situations where I've had to guard both of them in a series and it's extremely difficult. The way they play, the way they complement each other, especially being aggressive getting into the paint, both being great playmakers in the first game, balancing that with scoring and making everybody better; I'm glad I'm on this side."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, for sure. He's probably our best defender, so hearing that is pretty empowering. Really all you're trying to do is make it as hard as you can on a guy like [Luka]. He's so good. He's going to make some tough shots even if you do play really good defense. You have to know it’s going to happen and just have to have a next-play mentality in terms of that. We were really connected last game, and we have to continue to be that way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Just try to help the team win in any possible way and bring energy. I thought I did a pretty good job of that. You know, just got to continue to do that, and that's probably going to be my role throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I work on it every day in practice. You don't really get an opportunity to shoot them in the game very often. I think I maybe had one or two throughout this season. But that one just happened to be the NBA Finals and people are making a big deal out of it. I don't know, I mean, I put the work in, and sometimes you get to showcase it like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I had a great community growing up that supported me and helped me, you know, get to this point for sure and had influence on my path growing up. It's pretty cool to have those people still reaching out, like schoolteachers, coaches. Obviously, my family and friends always have kept tabs, but it's pretty cool to have those people reaching out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"You've just got to be disciplined. My mom always says, just treat others with respect, and you're bound to receive that from them as well. Just treat everyone the same and put your work in. Don't worry about what other people say."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I would just say he's like got a unique approach to the game. He pulls things from, like, soccer teams, pulls things from killer whales and how they go about finding food and prey, things like that, and he ties it into the game of basketball. And I think it's a unique way to go about it. It's different and cool and engaging."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,I'll let him. I don’t really know how to describe it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I mean, nothing in particular. Just I didn't even do it before the game. It was more of something I could turn to when I need something to switch things up. I feel like if you need extra motivation to play in the NBA Finals, you're probably in the wrong business. I was ready to go and get back out there and just got to continue, like I said before, just bring energy and help this team any way possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,First stretch of the game I tried to come up and tried to be aggressive and try to help my team. Just trying to put pressure and try to make possessions and try to find my teammates when they was open.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"No, he has not shown us film of his old playing days, but he does do a good job of emphasizing us playing with pace and pushing the pace and playing fast."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"I feel like the bond is growing stronger. We are around each other every day and we talk to each other, hang out and play games. I feel like our bond is really close."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,Probably [Alex] Fudge. He's got a good playlist.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"It's always good to learn from Sham. He's a good person. Always come here with joy and his background and history behind this game and with the moves Sham got, he just brought a lot of history to this game. You know, it's just good to have people like him out here helping us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"He's been telling us from the jump before we even got here that coming into this thing it was going to be a fight and staying composed and composure and sticking together. There are times when they go on runs in a game. So sticking together and staying together throughout their runs. And I feel like if we do a good job of doing that and going into Game 2 and playing with physicality and pace, we will have a good chance of winning Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"To all the Mavericks fans that traveled here, we appreciate you all and we love you, and we are going to try to get this win for you all and go back 1-1 to Dallas with the series tied."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Just staying positive. We've been in this situation before many times, just in this year. So I think for us just being positive and knowing how good we are as a team and just being aggressive."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"The same way that happened in OKC and in the Clippers series, making sure that we stay together as a team. Look at adjustments we need to make, and we have done that. Go over film and look at the mistakes we've made and just make a positive from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"It was great. Everybody dreams of being in the Finals. That first bit of getting the jitters out. It's amazing, amazing fans. It was a great atmosphere and it's what basketball is about."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. Our team is a very close team. Probably the closest team I've ever been on. It's a family. We have young guys. It's a young team. The guys, everyone really likes each other. I think that's what really helps our team is how connected we are and we are able to make adjustments. We are also able to talk openly about what we need to do to improve our game and how we can help one another."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,Not Luka. I don't know. Anyone but Luka.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"He does an amazing job. In his mind, it's another game. At the end of the day, we have one thing, and that's to win a championship. So I think he's done an amazing job of being a leader and a front-runner for this team. He's been a leader the whole year, and it really rubs off on the team and is contagious."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, a hundred percent. I think being nervous is completely normal, especially for me. So I think just being here and being a part of it, it's fun. To me, being nervous isn't a bad thing. But at the end of the day, now it's time for us to make sure we are doing everything we can to win."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"We need to be more aggressive, and we need to be way more aggressive. Looking back at every single one of these playoff series, we've been the aggressive team. And, yeah, just communication-wise. Just small things can really help out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I just think how together we are as a team. Like I said, the coaches do an amazing job of reacting to situations. Going back to the drawing board. Realize what we need to do as a team and be able to show the team, and I think the guys are good at making the adjustments we need to."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"For sure, I've seen a lot of things that we can adjust on and be better at. We have to push guys in, play inside the perimeter. That was pretty much just the main thing. Better transition defense and taking care of the ball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I have a lot of confidence in this team. We have always found ways to take that next step in the right direction, because we like having adversity and always came together instead of tearing apart. That's the main thing we focused on going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,We always get hit in the mouth in the first game. Leaves a bad taste in our mouths. We have to come out the next game to rinse that out.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Just the energy around it. We know that there are things that we can be better at from the first game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much every day, just like after media. We are going to be watching film after this. It's always easy to sit down and go through the things that we can obviously do better and be better at. When it comes to the coaches, we always kind of like joke around here, like, oh, do it again. But this is what it takes to be able to survive at this stage. This is the last series of the year for us. Survival of the fittest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Not necessarily. I feel like he took the right approach to everything he did. He was in foul trouble, but he stayed poised. A lot of guys, they will get in their own head, get aggravated, frustrated. He stayed with it, and that's something that shows maturity on his side just being a young guy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Just shows the better of the two sides. In the first half, we didn't really play good. We came out in the second half with our heads on straight. It just shows that we can take that step in the right direction, just put us in position to withstand for 48 minutes. We don't want to come out and just let anybody punch us in the face. We have to find ways to react the right way."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Be as physical as we were the first game. And just pray he doesn't make all his mid-range.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Really just have the confidence in our offense, making sure that we have poise and really just not getting sped up when it comes to the pace offensively. They are a scrappy team defensively. We have to find ways to get around that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think just be a little bit more aggressive. I think we all came out for the game with little energy. So I think we have to be better with our energy especially from the start."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"No, I don't think so. I mean, we talk about it, but we've just got to stay together. I think we talk about, too, we've got to talk more on the court than we did in Game 1. So that's got to be better from my side, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, it's big. This is the team that drafted me, and the team that believed in me. So I'm really happy to represent Dallas. Hopefully it's not the last time. But I think the whole Dallas [fan base] is proud of our team. So I'm happy to represent them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know, but I'm just trying to have fun. That's the game I love. That's the game that gets me paid. And nothing better in the world than playing basketball for your job. So just trying to enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,I already knew it. (Laughter).
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Not yet. I mean, not since he was -- he signed."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Slovenia.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, it just depends on how fast we get the ball up the floor. If we are walking the ball up the floor and we start the offense at 17 or whatever, it's different from you starting your offense at 20 because you've got the ball up the floor. So I think that goes into it, if you've got a little bit more time, maybe you can scan the floor a little bit. But for the most part, you want to kind of make quick decisions and keep the ball moving."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,I don't have no reaction.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I don't know. It's a team game. We're trying to focus on that, and, you know, everybody has their own opinions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,Say that one more time.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, coming out even more aggressive but even more disciplined. You know, Dallas is a really good team, and they have responded very well to Game 1 losses. They come back in Game 2. So we're going to get a forceful, more aggressive team on Sunday, tomorrow. We've got to be ready because they are really good after a loss. So we can't be surprised, and that's what I'm preparing my team for."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Just trying to keep them off balance. They got -- they are here for a reason. They are well-coached. They do their roles. They perform their roles well. So can't give them the same look every time because they are -- you know, the more comfortable they get, the better they are. So just try to keep them off balance."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I remember it being a pretty cool experience. I see some young guys in our league now, like walking around and stuff like that. I think that's pretty cool when I was -- it was before I got drafted, like you said, and I was still, you know, fresh out of college and, you know, I knew some -- because I played at Cal Berkeley, I knew some of the guys on the Warriors. Steve Kerr's son was my friend at Cal. I went to a lot of Warriors games that season. You know, I got to meet a lot of those guys and talk to a lot of those guys before I even got to the NBA. Mainly Andre Iguodala, who is like an older brother, mentor, to me now. But, you know, those experiences were everything. You know, being able to see what a winning environment looked like. Being able to talk to guys who have done things at the highest of levels and then give you encouraging words and wish you well and good luck. That was -- that was my experience in the NBA Finals in [2016] or whenever that was before I got drafted. I think that's part of the reason why I was able to get back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But we've been just extremely focused on what our roles and our jobs are. We have all had to sacrifice. Jason (Kidd) has had to do that at the highest of levels, right, and I respect him and tip his cap for it. Right now, at this point, it's whatever it takes to win and we can't let any outside interpretations try to get in between us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I thought the crowd was good. I think we can be a little bit better. So I expect us to be even louder. Sunday, we are going to need our fans to be hyped. It's not just team versus team. It's crowd versus crowd. It's gas station versus gas station. Supermarket versus supermarket. It's the whole city versus the whole city. We need everybody."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 8, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just watching film, taking your time. Seeing and reading the game. Being aggressive. Not hesitating. But also, you know, making the right plays. Like you said, being in the right spot. Spacing has a lot to do with that. Making sure our team is properly spaced, and then being aggressive from there. We expect them to be a lot more aggressive on defense, Dallas, coming out into this Game 2. So that's going to put an emphasis on us to be more disciplined. We have to get to our spacing well. We've got to make the right read. Got to take care of the ball. Can't do stupid fouls because we expect a great punch from them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"It's a little bit of everything. I mean, Joe kind of gives us the freedom to trust our instincts, and then you also know that, like, if someone gets beat, someone's going to have your back, and we just fly around after that. So just a little bit of everything and just competing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think, like, we just took a breath, stayed together, stayed composed, and just kind of got good looks offensively, moved the ball. We got good looks, and I feel like that close in the third was huge. Kind of just put 'em away, kept a distance. So credit to the guys that are out there just staying together, getting stops defensively, and making the right reads offensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, you never really know, coming back from injury. We just seen him -- all the hard work he's been putting in. But you, like, never really know, to miss all that time and come back for The Finals. But he was unreal today and it's nice to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, we just won one game. We know they're going to be better. I think we have seen it in the playoffs this year. Like, they have lost Game 1's and they came back and played better. So just it's one game. We got to learn from it, we got to grow, and understand that we're going to need to play a lot better Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"He's a matchup nightmare. Even when you play good defense, he doesn't really see you. It's been unreal just watching him all year. Then defensively, he uses his size well, just impacts the games in so many different ways. He changes us and he makes us a better team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, it can be anybody. I think it was JB that timeout. But Al, JT, Jrue. I can say, like, that's the great thing about this team, is if there's something that needs to be said, people are going to say it and we're willing to accept that and grow from it. So, I mean, it can be anybody that's playing. Like X [Xavier Tillman] has said stuff in the past that has helped us, so there's a lot of guys that have the voice and we're just learning and growing with each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, they're a really good team. They're going to make runs, they're going to make tough shots, they're going to -- I mean, they're going to make it difficult for us. We didn't expect it to be easy. I mean, I wish you could just stop it after, like, one point, that would be nice, but I think you just got to figure out why you're struggling and just try to limit those mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, JB'S unreal on the perimeter. I mean, blocking shots obviously he had two big-time blocks. He can just do everything on the basketball court and he has like no weaknesses on both sides. So, he's big-time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think anytime you go through something like that and all the experience that we've gathered through like the ups, the downs, like, all that has just helped us to be a better team. So we've learned from everything and, like, this core group has been together through a lot of adversity, so I definitely think it helps."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, those two are unreal, great players, great teammates, and they just do so many little things for us on both sides of the basketball, so it's amazing having them as our team on our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"It felt great. To be honest, I was nervous. I ain't going to lie. I was nervous in like an anxious way, as like a little kid. It's surreal being in The Finals. When you're young, I guess, in your career, you think you're always going to go back. Last year was kind of like a wake-up call when we didn't make it. So getting back to this point and being here is really a big deal. We played well tonight. There's a lot of things we feel like we could do better. But it definitely does feel good to win the first game. But we know that two years ago we won the first game and the outcome of that series. So we still have a lot of work to do."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I mean, you always want to have your team at full strength. We're a good team when guys are down, but we're really, really special when we have everybody. I said it earlier, how seamless his transition was after being away for six, seven weeks, and coming into the game and having a first half like that, that was a big spark for us to start the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,Thanks for reminding me.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think you guys got a pretty clear picture of that throughout the season, when we were healthy for most of that and how we played and how effective we were on both ends. KP had a big hand in that and the success that we had this season. Obviously, getting hurt in the playoffs, we had to figure it out. We had to adjust and play different lineups and whatever. 12-2 up to that point, we did a really good job. But it is a relief to have him back because we know we're a much better team when he's back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, and they go hand in hand. Al has stepped up into that starting role and at this stage in his career being a, you know, center piece of us getting to The Finals is something that shouldn't be overlooked. His presence out there on both ends of the floor, what he allows us to do offensively, dragging out the big men. You know, and we have had playoff games where Al has hit six, seven threes. Even if he doesn't, you have to, the other team has to respect him as a shooter, so it just helps with our spacing. So, can't give Al enough credit for the impact that he's had on this playoff run."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think when you look at JB, he's somebody that has really worked on his craft year after year to just become a better player. I think you can tell by the way that the game has slowed down for him and the way he's making reads on the offensive end. That doesn't happen just overnight, it's a process. And I've seen it, I've seen the work that he puts in and watching film and things like that. So it's special to see when guys put in the work and it translates to on the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Yeah, I think just, being his teammate for seven years, we've been in so many big games, we've been in so many big moments, and just always being there to answer the call in those moments, especially on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I think our offense got a little stagnant and it had a lot to do with our spacing. They kind of put us into some bad ways on offense which kind of threw off our spacing and slowed us down. They started to get stops, running in transition, but that's part of it. They're going to make shots. That's a really good team over there. We just did a great job of responding in realtime after Joe called that timeout. They cut it to eight, we came to the bench and talked about it, executed and made plays and took the lead back up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Just staying present, staying in the moment. Like I said, I was, in a positive way, I was nervous before the game. I was like a kid first day of school. I know how exciting and big of a deal all of this is, so just finding a space to enjoy the moment and have fun playing basketball."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Something that we have harped on all season, what makes our team really special is we don't have guys that we hide on defense. Bigs and guards, we switch, we take on the challenge of individual defense. Understanding that we have help, it's a team sport, we all got to be on the same page, but we're not showing or anything like that, because that could kind of compromise your defense. And, essentially, like, if you want to play on our team you have to be able to guard, and everybody knows that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"I don't want to say like -- I didn't doubt him, but I just, you know, coming off an injury and missing that much time, it normally takes guys a little longer than that, but as somebody as tall and talented as he is, he makes it look really easy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYSON TATUM,"Maybe last year, us losing in the Conference Finals. Maybe I just expected that after we lost in 2022 that it was guaranteed that we were just going to keep coming back, and this is like our time. Last year it was just kind of a wake-up call to not take anything for granted, because you never know how many opportunities that you might have."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Thank you all for being here. I want to begin with someone who is a familiar face at the Finals, and that's Bill Walton, who we lost last week. Of course, Bill won two championships but also covered multiple NBA Finals for NBC and then ABC. He and his wife, Lori, often sat, as many of you remember, at these press conferences, usually somewhere over there. I'm thrilled that Lori Walton is going to actually be at the game tonight, and Bill's four sons are going to be here, as well. The (Celtics) team was looking for a way to honor him tonight, and in addition to a pregame moment, the (Celtics) players are going to be wearing a special Bill Walton shooting shirt. So you're going to be seeing these shortly. The guys are going to be coming out and warming up in this jersey. We're happy about that. In addition, Bill was someone who became a very close friend in the over the 30 years that I've been with the league. Many of you in this room have been covering the league for a long time, as well, and he traveled with us everywhere we went. I remember the first time we played in China, in 2004, being on the Great Wall with him. He was quite an adventurer. I can't think of a better ambassador for the NBA than Bill. He enjoyed talking to every single person. Increasingly, internationally who understood he must have played basketball, wasn't quite sure who he was, and he would explain to them. But even some of you know, right up until this past season, he was working. He was doing an alternate telecast with us called Throw It Down, and even Bill sort of continued to cover the game, couldn't stop complimenting the current players. I think he saw the staggering ability of these young guys and was constantly complimenting them. Every generation of young player came to know him. And just lastly say he'll be (missed), and my condolences to Lori and his four boys. It's a sad moment in the league. Speaking of NBA's international presence, I know there are 26 different countries represented here today with media members, so I want to thank you for traveling so far to be here. In addition, these Finals will be carried in 214 countries and territories. This group of players will represent the largest contingent of international players ever we've had in the Finals; 13 players of the combined two teams were born outside of the United States. So the global growth of the NBA continues unabated. Basketball as a sport continues to grow enormously on a global basis. Wonderful to see how much is happening in the women's game, as well, in the WNBA here in the United States, and we're looking forward to the Paris Olympics, where basketball will be a mainstay, men's and women's. Another exciting time. It was interesting, I was watching Luka Doncic yesterday, just an example of how international this league is. Of course, someone who grew up in Slovenia and trained in Madrid and Spain and was doing interviews in three different languages. Again, many of you spend time with him, but he's an exemplar of the modern NBA. And with that, I'm happy to answer questions. I only speak one language, unfortunately, so please in English. Thank you again for being here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Well, just begin by saying I don't want to cover specifically on what's been written in the media other than to say, yes, absolutely. I would just say plural, where you say TV deal, it's TV deals. Of course, there's discussions with our incumbents and other interested parties. It is incredibly complex. I look at my colleague Bill Koenig sitting in the front row, president of our media division, who has been literally working around the clock on this, along with a team of others at the league office. And it's complicated for several reasons. One is the advent of new platforms, particularly streaming, and the interest of streaming companies, and then the traditional media companies also carrying our games on streaming platforms. It's complicated with multiple partners all seeking similar assets. In many cases, just figuring out the right way to balance those games as they go to different partners. Then lastly, as you've said, we tend to do long-term deals. We think that's good for the stability of the league, but it means to a certain extent you're trying to predict the future, which is of course impossible. So part of it is a bet on the partners that we will ultimately align with and their ability also to adjust with the times and their willingness to continue to invest in media and also become global, which to my earlier point is very important to the league, as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Sure. The advent of Team Ignite, for those of you who don't know, a team of younger players playing within the G League, in essence a select team, was in response to both President Obama, then at the time in office, who was pushing us hard and the basketball community to create a professional track for players who were not interested in playing college basketball, and at a time when they were not being compensated for playing college basketball. In addition, it was the result of conversations with Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, who was overseeing a committee on behalf of the NCAA, who made similar recommendations and said that I think our view was that these young men should not be forced somehow to go to college, if the only reason they were going to college was in preparation for the NBA as opposed to preparation for life. Our response was, we hear you, and we created this Team Ignite program. We were paying these players directly. I think Team Ignite served its purpose. I don't necessarily think that the changes in NIL, legislation and these ongoing changes in college sports were a direct result of it. I think it helped, though, demonstrate the value for these young players, but we got to the point now with Team Ignite where frankly we felt it didn't make sense to compete against these top college programs, where in many cases have better facilities, top-notch coaching, charter aircraft, et cetera. We thought this was a good time to step back and reassess what our role should be in junior basketball. Not just with the G League, but I'll add I've had some discussions with Charlie Baker, the head of the NCAA, about the joint role we potentially can play in helping even at a younger age helping develop top-flight youth basketball, boys, girls, young men, young women, in the United States in particular. I think that is something that we should focus on. It's interesting, as you look at the growing body of international players in the NBA, Luka Doncic as an example before, who in essence went on a professional track beginning at 13 with Real Madrid, there's clearly some improvement we could use in the U.S. system for the training of these elite players. There's no doubt they come into the league as some of the most skilled players in the world, but in many cases they haven't -- it's not that they haven't learned team basketball, but because of the way the system works, they're constantly changing teammates, they're jumping from program to program. You can tell that the international players in many cases are just learning a different style, and in some cases a more efficient and winning style of basketball, team play basketball than we're seeing in some of the U.S. programs. So I would add USA Basketball to the NCAA and the NBA and I'm sure that shoe companies have an interest in doing this, too. Pulling back on Team Ignite was just the beginning, but I think as we complete our media deals, for me this will be, and Mark Tatum, Deputy Commissioner, is sitting here, will be one of our next major projects. So we're really focused on what our role should be in youth basketball in the United States and globally, for that matter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"I'll leave the specific question about the foul to my colleague, Commissioner (Cathy) Engelbert. Other than as a fan, obviously it's nothing new in basketball that there's sort of ""welcome to the league"" moments, especially for heralded rookies, but of course I want to see Caitlin treated fairly and appropriately in the league. I would say it seems like she can take care of herself. She's a tough player. I think it may be lost on some people that are new to basketball, in terms of a little bit of controversy in the WNBA, what an incredible talent she is: two Final Fours, leading scorer in the history of college basketball. I look forward to watching her ongoing development in the league. I think ultimately this is very healthy for women's basketball and the WNBA. It's generating tremendous additional interest. In fairness to the other players and in fairness to Commissioner Engelbert, this didn't just start this year. Certainly we're seeing an acceleration of it with Caitlin, but many individual stars who came in this league in the last several years. And then, again, I've been with the league for a long time. So I was there in the early days with Val Ackerman, and of course David Stern, when we developed the WNBA. In some ways, to me, this was a long time coming. If you went back and looked at our original business plan from 28 years ago, we didn't think it would be such a long timeline to break into the popularity we're seeing now. Ultimately, I don't want to make too big of an issue about one particular player, one particular call. But I think the burgeoning rivalries within professional basketball, you see rivalries obviously among clubs but also among individual players, too, and I think that can be ultimately good for the sport. But at the same time, there's also some larger societal issues at work. There's no doubt. I don't want to hide from that. Some having to do with race, and they're very apparent. I think sports historically has been a platform for people to talk directly about these issues. I don't think we should hide from them, and I think the players are happy to engage on these issues. They're sophisticated people. But ultimately let the public join part of those conversations, as well, and of course the media will weigh in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Well, part of it, I don't want to sound overly confident, it has much to do with watching where media is moving, where top-notch content now that we're seeing on the various streaming platforms, the fact that maybe Netflix being the latest in terms of their Christmas Day deal for NFL games, that many of these platforms that only six months or a year ago that were reluctant to come to premium live sports are now jumping in. If you watch where the eyeballs are going, and I'm sure it's true for people in this room, as well, we're all moving into watching premium programming on streaming services. Also, part of where my confidence goes in moving sports over to streaming platforms and something I've talked about before, it allows for tremendous additional functionality when it comes to watching games, personalization, customization of games, multiple feeds, multiple dialects, multiple languages, different camera angles. It really gives the fan enormous additional choice that you don't have through traditional television. Trying to predict how fast this will move is I think what's so difficult. I think there's been a faster decline in cable viewership, cable usage and viewership than people were predicting even only two years ago, and the move is happening fast to streaming services. So what we're trying to do as part of these television deals is middle sort of the use still of the broadcast platform. Of course, the Finals are on ABC in the United States. Still matters tremendously to us. Traditional cable, it's not going away, but it's continuing to decrease. And then streaming platforms are seeing accelerated growth, particularly around premium live sports. We're sort of trying to put foot, hand, finger in sort of every one of those buckets."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"The last part of your question, on changing those incentives in terms of draft picks, that's something we continue to look at. I think just more generally, incentives for teams are something that we continue to examine, modify, calibrate and look for ways to better align incentives. All of that goes to whether it's the Play-In Tournament, changes in the Draft Lottery, changes in the collective bargaining agreement. I think that's an ongoing effort. In terms of what Dallas did last year, we sanctioned them. We did what we thought was appropriate at the time. I would only say that the success they saw this season, that they're now seeing in the Playoffs and here they are at the Finals, I don't attribute it to one draft pick, as important as that draft pick has been to their team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Look, I'd say Pat McAfee, that's what you're referring to, he apologized, and I accept that. I think that the way media works these days, when people are online for hours, they're going to occasionally misstep. I think what's important is the context, their intention and sort of what they're willing to say about having done that. I leave it to ESPN to make their own personnel decisions about what the consequences of things like that. But I accept sort of in a free society, where there's a lot of conversation, a lot of dialogue, and I think it's for the WNBA, of course, it's going to be a two-edged sword. Many of us in this room go back to David Stern, where we sat in meetings and he was pleading with some of the very reporters sitting her to cover the WNBA and women's basketball. Now we're being covered, and once you get covered in an extensive way, it's a little bit of a product of how media works these days, that you're going to see occasional statements that people aren't happy with. But I think that my sense is at least what I read, the player accepted the apology. I think in the context of how he said it, I think matters a lot these days. I don't want to get into sort of the cliched cancel culture debate. But I worry about that, that sort of this notion that if somebody seems to be a person of goodwill is saying things that in the context seem actually supportive of the player but says a word like that, that we all say shouldn't have been said, and he's the first to acknowledge he shouldn't, I don't want to overblow it. I think that we can move on from it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Bill Koenig, can you tell me when the media deals will be over so I can begin the expansion process? (Laughter.) In all seriously, I meant what I said. We do need to finish up -- I think I said a few years ago, collective bargaining agreement, new media deals, then we would turn to expansion. So we got part one done clearly, and thank you to the Players Association. We are very happy, I think both sides are, with our collective bargaining agreement. Media deals, it's been a long process. It's ongoing, and we hope to wrap it up in the relative near term, and then we will turn to expansion. But by turning to expansion it doesn't mean we're going to announce that now we're ready to add teams. It means that there will be a committee of NBA governors that will focus on it. There are clearly markets out there that are very interested and will run through a process. But I actually am looking forward to that. I think that the league, it's not preordained that we will expand this time, but I know there's an enormous amount of interest out there. And to me, yes, there are wealthy individuals, institutions that would like to invest and buy NBA teams, but I think it's on the league to look holistically because there is the dilution, of course."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"I'm absolutely fine with that. It's interesting, times change. There used to be concerns even geographically of players from a certain part of the country and how will they feel about that player in that market, because the player played for a top college somewhere else or from somewhere else. I think it's increasingly a global league in that wherever that player is from, and Luka Doncic is a great example, Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee, I think if that player becomes part of that community, lives in that community, gives of himself or herself in the WNBA to that community, I think they become part and parcel. I don't think it's any different that I went to Duke University and when a player is playing for Duke and Duke fans are all in, they're not so focused on where that player is from, whether in the United States or Luol Deng or other players from outside the United States. It's a global market. At the same time, I will say to my earlier point, it is important that we focus on proper development of American players. I just think for the sport, still we're a U.S.-based business, the majority of our revenue still comes from the United States. I feel an obligation to the game, as well, and I know I speak for the head of the NCAA, who played college basketball. Over time, like for example, we're up to about 30 percent of our players are international. When you think about the amount of basketball being played globally and the U.S. is a little less than 5 percent of the global population, that number of international players will only rise. Statistically, you're going to see more top-notch international players in the league. It doesn't mean, though, that there won't still be great U.S. players, many of whom we're going to see on the court tonight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"It has been difficult. That show in particular is special. I have a close relationship with everyone who's on that show, from the time they played in the league, as well, and Ernie and I have been friends forever. At the same time, it's not just the talent, of course. You've been in production yourself. There's hundreds of longtime people who have been involved with what I still refer to as Turner Sports, who have been longtime friends and colleagues, and no different at the other networks. On one hand, from the league standpoint, it's fantastic to be liked and to be wanted and to have multiple suitors. At the same time, it makes me uncomfortable that it's zero sum, that at the end of the day there's only going to be so many television packages, there's only so many Finals games and playoff games and regular-season games to distribute. I will say directly from me, directly to your question and the people who seem to be most impacted right now, the folks at Turner Sports, I apologize that this has been a prolonged process, because I know they're committed to their jobs. I know people who work in this industry. It's a large part of their identity and their family's identity, and no one likes this uncertainty. I think it's on the league office to bring these negotiations to a head and conclude them as quickly as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"In terms of the last part of your question, we're not considering right now opening up control of teams to institutional capital. We think it's still very important that there be individuals and ultimately a singular governor who has ultimate decision making for a team. We've seen examples historically where, putting aside institutions, there have been multiple individuals, and it's led to all kinds of contention and controversy. So I don't see that happening, at least in the foreseeable future. In terms of institutional capital being invested in teams, in some ways it's a good problem to have, as you said, as the value of these teams continue to grow and grow at a fast pace. There are only so many individuals literally in the world who can cut those sort of checks to invest in the majority of capital required to purchase these teams. So we think we've found ourselves in a pretty good spot where you have individuals with control pieces of team, other individuals who are investing alongside of them, but then to complete the cap chart, you have institutional investors. The institutional investors, of course because the values are going up right now, seem very pleased with those investments. I think historically we were concerned, before we allowed institutional investors, that they would be short-timers and that they would be looking to quickly flip their investments. We haven't seen that. In fact, this is your area, not mine, from the Financial Times, that it's become more sort of permanent capital in a way as opposed to being short-term investments. The investment community is looking now at sports teams, particularly premium sports teams, not just the NBA, as an investment category in a diversified portfolio that in many cases moves in an alternative ways from the market as a whole. It rounds out a portfolio and it seemingly is working well for everyone right now. Lastly, I'll just say that this policy is only a few years old. Institutional investors who don't comply with our current policy, some particular funds have been in to see us, and to say we would like to be an investor in your league or in teams, and would you consider adjusting some of your policies, not necessarily to allow us to be a control owner, maybe they would like that one day, but in other ways, to ease up some of the restrictions, and that's something that we'll continue to look at. By the way, I know the NFL is looking at some of these same issues right now, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"First of all, as you said, that's an ongoing process in terms of the arbitration. That was a process they agreed to in the purchase agreement. The league office is completely independent of that. Yes, the next step, were they to win that arbitration, would be then to continue through the league vetting process, and then ultimately what would be required would be a vote of the Board of Governors to approve them as owners."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"The only reason I won't comment on that is because that would be obviating the entire vetting process that needs to continue, and then is ultimately for the owners to take that vote."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"It may impact things if we were now at the point where they had won the arbitration and the group was being vetted for ownership. But as far as I know, and I only -- I don't have personal knowledge of that deal, I read it, as well, that's independent of the issues that are now at issue in the arbitration."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"When it comes to injury data, we're constantly studying it, trying to see if there's more than correlation and there's actually causation. Of course, this past season, even though we had the 65-game rule, largely designed to keep star players on the floor, we had a decrease in injury in star players. I'm not standing here saying one followed from the other. It just may be happenstance for this season. I think we saw injuries, of course, in the Playoffs this year, but nothing that out of range with injuries we've seen in the past. I think, look, there's nothing more important than keeping our players on the floor. One of the things I know Andre Iguodala and I, it's great having him now as the head of the Players Association, just based on his experience as a star player in this league, a championship-caliber player, that we're trying to step back and say, what is it that we need to do to incentivize guys to play and keep them healthy, and are there things we need to adjust in the schedule, are there other areas. You're talking about the Playoffs now that we look at. I will say just based on one season of data, we're happy with the 65-game rule. There was sort of a parade of horribles that had rolled out, that had been rolled out, that everybody was saying, were threatening were going to happen. Those things didn't happen. In terms of not just a reduction in star player injuries this year, but it worked to the extent we saw star players on the floor more. That was the goal. Whether there's some connection in terms of additional injuries and Playoffs, we don't know. This is an area that confounds us in some ways. I will say that we worked with the players successfully in the collective bargaining agreement on this issue, and I think with Andre's leadership, sort of a commitment on both sides, let's keep looking at it. We have the same incentives, and that is to keep star players on the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,"Fair question. It's where we should be able to make the most progress. As I've said before, you're always going to have human error in the case of referees. It doesn't mean we can't continue to do a better job training officials. But when it comes to technology, again, it's one of the things we've been talking to the Players Association a lot about and the Referees Association, too, and I'm thinking once the season ends this year, maybe we even put together a task force of the constituent groups. A guy named Evan Wasch in the League Office is leading this initiative. We're in discussions with Hawkeye, the technology they use in tennis. As I've said for a while, it's harder than I understood it to be, but if there's a category of objective calls that you can not only take off the floor but frankly out of the replay center. Buzz, Celtic ball, because it's automated, foot on the line, which one of the hundred fingers on the floor touched the ball last at that time. As I said they're working through that. But technology will solve that, and I think it's the same for replay."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",ADAM SILVER,I'm not going to get into that only because it's a complex legal issue.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, I think obviously what helped me is just even from the walk out before the game and then getting on the court, getting that kind of support was unreal. The adrenaline was pumping through my veins and that definitely helped. Obviously it wasn't ideal that I was out for such a long time, but I did everything I could to prepare mentally for this moment coming back and it paid off and we got the job done tonight and had a good game and happy about the result."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, from day one I came here and I said like I'll do whatever it takes to help this team win, right? I think it was -- this situation, you know, it made sense. I didn't care. I didn't care. I knew I could prepare to come off the bench, which is something different for me, and that's what I did and stepped into that role and embraced it and had a good game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no. Yeah -- what was the question? (Laughing.)"
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, at the end of the day, it's like, it's just basketball. It's okay, it's high intensity, it's like more -- you know, like, intricacies of the game and stuff, like, more focus on little details. But at the end, it's just basketball and I've been doing this for a long time. Even if I have time off, I can jump right back in and I feel the same way. I get to my spots and I do, so whether it's playoffs regular season or whatever, I know how to do this. That's it, just having that confidence, going out there whatever, first round or Finals, just going out there with full confidence and giving what I have to the team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"You know, even when that first quarter when I checked in and start things going my way and stuff, I didn't even think about it. I was so in the moment and enjoying the moment and the crowd and everything, you know. I don't know, it's kind of like a blur to me right now. I have to re-watch the game, what happened and stuff, but I was completely just in the game. That's the best feeling. Like, I had the most fun and, yeah, and I hope to have more of those moments going forward."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not in a sense of, like, am I going to be okay. Like, it was only like physical. Am I going to be good to go physically, not -- skills-wise, there was never -- at least for me never no doubt. But of course, you have ups and downs throughout the game, like all this stuff happens, but mainly for me, it was to get there physically and once I felt pretty good and the medical staff had my back and we did everything correct to get to this point, then they gave me the green light, I was good to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, we had a conversation and just came up to me, I know he knew I was going to be fine with whatever, you know, so he just told me, what do you think, like about this, and I said, of course, like, let's do it. And that's it. Wasn't no big deal and I trust Joe and he trusts me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I don't know, but Joe always gives us the right message, you know what I mean? He himself is very almost -- like, he can be emotionless if that's what we need and he can just come in, like, completely even keel and give us the right message of what to focus on. And then he can come in and give us some motivation if that's what we need in that moment, some energy. But I think there he was just even keel and giving us some of the answers to what we need to do out there and that was it, we trust him with his leadership."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"I mean, a little bit of everything. A little bit of everything, right. It's tough to not play for a month and then jump into the highest intensity game in The Finals, it's obviously very tough. But as I said, I did everything I could to prepare for this moment, like mentally, and then just going out there and playing instinctually almost, you know, and trusting my body. And that was it. And as I said, like the support around me was great to get to this moment, and now, yeah, we just have to keep going and take care of business."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just thought it gave us the best chance to win. He was great on both ends of the floor, defensive execution, game plan, playing for a spot in the offensive end, being physical, and making plays on both ends of the floor. So I thought he played great and that's the KP that helped us get to where we are today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, just poise. They have a great defensive system, great defensive team, throw a bunch of stuff at you, different spacings, different coverages. The poise to just figure it out. Make the right play is going to be the most important thing. I thought he had that throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, game management is going to be important. This is a great team. They have a tendency to go on great runs. That's going to happen. You have to be able to manage those with poise and execution, know why those runs are being made, and quickly put a stop to them with high-level execution. So KP was a huge part of that, that run. But I liked the way we handled their run, because that's going to happen. You're not going to stop that. You just have to have the poise and the toughness to work through it and I thought our guys did that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"What you saw tonight is kind of the challenge he took for himself coming into the year. Not wanting to be defined by one thing. Wanting to make plays. Wanted to be a well-rounded player and get better and better. So his spacing, his ball movement, his defense on ball and off ball. Usually when you give up a run and your offense gets a little stagnant, your defense goes with it. Tonight our defense kept us in it and that's really important, to have that defensive mindset. Some of those plays that Jaylen made were a part of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think a couple of great passes. JT stuck out, the one Jaylen threw to Al in the corner. I think it was either Jaylen or JT. But that's what those guys do, they have the ability to draw two guys and the most important thing is making the right play over and over again, doing what's best for the team, reading the two on ones, and when they're at their best, those guys are able to do that. I thought their decision making helped control the game, especially when they went on that run and we were able to get that back. We went back to -- with JT there and he was able to help us sustain that with a high-level execution, so that's really important when those guys do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I always talk to the players about what we think is best for the team and that it's that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,I don't know. I can't remember.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"The one when they cut it to eight? Yeah, listen, it's the NBA Finals, you're playing against a great team and they're going to make runs. Just building on awareness to why the run was made and, you know, that team does a great job of making defensive adjustments on the fly and sometimes it takes us a possession or two to recognize that. So just understanding the run, what could we do to change it, and how can we get better coming out of that. So I thought the guys' poise out of that timeout was big and that's going to happen. They're going to go on more runs and we're going to have to fight through 'em."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,Yeah.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, again, I thought our defensive mindset, our defensive execution, our defensive game plan, our positioning, we had the right intentions and I thought we played really physical, for the most part, defending without fouling. And on the offensive end, we made some physical drives, and so that's the key there, is just having the physical mindset on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, listen, I know the story line has to be, what's he going to look like because he was off for a month, but that's what he's been doing his whole career. He's a great player. He's been great for us. The reason why we are here is because of what he's done. It doesn't matter how long he takes off, the guy is going to make plays because of how talented he is and the work he puts in. What he did for us tonight was big and we need that for the rest of the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Um-hmm, yes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Out of the three minutes, two and a half of it they're by themselves, so I'm sure -- they communicate well with each other, they have great relationships, so I'm sure during the time the coaches are meeting that they're having that communication with each other. They do a good job of communicating with each other throughout the game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just sticking with the game plan. Game plan execution's very important. Having a clear understanding of what you have to take away on every possession, and just knowing that in order to defend these guys at a high level, you have to play efficient offense, and I thought we did that for the majority of the game, obviously, on the run. There weren't many live ball turnovers and we missed some open shots. They forced us into a couple tough shots, but we were able to manage the transitions of the game with our offensive execution and our defensive game plan."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Listen, they're going to make a lot of adjustments and they're going to do a lot of great things because of the talent that they have, so we have to execute the game plan, communicate coverages, communicate matchups, guys did a great job communicating to each other and keeping defense first."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Just great individual defense. Everybody has to take on the challenge of guarding those guys. They're an amazing team and they put a ton of pressure on you with their ability to score. Everyone is going to take their matchup personal, have personal pride in individual defense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,He's not on a minutes restriction and we haven't gone through that yet.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Same thing he's done for us all year. Defense, offense, communication, play hard. Just what he's done for us over the course of the season that's helped us get here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, Jaylen is the kind of guy that just works hard, has a chip on his shoulder. I would say everything is motivation for him. I enjoy watching him when he works. He has a huge growth mindset and he's going to look to dig deep into weaknesses that he wants to get better at, makes his strengths better, never skips a detail. I would say he's one of the higher-motivated guys I've seen, just the way he works."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"No. We just talked to the staff, just Celtics, practice, getting better, and that's it really."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Honestly, same way every game day has looked. It's no different. We've got to rebound, we've got to sprint back, we've got to play defense, pay attention to detail. We have to pay attention to spacing, we have to execute, we have to crash. We've got to play hard. I can honestly say it hasn't looked any different, and the things that will go into winning this series are no different than the things that we talked about in preseason, habits, mindset, details, execution."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Same as they were first game of preseason, got to go out there and play. There's a game plan. We've got to be ready to execute it. But there's going to be adjustments, variables, things you're going to have to go through. In the short time I've been around I've been in some big games. The things that go into winning and losing are still the same. We can't be distracted by anything else. We've got to make sure we stick to those details. That's the most important thing."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I think it's all the fundamentals of that are the same. You have to communicate. You have to build relationships with people. You have to have a great staff around you. You have to have great players. You have to get those players better. You have to empower people around you. You have to know whatever level you're at what goes into winning and what could lead to losing. I think no matter the level, it's all the same, and obviously each level presents different types of challenges, but you rely on those things that can be translated regardless of where you're at to help you, and it's the people around you and the way you can build relationships."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, he's a great player. They have a great team. There's no one way to guard these guys, especially when you have to play them over again. So you have to be open-minded to go into different things, absolutely. But the game is connected, so the offensive adjustments we make will be in large part by how we defend and our defensive adjustments we make will be in large part how we attack, and the game is connected, and those decisions are made by kind of those things, how one thing affects the other. But I don't anticipate one solution. You have to have multiple solutions."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I thought give the Celtics credit. They did a great job defending, making it tough on us. We had some good looks that didn't go down. We've got to move the ball. The ball just stuck too much. And we'll be better in Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought he had great looks that just didn't go down. He had some great looks at three. He had some great looks in the paint. That's just part of basketball. Sometimes they go in. Sometimes they don't. Tonight, they just didn't go down for Ky or most of the team, and hopefully we get those same shots in Game 2 and we can be better."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, KP was great, he knocked down shots. He changed shots. He blocked shots. He gave them a spark when he came off the bench. We've just got to make it a little bit tougher on the offensive end. We've got to make him do something different. He got great looks and knocked them down."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, we did cut it to eight and got the rebound and unfortunately came up with a travel. A lot of good things in that third and fourth that we can build on. That's what we talked about after the game and that's what we have to do. We came out and won the third. Had a great opportunity to cut into that lead. Unfortunately, they go on a run. Once we cut it to eight, but then you know we won the fourth. So there are two positive things that we can take from these four quarters. We've got to be better in the first. They took advantage of that. They knocked down threes. But the big thing is, we have to be better as a team offensively and defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,They did great. They did great. And they will get better as the series goes on.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think this is the best team in the NBA and they are good for a reason. They play their style of basketball at a high rate. They generated 27 threes there in the first half, and made I think 11 of them. So we have to be better. We can't give them seven made threes in the first quarter. That would have outscored us with only scoring 20. So we have to be better. Give them credit. They were good tonight. But again, we've got to be better. Nerves or not being in this situation, we can't use that as an excuse. It's just basketball, and we've got to be better at the game of basketball on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I thought the group handled it well. At halftime, we talked about what we had to do, and I thought we did that coming out in the third. Again, cutting that lead, getting it to eight with the ball. Unfortunately, we traveled. And then from that point on, they took control of the game. But I thought the group responded. I thought we were better in the second half, and hopefully we can build on that third and fourth quarter going into Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"I think it's just about the positives. What can we do to build on the positives. We'll talk about that tomorrow. Understanding the small things, the physicality. We have to be better at that. But just looking at the positives. Looking at the things that we can control, and then we'll build from there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"We talked about it at halftime. I thought we weren't having fun there in the first half and we talked about having fun, to work the game, to continue to keep playing. There's a lot of time. A lot of people will talk about one game but we are talking about a series. So the bigger picture is to continue to keep working in the series and I thought the guys did a really good job there in the third quarter. We get the miss. We get the rebound. The momentum is going our way. Unfortunately, we traveled. So we just have to be better. We know that. Boston is a really good team, and so we've got to be better on Sunday."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think it's a great number. Also lets you know that the G League is doing the right thing. The development of the G League and being able to have those players participate on the biggest stage. Again, 22? That's a lot. That's a great honor, and hopefully one of them can have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, you're talking about the second-best defense. We saw the best defense in Minnesota, so now we're going against the second best. Understanding they have a lot of great defenders one-on-one, so we expect that they're going to continue to throw different bodies at Luka and Ky. Those two as our quarterbacks have to be able to read who's guarding them and then being able to get the right guys in the pick-and-roll. We truly believe those two will make the right decisions, but when you talk about individual defense, Boston is one that will read a lot of the pick-and-rolls but also in isos just play one-on-one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I think there's a lot of different paths. I'm happy when you talk about Hurley being mentioned as a candidate, JJ being mentioned, two different paths that could become head coaches in this league. Both basketball IQs extremely high. Whoever the Lakers choose, it's up to them. But when you talk about championships, Hurley has won two at UConn. I've gotten to play with Hurley in high school. He is a warrior. He's a champion. Coaching runs deep in their blood in that family. So if he was to become a Laker, that's incredible for him and his family but also for the Lakers. But JJ also has a basketball IQ and understands how to play the game the right way, and so either candidate is going to be great for the Lakers to choose from, but the path, there's a lot of different paths. Mark Jackson set the path for us, who’ve gotten older, who could not move, to figure out what we can do next. So when you talk about the path, Mark Jackson set the path. I'll always thank Mark privately that he gave us old-timers a chance to do something and still be involved in the game at a high level, and so I chose that path and I got lucky that the owners believed that I could do it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, that's a great question. I haven't really thought about that -- 2011, at the end of that game, just understanding what -- there's no one else to play. We're playing our best basketball, and being rookies, we didn't really know how to celebrate winning a championship. But when you sit there and you digest the situation of understanding that you just won a championship, it's just surreal because as a kid that's what you dream about. As a kid, you're watching Game 1 Boston against Dallas, and that's all you're working for is to be able to win a championship because you want to be like Magic, you want to be like Mike. To be able to do that in '11 was incredible. It's something that I will always treasure. That group of guys that we're linked to with Rick Carlisle as a coach, who led us was incredible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It's no different than the Western Conference stage. It's basketball. It's just a little bit more of you guys. But to embrace, as I talked this morning before we started talking about Boston, was the guys who get all the attention or most of the attention, share it with the younger guys who aren't getting interviews. When it is time for them to get interviewed, they know how to handle it. I just shared that with the team this morning, to understand Ky and Luka, this is also a great time to share how to handle things with the younger players because a lot of them haven't been in this situation. Luka has been in this situation since he was born. Ky has been in this situation for a couple times now. For those guys to be able to share it with them is my message. The basketball message is it's basketball, to have fun and embrace it and enjoy it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Ky and Luka as our quarterbacks, the respect that we have for one another, understand we all three have played the same position. Those two are a little bit more gifted than I am. The trust for one another for Ky -- myself, I've known Ky since I played in New Jersey, to see his journey, he's a champion. He's won, and now has us back into the Finals on the biggest stage. He's always enjoyed this situation. He always gets to celebrate his birthday first, even though we're born on the same day. But just to understand what he's gone through, that you can grow from different situations, and he's definitely done that, and he's really embraced Dallas, and he's playing his best basketball yet."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think when you talk about Al's journey, it's been incredible. It just seems like he's getting younger. He's been on great teams. He's always been a great teammate from afar, from what I've heard. Just understanding his skill set, being able to guard everyone on the floor as a teammate, being able to also stretch the floor, being able to shoot the three, and so longevity, he's doing something right when you talk about eating and taking care of your body and also mentally, because it can become draining. It can become where maybe I want to get on with my life and do something different. But again, his goal is to try to win a championship. Our goal is to try to delay that. But again, he's going to be one that's going to have an impact in this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, they've seen every coverage just like Luka and Ky, so we've got to be able to change it up. We can't give them a steady diet of one thing. They'll pick you apart. Again, when you get multiple bodies on the ball, that's when the three comes into play. Hopefully we can stay out of that situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Laugh. No, I think that's a great question. I think when you talk about at 21, you're naïve in understanding that you think you're going to win a championship because of Jimmy [Jackson] and Jamal [Mashburn], and you've got three young babies out there, and you forget about MJ and all the other great players in the league, John Stockton, Karl Malone. At that time the 21-year-old would say that you have to be crazy to get into coaching. But to continue to keep working on your craft and understanding at some point you're going to be able to help a group of young men win a championship. I would have believed that, and I was hoping that I could get them across the finish line."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Just grateful for the experience to get through Game 1. You know, just a lot of emotions going into it. Just waiting for the opportunity to get out there and compete. You know, going against a great Celtics team. We just have to get this one out of the way. We didn't perform the way we would have wanted to tonight. It starts with me just being able to get out there and get us settled. Got to take some accountability for just the communication, and just going out there and getting used to the way that the kind of environment was going to be. But I think my teammates did a great job of staying together, sticking to the game plan. We obviously made some mistakes, like I said, but we gave ourselves a chance in the second half and we just have to continue to do the right things and win the quarters as much as we can. They came out and hit us in the mouth early. Got the home crowd going into it. Down 17 in the first quarter. It's not really like us to give up 37 points. It's happened to us before in the playoffs, but we just wanted to make it a lot tougher on them. They hit a lot of threes. Again, when you get them rolling like that, they play a very easy game the rest of the game, and we've just got to hit them in the mouth a little bit. They did their job getting Game 1, but we are going to take our lessons and get ready for a good Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I don't necessarily agree it's a trap they want to set us. I think that they really rely on their great defensive ball pressure and one-on-one defenders. They funnel us into certain areas. Even as I say that, they are relying on the one-on-one, every time I got an iso, there's almost two, three people waiting for me to get in there. I have to catch the ball on a live dribble and just be aware of my opportunities. It's uncharacteristic for us to have only nine assists. The ball has got to move a little bit more. And again, that starts with me just being able to push the pace, get us some easy opportunities, and just adjust to what they are throwing at us. It's a fun series. It was fun going into the game. It's still going to be fun. But there's going to be a level of chess that still has to be played. And Game 1 was just about adjustments. We obviously wanted to win this basketball game. Gave ourselves a chance in the second half when we were down by eight, and they brought it up to 16 and they got it up to 22 and we called a timeout. So just going to be replaying some of these possessions. But at the same time, looking at some of the positives that we can carry on to Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"It's basketball at the end of the day. You know, being in this environment, I'm used to it at this point. Early in my career, there was a different relationship that I had with Boston and just being able to come here, be settled with a veteran group. Now I'm here as a veteran, over the past few years, just experiencing the playoffs here, even regular season, it's been the same thing. I thought it was going to be a little louder in here but I'm expecting the same things going into Game 2. Crowd trying to get me out of my element, my teammates out of my element. But again, the energy has to be focused towards the game. I felt like I had a lot of great looks. They hit back rim or were just a little left or right. Just got to stay confident and stay poised throughout this, man. This is the best time of the year to be playing. There's only two teams left. Let's put it in perspective. The environment is going to be what it is but my focus is on our game plan and making sure my guys feel confident and I feel confident and continue to shoot great shots."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Very proud of them and amazed at how poised they are. This younger generation has a quiet confidence and a knowing about themselves. I think when we hit a little adversity, we have to know how to respond as a group and as a team. We talked about it in a lot of huddles but we have to act on it. That's what this game is about is controlling our actions, making sure that we stay positive, but also know what we are going up against, the competition level. We are the best in the world at this point. There are only two teams left. We have proven why we deserve to be here and we've earned our right to be here. It's no time to see ourselves as a short opponent or someone that's not capable of coming out of this. It's Game 1, but at the same time, we've got two days in between. So there's going to be a lot of noise and a lot of who played well, who didn't play well, who was under pressure. Just telling my guys, now is not the time to fall into that and be divided and be on social media all day listening to people that are not on the court with us. No disrespect to anybody but we are the players out there and we have to control what we can control and be ready to put on for each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Just settle in emotionally and just continue to pinpoint the things that were working for us where we are funneling their guys to where we want them to go and offensively playing off a live catch. They do a good job of loading up when we are on the dribble. They do a lot of reaching, a lot of verticality, effort. We have to give them credit. We are going against a great team and now is the time to just look at film, spend the next two days healing up and just getting ready for a physical Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Again, just look at film and then also be ready to wash our hands of what this game was and how we didn't rise to the occasion to start off the game. Just be able to battle with them during those runs. They are going to make some threes at times but we want to make them tough. When they are at home, they shoot incredibly well. We knew what we were getting ourselves into but until we experience it, then we wouldn't know. This is the first time this group is experiencing the Finals. We don't want to use that as an excuse. We want to use that as a strength. We want to use that energy that we have of just going into it and playing our game to our advantage, and then, you know, we'll see how the chess pieces fall in."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, it's not the first time I've lost in Boston. I don't want to continue to make it a habit but they've had a few games over me and they have our number -- not our number, I don't want to say our number but the past few teams I've been on, they have had my number a little bit. You have to give credit to a good team. They have been good the past three or four years. We want to show them respect but at the same time we want to bring our best game. We have to play four of our greatest games in order to win the series and in order to win the Finals. It's not about holding our heads up for one game if we didn't play well. It's the first to four and we obviously know that, but we have to play four complete games, four of our best games, and then we'll see where we stand after that. But in the meantime, we've got to look ourselves in the mirror and it starts with me as one of the leaders on the team, how can I be better and how can I be more poised in this environment. It's not the booing and it's not the missed shots. It's more or less our attitude and how we approach possession by possession. Our identity has been made on the defensive end. We have proven that. I have not had the best games offensively this playoff run but we have been able to get stops, timely stops and been able to pick each other up on the offensive end. We have all-world talent on this team, skillset is out of this roof, but now it's just about remaining confident and always knowing that you have somebody that's been through it but now it's our turn to go through it together. You know, this is what makes it exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, yeah, it's hard to compare just because you're going against different players, different series. But I will say that the next day was pretty cool, you know, because to see us still joined together in practice, still go through our day-to-day routines and rituals, and just hold each other up and hold each other accountable but in a very healthy way. We are very honest about what we can continue to do better and then we are very honest about how we can coach one another to be better. We are going to hear the familiar sentiment or familiar phrase that a lot of guys haven't experienced the Finals on our team, and that's okay. Experience is the best teacher, and once you get Game 1 out of the way or Game 2 out of the way you start feeling better about the series. But when you lose Game 1, there is a level of disappointment. We are human. I've always said that. We are going to feel the natural emotions. You feel the highs and lows of the journey but when you lose a game like this especially in the Finals where everyone is watching, it's going to hit you a little bit. But again, like I say, now is the time to not get on social media and not pay attention to what you guys are saying, no disrespect, but we've got to go out there and just focus on what we can control. I just know how the next two days are going to go. It's going to be very loud. It's going to be very chaotic at times. People are going to have words to say about how we can be better and how we can win or lose the series. Again, it's about us focusing on what we can control in that locker room, and we have great leaders in that locker room. So it's not just me who has that the experience that I'm going to be leaning on. I'm going to be leaning on everybody to help me out, too, as I help them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,It felt good. I think the whole key for us was to come out and defend home court and establish ourselves and we did that.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Everyone was really locked in on the defensive end. The things that we needed to do, we just wanted to be very solid throughout. KP got to an unbelievable place there early in the first half, in the first quarter, and I just felt like it really got us going and took us to another level as a team. That was huge for us."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It was great. I was pleasantly surprised to see how good he looked. He was very fluid and a lot of energy and moving well. We know he can score, but defensively he looked really good as well."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I mean, we’ve kind of known. At the end of the day for us, we understood what the mission was in front of us and what we needed to do. Everyone here was on board."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"It feels good to win. But just know that the job’s not done. Never getting too high, too low. Just knowing that we’ve got (to win) Sunday and then two more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think we set the tone early. That kind of gave us the lead and then when they made their hit, they got it within eight, we could withstand it and push it back up to 20. So we did a good job of just being poised."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,It takes a lot. Lock into the game plan. Two great scorers and playmakers in Luka and Kyrie. It takes a lot. It takes a full team.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,Him being him. It was good to see it. You see him go out there and have fun. He brings energy to the game. And how he plays is so fun to see. Glad he’s on my side.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think Jayson is just being Jayson. I don’t think there is any pressure that he can’t handle, on or off the court. But I think on the court, I think him being able to play-make, almost having a triple-double and being the best player on the court is what he does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I’m pretty sure. Everybody was ready to go. It’s been a long stretch before we had this first game. We finally got that out of our system, so now we should be able to play for the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Of course. This is something that we can learn from and it can help us in the next game.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,Not necessarily difficult shots. We just have to communicate a lot better and just be better in our principles defensively. That’s what's going to help us withstand the stretch of the runs they made.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"I mean, he looked pretty healthy to me. We have to find a way to match his energy and physicality."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,They mostly play one-on-one. They send a lot of help. So that's why.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't remember. Just either you lose or you win. First to four, we've got to focus on the next game."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Of course. You want me to say we have no confidence? (Smiling).
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Of course.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, he was great for them. He was knocking down shots. He was blocking shots. So he was really, really huge for them on both ends of the floor."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Their spacing is great and they have a lot of shooters. So I think we have to do a better job taking those threes away.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,Just like I said right now. We've got to take those threes away. That's what hurt us the most.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just playing our basketball. I think in those moments, we were playing our basketball. We were getting stops. We didn't allow them to offensive rebound. We were having fun out there those couple moments, and that's what we've got to do more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Obviously this is a bigger stage. But those games, Finals prepare you for this moment. We pass Game 1. We didn't do our job well. So we've got to focus on the second one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Just focus on the next game. I think we really got good shots. We just didn't make them. But we've got to go game by game. The Game 1 is over. We've got to watch film, what we did wrong, and focus only on the next one."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, obviously, I think they are the best three-point shooting team in the NBA, so sometimes really hard to take those away. Especially when they have five guys out and they can all shoot. Obviously, we've got to make more. We didn't make enough shots today to beat them. But we've got to be better on both ends."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it's a full-team effort. Luka still had 30 and 10, so I got to do a better job. But it's a full-team effort and tonight I got lucky a few times, but we got to get ready for Game 2."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think defensively I thought we were -- we made some big-time plays. When they cut it to eight, that's when the game started. I liked how our team responded. We stayed composed. Offensively, we got to our spacing and was able to push that lead back out and make some plays on offense. That was a big third quarter."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"What was I feeling? Just trying to make some plays, get my team going. Defense is what we got to hang our hat on. Right there, that was an example of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It just depends. It just depends on who you're on, it just depends on the spacing of the game, and we got to be able to make plays, and right there, it was just -- I was the low guy, I was on some of those bigs, you don't want to give up lobs. That's one thing that we made an emphasis on. So I don't want to step up too much and give those lobs, but I was able to cat and mouse a little bit and then make some plays at the rim."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"That's the game right there. It's going to be -- it's not going to be perfect. It's a long series. I expect them Game 2 to come out with tremendous force and maybe try to hit us in the mouth. So that's the game. When a team goes on a run, you got to manage it, you got to stay composed, and you got to keep playing basketball. It's almost like you just have short-term memory a little bit, like the team's not even on a run. You got to play smart basketball and make great plays to get us on a -- get our flow back, and I think in that third quarter, I got to the free-throw line. I think that helped us get going. Then we made some kickouts to the corner. Al got a three. We was able to get some good offense going. But getting into that paint, being solid, being composed was what allowed us to push that lead back out."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"We just said, just breathe. The game is starting now. Just breathe. We're in -- this is a moment where our experience shines through. Just breathe, just keep playing basketball. If you got a shot that's open, take it with confidence, no turnovers, take care of the basketball and just play our game. We got to get some stops. They made some big shots. Just navigate the run. That was it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Two great additions between Kristaps and Jrue. In any given night it could be any of us. And Kristaps had a monster game for us and just his presence shooting the ball and then him being able to attack those switches and mismatches, he made 'em pay every time, and that's what we need going forward in the series. Kristaps was big, but those other guys, Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, JT, they all can get going at any point in time, so that's the beauty of our team. Every game has its own story. We just got to stay ready, stay composed, and take it one game at a time."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yes, I think Kristaps has been great for us all season long. I think he's a big reason why we've been the best team in basketball record-wise, at least, and having him back and him playing well and to that level he was during the season is so important for us because you got another defender, another shooter, out there that you have to respect. So that just opens it up for everybody else. Now, next game, I'm sure they will make adjustments. We got to be able to read it on the fly and make plays. Guys got to step up. We need guys like Sam, Payton, to come in and step up, JT. Everybody got to be ready to go."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,It means nothing. You just get ready for the next one.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, just trying to get to the paint. You know, get paint threats. That creates openness for our shooters. Just get to the throw free-throw line, take my time, and knock 'em down, and clean it up for the next game. But overall, that's what I've been doing all season long, is just getting to the paint, and that just opens up -- that puts a lot of pressure on the defense. We got a lot of guys that can shoot the ball. Making those reads and stuff is big for us, so got to continue to maintain that throughout the season, throughout the series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"It was amazing. Nobody's more proud and more excited for him than I am. But we got to get better, we got to, you know, almost forget about it and get ready for the next one. We can't be celebrating ourselves. Dallas is probably getting ready for the next game right now, so we got to prepare and get ready for the next one, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 6, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, was it the first or second quarter? He just went on a run where he just, he hit the three, hit the middy, then ran back, got the block at the rim in transition. He was just making play after play and it was just like, all right, he's back, there was no question about it then. We need some more that have going forward for the rest of this series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,They're two of the most talented guards this league has seen. It's going to be a challenge for all of us. It's not going to be one-on-one; we all have to participate. They're two of the best this league has ever seen. It's going to be a lot of fun. Just have to embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,Pray they miss (laughter). They're special. They make tough shots. You just got to try to make it difficult for them for 48 minutes and embrace that challenge.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"You got to know the personnel. You're just competing. We've been switching a lot all year. Whoever has that challenge, just got to know that it's not just you on an island; we're all going to be there behind them. Just embracing that challenge, competing and trying to make it as difficult as we can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I mean, obviously there's a lot of history between the two. I think once we get in between the lines and the game starts, it's just going to be a competitive game. We're just going to go out there and compete. I know he's going to do the same."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I think at the time we didn't have anybody who had any Finals experience. So obviously we've learned a lot from that Finals a couple years ago. Obviously adding KP and Jrue, all the experience they have. I think it's going to be different. Everybody is looking forward to it and embracing the challenge. This is the NBA Finals, it's what you dream about. It's going to be a challenge."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"I think everybody's excited, honestly. It's been a long break. A good week of practice. Everybody is looking forward to it. Like I said, this is what you dream about. Whatever it takes we got to be willing to do. We've been working for this moment the whole season."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,Yeah. It's going to be here tomorrow. It's going to be fun. There's going to be a lot going on. A big challenge and have fun with it.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"We didn't want to skip any steps the whole season. Obviously, the outside noise is going to be there no matter what we do. So this whole year we didn't want to skip steps. I think we did a really good job of that in the regular season and the postseason. Just continue to take it one day at a time, one game at a time. Just understand there are going to be ups, there's going to be downs. Just embrace it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"Yeah, I mean, you're here, you see all the banners, all the history. It's in our practice facility. You just dream about being part of that. Obviously the great history that the Celtics have. I think we all just embraced it and are thankful and grateful to be a part of this organization."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERRICK WHITE,"This is what it's all about here in Boston, this stage, this moment. We understand the challenges of it. We're just looking forward to it. We're going to have fun. There's going to be ups, there's going to be downs. We may lose, but we got to go out there and compete each and every night. Whatever it takes to get four wins."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I mean, it's crazy. This is like the biggest stage in basketball. To reach this point, have the opportunity to come out here and perform and help my team win the championship, it's an honor. Hopefully we can get it done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I would have the belief in myself that I could do it. I always dreamed of being in the NBA. I knew I worked really hard to make it. So I guess in a way, yeah, I believed in it. It's the only reason I would work every day like I did, I had the belief in that dream, so yeah."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I wasn't here when Kyrie was here but there's no bad blood. I think a lot of the guys that played with him have admired the way he plays the game. I definitely admire it, too. I take a lot of things. The way he plays basketball is very beautiful. He's an unbelievable player. There is no bad blood from us at all."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think it's the nature of Boston and the NBA. When a player leaves like that, fans and people can be frustrated. I think at this point we should just realize how good of a player he is and just give him his flowers for that aspect of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"It just helps that you've been through it. I think the difference this year, too, is we got a little bit more rest going into this series than the last time we were in the Finals. Just kind of the circus with the NBA Finals, the media, everything that comes with it. So just going through it realizing what the routine is going to be like. That helps. Just in the basketball game, I don't think it's any different necessarily than the playoff series we played before. Same thing, we getting up and down. Definitely helps, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"I think we have to realize they're unbelievable players, and we're going to try to make things very tough for them. You're never going to completely stop them. We're going to do our best."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",PAYTON PRITCHARD,"That's easy. The reason I fell in love with basketball in the first place is I watched Dwyane Wade win his first NBA Finals versus the Mavericks. I was really young at the time, I might have been seven, something like that. I can vividly remember watching them come back and how incredible he was that series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a huge moment. It's an honor. It's a blessing. It's one of those things you dream about, think about every preseason, every season, every postseason, every offseason. To be here now, it's something special. But just got to stay locked into the moment to be successful."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"It's a special place to play, especially an NBA Finals. I know the energy is going to be insane. Their fan base is one of the best, for sure. They're going to support their team. We're going to feed off the energy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,There might have been a few moments when I dreamed of the future to come back here like this. It's cool to be back here. Back then was a whirlwind. I was trying to survive.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"Yeah, it feels like a whole different era to me, a different time. It was in a lot of respects. Happy to be where I am. It's been a great journey. To be here now is a really special experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"He's a special player. Presence around the rim defensively, obviously can shoot from very deep. With his height, it's hard. Adds an element to those guys that we can definitely key in on and take into account. Scoring threat. As far as his time with us, we're going to compete. At the end of the day, we are good friends, have a good relationship. Looking forward to battling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,I'm not sure which story you're talking about.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DWIGHT POWELL,"Very brief. I think he's wearing the 77 very well. For a guy like him, I think it's very fitting to have a unique number. As one of the most unique players this league has seen, this game has seen, for him to have the number that kind of stands on its own, it's very fitting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Feeling good. It was a long road to get to this point for me. But feeling good. Looking forward to today's practice, moving around a little bit more, then being ready to go tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Of course, of course. Burns inside of me, you know, not being able to be out there. But tomorrow finally I'll get the chance and I'm excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, no, no, not cautious. I mean, no. I've came back from multiple injuries. I've had these first games back, of course not at this stage. At the end it's just basketball. Of course, the intensity is a little bit higher. I have to go out there and play like it's a basketball game, an important basketball game, and that's it. I don't need to think too much or, yeah, overthink. Just go out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, I'll play tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,I will play tomorrow.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, it's good. It's always been good. Yeah, as I said, he's one of the best players in the league, in the world. It will be a tough challenge for us to try to stop him. Just following his career when he came in the league, already made a huge impact. I had the opportunity to play with him for a couple years, get to know him. Just knowing what type of person he is, what type of player he is, his mindset, he's a special player. We have a big challenge ahead of us competing against somebody like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Yeah, no, I mean, I did everything, right? You have to check all the boxes to even get to this point. Of course, as I said, you cannot imitate the same intensity in practice as it's going to be tomorrow in the game. I have to feel confident to go out there and leave it all on the floor and expect that I'm going to be healthy and completely fine."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"No, obviously it's been tough. No, I've never felt like I'm not a part of this. I am a part of this. I've tried to be with the team, like, in any capacity I could. Guys so far have been, like, playing great, taking care of business, guys stepping up. Al has been unbelievable for us. Yeah, I just look forward to add more to complete the mission."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"It's going to be goose bumps, for sure, especially not playing for a while, then coming back in this kind of environment. It's going to be special. Going to be goose bumps, for sure. I'm really, really, really looking forward to it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KRISTAPS PORZINGIS,"Not all of it was, like, not good, right? We had some good moments. We had some decent moments. Yeah, overall I think it didn't work for both sides. It wasn't perfect. But, like, I would say everything, teammates, locker room, I know at that time there were some rumors there's like something in the locker room. It was never like that. It's all just noise at the end. It wasn't just perfect for us playing together, it didn't work out, that's it. We moved on. There's no, like, ill will from their side, for sure from my side. I don't think there should be. Just didn't work out. But I have nothing but love for Dallas and for the teammates and for everybody there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think he makes everyone's life easier. One, because of who he is as a person, the type of character he has. Your franchise player has to be a cornerstone of what you do. It starts with his high character, the way he carries himself, who he is as a dad, who he is as a teammate. His availability. He's there for every single practice, every single game. Loves being coached. Just carries himself the best way. There's no one like him. He's great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Right away. I think just all he cares about is winning. He's used the experiences he's had around the league. He's seen a lot, he's seen it all. He's seen success. He's seen tough times. He knows what the league is all about. I think at this point in his career, winning is the most important thing. But it's both sides, right? He had to do his part to fit in, but we had to do our part as a team, guys that have been here before, meet him where he's at because of his ability to play at such a high level. So I think it was just both."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I think it's more like the things that lead to success are the same. You're in locker rooms, regardless of the sport, even if you're in a company, everybody is saying the same thing. The things that go into winning, the things that go into success: Toughness, togetherness, connectivity, the mindset you bring. It's all the same. It's just a matter of getting the right group of people in the right spots, then just working to feed that mentality every single day. You can learn from anything and everything. You're trying to stay as open-minded as you can."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I mean, every year he just has the open-mindedness to get better. So if you have that, you're naturally going to be different. But also, like, from the first time we were there, he's been through other stuff. He's been through success, we've been through failures, we've won, lost, had pain, triumph. You use the things you've been through every single year to make yourself better on and off the court. That's kind of where we're all at as a team, using those goods and bads to use us for where we are right now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, he can process information. He can process situational basketball. He has an awareness of what's going on on the court. He has innate ability to communicate that in real-time because of his ability to just kind of take that all in. Who has the ball, who has the matchup, where is the help, what's the spacing, who can you help off of, when can you make a play. He has great instincts. That allows him to communicate at all times."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I would say this is not the end of the journey. The journey is for however long you're alive. This is just one piece to that. Regardless of what happens you got to wake up the next day and do your job. The journey will forever be there. You're just ready for it. You do everything within your control to prepare for it, mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. Tomorrow you just get after it. The game, the environment will tell us what we need to focus on, what we need to get better on and what we need to do. The most important thing is staying on a even keel and staying with poise. I think that's something our team has done a good job of doing all year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"I had a good seat, great perspective in that. I think the biggest thing you learn is what goes into winning in the NBA Finals is the same as the last series, series before that, regular season, preseason, practice, training camp. It's the details, the execution, the ability to take your mindset and your body to the next level. The toughest team will win. The team that makes the most plays will win. The team that can execute the details at a high level will win. It's no different. The biggest thing we took as we were going through that series against the Warriors, the things we kept coming back to were the things we kept talking about the entire year - the margins, details, fundamentals, the way you go about executing at a high level."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, I think that's not the only moment that those guys are using to get better. The coolest thing about where Jaylen has been is his surrender to anything external and the most important thing is his growth and development as a person and as a player. That's all he cares about, is getting better. I think that's been really cool to see. I think it's the same for Jayson. You can pick numerous experiences that everybody in our locker room has been through that you need to be able to use for the situation we're in now. That will remain the same for the rest of our careers. I think it's all about using what you've been through good, bad, indifferent, to help you in the present moment. The guys are doing it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, unless they change the light bulbs in the arenas, they won't be any brighter than they were the last series. It's just sticking to the details, the things that matter, the truth. The truth of the matter is if you don't box out, if you don't sprint back in transition, if you don't pass the ball in a two-on-one, if you don't take away the other team's tendencies, if you don't know who you're guarding, don't recognize the spacing, if you don't talk, if you don't play hard, you're not going to win. Focusing on the most simple things and the truth, the truth of the matter is you have to do those things. You have to do them at a high level. Obviously the stakes are higher, that just means that the details are more important."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOE MAZZULLA,"Yeah, I mean, everybody in the organization is a leader in their own way. Everybody sets the temperature when they come in. Brad giving me my start, hiring me, empowering me from day one as an assistant, giving me some of the opportunities that he has. But also the way he carries himself. I've always had a lot of respect for how he went about coaching, how he kept family balance number one. How he treated people number one. That was always more important than whether there was a success or a failure. I think he spearheads the leadership, the temperature of the building, just as everybody else does."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"A whole lot of trust, just a whole lot of communication. In life, you could think someone has your back, but you're never really going to know unless it happens in game play. You get blown by, you see your teammate putting his body on the line for you, makes you just want to do that much more."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard not to, right? Got to be able to adapt to every situation you're putting yourself in. Whenever you're shooting, doing layup lines and stuff like that, you turn around, there's 150 people with cameras, all you got to do is just smile away."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I mean, it's hard to treat it like every other game because there's a level of urgency. We're more focused on each and every individual fact that we can, no matter if that's defensive coverages, offensive game plan, what we need to do to come out and throw the first punch."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It's definitely been a journey, man. I feel like it hasn't even been a year, but it feels like three. I feel like I've matured, I've grown up, and I've grown a lot as a person and as an individual."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Just understanding I'm going to get them into their spots. Whenever they have three people on them, you just got to understand put yourself in the ability where they can see you, and they going to get the ball to you because they're always going to draw two or two and a half people. It's just finding little holes in the defense and slowly being able to not be as aggressive but try to get them open so they can get you open, and you're going to get your shots. It's not always going to be me, people in the corner open, people at the top of the three that's open. Just be able to move the ball and find the right shot."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"It makes you play with a certain level of aggressiveness and freedom. You put your life on the line out there. You put your body and your soul on the line in this 94 feet so you can win a basketball game. We're talking about basketball. Are you going to go out on the court and be scared of anybody because it's a basketball game? No. I feel like there's a lot of things in life, a lot of fears in life that I've had to meet over this past year, and it's caused me to be that much more confident in myself, being in such a tight-knit, intense moments."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"I feel like the Boston Celtics has always been a franchise that has a lot of respect, has had a lot of talent, has had a lot of people come in and left their mark here. It just makes it that much more of an experience for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DERECK LIVELY II,"Their voice is law. If you're on bullsh-- they're going to call you out. At the same time, they have the same respect for you if they're on bullsh-- and you're supposed to call them out. I feel like they both act younger than me off the court. They're both joking, joyous, trying to put a smile on everybody's face. But whenever it comes to on the court, there's a certain switch that they turn on. You can see it in their eyes. The kill mentality, just go out there and hoop, go out there and get the best shot, go out there and try to be the best basketball player possible."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"It's not game day yet, but it's obviously very special to be here. This is what you dream of, just making it here. As a team, we have our ups and downs during the season, but we deserve to be here. We want to take advantage of that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"There’s a little bit of a history, so I think it will be very energetic. But that's why we are mentally prepared. We just have to keep the composure, focus on ourselves, what we have to do. Play with the same energy that we had in the last games."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"The days off obviously helped. I had a little bit more time to get treatment in and work on strength and everything else, also on conditioning. Overall feeling great."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I mean, it's the Playoffs, so there's limited time. You get back and get the amount, the reps, practice. But we did a great job I think of ramping it up before that. Also the minutes were kind of restricted, too. We tried to make the best out of it. It's not ideal, but it's what you got to live with. I think we did a great job overall of pushing with the right pace."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"Yeah, I think especially after winning the Western Conference Finals it's a thought that you have. Now it’s really game to game, you can't get too excited because it's a lot of ups and downs for each individual game, for the whole series. You just got to stay locked in and prepare the same way for every game, keep your composure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"No, it's just like to stabilize it a little bit, some comfort for the shoulder. Nothing to get adjusted to, or change. No big changes here."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",MAXI KLEBER,"I think every series that we play prepared us a little bit for that because we had other lineups against Minnesota where they had five guys that shot. I think we have a really strong defensive core now, with Gafford and Lively playing big. I think they're also doing a great job. Overall we have so many defensive possibilities, lineups that we can throw out there, without having big disadvantages. It will change a little bit because they play a little bit more five-out. Obviously, the rotations, defensive rotations, will be a little bit different. That's why we worked on it for a long time. Hopefully we can just adjust to it in the game tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"No, when you talk about it didn't work, did it work, I only had him for a short period of time. I thought it was going well in the sense of our defense, his ability to block shots, rebound. Then offensively we looked to post him up a little bit more than Rick [Carlisle] had used him in the post, which was strictly on the perimeter shooting threes. Both worked. He has the skill set to do both. As you know, in the business of basketball, there's trades that take place. We're judged if it works or doesn't work. That's just part of the business. For the short period I had him, I really enjoyed KP. Great, great on the floor, great off the floor. Did everything we asked."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Again, his game, when you talk a big who can put the ball on the floor, who can score, I believe can play in the post. In today's game there's a lot of threes, not a lot of post-up."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Well, you said that, Eddie. I did not (smiling). We believe he's super athletic. But when you talk about basketball IQ, everybody has different levels. When you look at Luka's level of understanding the game, time and score, who's on the floor, he is at the head of the class in that sense."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"Yeah, I think you do have to experience it. I think that's the nicer way to accept losing, is that you have to go through it. It's a graceful way to accept losing. But you do have to, again, go through defeat to understand that bad taste, how do you feel, how does it make you feel, to work on your game, to get better. There are times when you're just not good enough. As a player, unfortunately with the Nets, we played the Lakers, we weren't just good enough and we got swept. There are some cases that you run into Shaq and Kobe. You got to just take defeat and then move on. We did bounce back to come back. But I think you do. Jayson and Brown have gone through defeat. We also lost to the Warriors, too, that year. The Warriors are really good. But they learned something. You could see they're playing at a high level right now, winning 64 games, the best team in the NBA. To be penciled in at the beginning of the season, that puts a little pressure or stress because you're supposed to be here. They fulfilled that. But that tandem, they're playing at an extremely high level and we got our work cut out. But they've been here. Some of us for the Mavs have been here, some of us haven't. We're going to embrace that and find a way to hopefully win a series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JASON KIDD,"It's simple: talent. Sometimes you don't have enough talent. As I brought up the Lakers and Nets, we were happy to be there, but we just didn't have enough talent to beat Kobe and Shaq. It could be that simple. But nerves sometimes play a part, too. Just the human side of things. But at the end of the day, as much as we've talked about it, to embrace it, to stay steady, and to enjoy this time because you're not promised anything to come back the following year. To do everything, this isn't a vacation. This is a road trip in the sense of a job. We have an opportunity here to find a way to win on the road. That's how we're approaching it. This is the best of the best at the highest level. It's fun. That's what the Finals are all about, is seeing what team is going to step forward and take advantage of mistakes."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I did. Is that the first question (smiling)? Oh, God, I love it. Got to love this, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"I mean, I have a great reaction. It's appreciated. There's a lot of gratitude there, as well. Obviously, I'm in a different age, different place in my life. So is he. I think we both have been able to mature and really appreciate what we got a chance to accomplish. I think there were some things that got in the way of our relationship when I was a little bit younger. Now that I'm able to vocalize how I feel as a man, be comfortable in it, stand on my square, my beliefs, where I'm coming from, I feel like our relationship's different because of that now. Definitely miss him. Playing out there, just making things easier, being able to run up and down the floor, just throw the ball to somebody like that, throw it in the air, as athletic as they come. Yeah, just a mutual respect there for what we brought to the table. His leadership, my leadership style, I think it meshed very well. I was learning a lot from him that I'm appreciative for the rest of my life. Man, when he says comments like that, I think back to us having those moments where we're down in a series, up in a series, we're really demanding greatness from each other. Off the court, our families meshing well. I definitely think about those times. Now we're here in the present where we're able to reflect but also now I'm at this stage, able to use some of the formulas that I was taught from him, some of the great teachers that have come before me. I feel like I've been built for this moment because I've gone through some of the things I've gone through in my past with some of the guys that have transcended the game. Shout-out to LeBron for that. Knows how to stir up a media storm, get everybody in here talking about us. Yeah, I'm looking forward to the future and getting this series started now."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, it is a fleeting feeling, to be real with you. There's so many peers of mine that have spent long years in the NBA trying to make it to the NBA Finals, Western Conference Finals, Eastern Conference Finals. Have gotten very close or almost struggled or strived every year to get back. I had a chance to do it in my fourth year, my fifth year, my sixth year. When I look back at those memories, never regretful of how I treated it, but a little disappointed on how I approached just that success. I wanted to be able to enjoy it and take a breather, really take in the moment. You're in the middle of a 76-year history. I'm in the middle of a 76-year history now, but then we were in years of history. The NBA is very young still as a business. When you ascend to this level, put in a lot of hard work, you beat some of the best in the world, competing with some of the best in the world. I looked at it as, oh I'm going to be here every single year. At this age I've been through what I've been through, been able to come out on the other side. I look at it as an opportunity that I don't want to take for granted. I want it to last as long as possible emotionally just because of how much it took to get here. These young guys are very hungry. They want a championship. I want a championship. So our feelings are very mutual. But I've always reminded them that this is a process. Failure is going to be part of this, too. Get it out your mind that this is about to be a clean sweep or everything is about to feel good throughout this journey and all that. I'm just very real, very honest. That's what's helped me grow as a leader, accepting what I can't control, and what I can't, letting it lay to the wayside. Letting that go, how it's going to go, that's life. Basketball has been a great teacher for me, but life has been an even better one. Using those same principles I've learned in life apply to basketball has allowed me to connect to my teammates better. There's no silent treatment that's coming randomly throughout the year because I don't know how to emotionalize or vocalize how I'm feeling. Some of the things I struggled with as a young player, I've now been able to accept this is what comes with being in this position. Taking on the pressure. Then also teaching my teammates how to get through it. Also look them to teach mere. Just staying a student and enjoying the craft, man."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Man, shot out to God Shammgod. He's been imperative in just helping me grow, enjoying the game every single day, competing. I feel like he's just one of my uncles just from Harlem, New York, that's there to give me a little s--- when I need it but be honest all the time. Remind me this is bigger than basketball. Shout-out to God Shammgod. He's helped me a lot this year, been there every single day to help work me out. Also inspire the next generation. He does it in his own way. I'm just following his footsteps, just like other uncles of mine who have done great things in this world."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",KYRIE IRVING,"Yeah, I mean, I've experienced Boston twofold: my first few years being in the NBA playing for the Cavs, then coming here to Boston, then being right down the street in Brooklyn, now being here in the Finals playing against them in a potential four-to-seven-game series. You just got to breathe through it. To all my youngins out there that are dealing with some of the crowd reactions, what they're saying to you, you have to breathe, realize that is not as hostile as you think it is. Don't overthink it. Been able to work through that and understand that some of that is anxiety, some of that is nervousness. It could all be turned into a strength. There's no fear out here, man. It's basketball. The fans are going to say what they're going to say. I appreciate them and their relationship they have to the game. But it's about the players at the end of the day. Then the first question was? Oh, playing against my former brothers. Yeah, no, I'm excited. They've gotten tremendously better. They've led their team to this point. So I'm proud of them. I'm looking forward to the competition because this is what we've all strived for since we were kids, basketball at this level playing against the best of the best. They have a great team over there, led by a great coach. So we're going to be in for a great series, hard, tough series. They're going to give us their best. I know they're not going to slow down when they see me. They're going to come at me even more. This is what I've been preparing for since last summer or when our season ended last year of putting in the time to prepare for moments like this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Just really excited. Just excited to be in this position. At the beginning of camp, that's all we've been talking about, being in this position again. I'm just grateful. Right now, just trying to take this experience in of the Media Day, per se. It's just a fun time, a fun time for me."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I'm enjoying it. This is a part of it. I feel like the first time we went through it, I feel like it was a bit overwhelming, just a lot going on. This time around, I feel like we all understand it a little better. I'm very appreciative to be in this position."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, just continuing to stay consistent in the things that I did, coming in, working out individually, doing our team stuff when we needed to. It was just for a longer, extended period of time. Staying really locked in. I think the first day I took a day off right after Indiana, Game 4. After that, I just continued with my routine, continued to stay ready, taking advantage of the time. For me, this time off, I feel like it's been good to get me as prepared as best I can for tomorrow."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"It's great. He's obviously a very big part of what we do. Just everything that he brings on the floor. He's a threat offensively. As we know, he shoots it, he can post, he protects the rim for us. It's just a really good thing for us to be able to have him back."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,I'm excited. I know I'm excited. I know our fans are even more excited. It's the Finals. They're going to be rowdy. They're going to get after it. 8:30 start. I'm just happy. I can't wait until tomorrow. I can't wait to see them bring that energy.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"I think it's a thing. I think so. I think being in this position, this situation, everything we have to manage, it can be overwhelming your first time dealing with all this."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"The good thing about playing for the Boston Celtics is that the expectation is always there. When I came here eight years ago, this is what I came here for, for these kind of moments. What you say is pressure, nobody is going to put pressure on themselves more than we do, more than I do individually myself. I'm just really excited for this opportunity."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",AL HORFORD,"Yeah, I mean, I feel like he's looked good. Kristaps, he's more of a gamer. I know when the game comes around, if he says he's playing, he's going to be ready to roll."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"You do your best to stay away. Your mental health is probably the biggest thing, especially playing in the NBA Finals. But not only that, I mean, everybody gets scrutinized, right? When I was in Milwaukee, it was about Giannis not having enough help the first two games, whatever. The pressure that J.B. and J.T. have to take on is something different. I've told them this before, but it's really impressive how they handle themselves, how they stay professional, how they still come out every game and do what they do. Yeah, I think it's extremely impressive how they do that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Pray (smiling). No, I think it's just familiarity. Just I think knowing each other's game, doing your best to stay in front of him, trying to take away the things that will probably hurt you the most. Probably most of all having help. Him being able to see multiple guys on the court, making it look like it's crowded, making shots as tough as possible, even though he's a tough shot-maker, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I think he's always been great, to be honest. I do think play-making, he's done a really good job, and that's something I never really saw from him before. He's never afraid to take the big shot. He's never been afraid of that big moment. I think making the right plays in moments is something I've noticed since I've been his teammate."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"One thing, the talent. I know sometimes talent doesn't always mesh together. This does. You saw it during the regular season. You've seen it throughout the playoffs, how any given night everybody is just unselfish. I feel like we sacrifice for each other. That's kind of what makes it go. Then I think it's just the will to win. I think this team really wants to win. I know they've been to the Eastern Conference Finals a million times. They've been to the Finals. They've been to the top, just didn't execute the way they wanted to. Now that we're here, we want to get the job done."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"He never wants to sit out. He never wants to sit out. I've played with a lot of players. When you have your best player who wants to play every single game, takes the game that seriously, even if they're banged up with an ankle, knee, whatever it is, still goes out there and plays, I think it shows a lot. Not only him as a basketball player, but his character, so..."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not for me. I would just like to add to it. I think to be a part of history would be cool, especially a history that the Celtics have and everything that comes with it. Again, I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team. But to add to that is I feel like a part of the reason why I was brought here, the part of reason why I wanted to come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I saw something or somebody told me said they started from the bottom, literally at the bottom, now they're at the top. That's really cool to see, especially playing against both of 'em during the season with their previous teams, seeing their role, how it went for them, then watching them in the Playoffs, being intricate, huge parts of why their team is so successful. It's really cool to see. They definitely are energy guys. They're guys that mesh well with that team and really make them go. It's going to be a challenge for us to stop them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",THE MODERATOR,"Thanks, Jrue."

2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"Not for me. I would just like to add to it. I think to be a part of history would be cool, especially a history that the Celtics have and everything that comes with it. Again, I would say that I probably don't take a bulk of the pressure because we have Jayson and Jaylen on our team. But to add to that is I feel like a part of the reason why I was brought here, the part of reason why I wanted to come."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JRUE HOLIDAY,"I saw something or somebody told me said they started from the bottom, literally at the bottom, now they're at the top. That's really cool to see, especially playing against both of them during the season with their previous teams, seeing their role, how it went for them, then watching them in the Playoffs, being intricate, huge parts of why their team is so successful. It's really cool to see. They definitely are energy guys. They're guys that mesh well with that team and really make them go. It's going to be a challenge for us to stop them."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, it's pretty special. Trying not to take it for granted. Not everyone gets this opportunity. So just trying to make the most of it, especially being on the path that I've been on. It's been like a wild ride almost. But it's been cool. Just trying to cherish every moment. You never know how long it's going to last."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I definitely did not think early on I could get to this point in the NBA. I honestly didn't really know until I found a two-way contract and was able to show or improve myself here. It's been a lot of hard work, for sure. Like I said before, I just try never to take it for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"There's nothing like tangible that I switch out in my workouts or anything. It's just trying to stay confident, maybe going back and looking at highlights where I'm on a heater or something like that. Just to know that, like, I'm still the same guy, it's just shots aren't going in sometimes. It happens to everybody in this game. That's why you play the game of basketball. That's why it's a team sport, not just an individual sport. I try to impact the game other ways. Obviously shooting is the loud impact that I make. But I always know that water finds its level. It usually regresses to the mean. Shots are bound to start falling."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Sometimes I just search up my name and watch the first couple videos that come up. Sometimes when you're in a hole or a slump like that, you just need something to bring you out of it."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"I think we're just excited to get going. I think, I don't know, it's been eight or nine days since we played our last game. Everybody is anxious to get back on the court, play in front of these fans. I know the Garden is going to be rocking tomorrow. We're excited."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",SAM HAUSER,"Yeah, well, I think we all had a goal at the start of the year. We wanted to be at this point. I think each day we just treated it as its own entity, not look too far ahead. We knew we had the talent, but it's more of like we got to go show it and prove it. Now we're here. We definitely celebrated getting back here, but now we're laser focused for tomorrow. Hopefully going to come out on top this time as opposed to two years ago."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,This experience is amazing. I look at it as a blessing. A lot of people play their careers and never get a chance to play in the Finals. I would never take this for granted. I'm just super grateful to be here. Can't wait to get started.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Kyrie has helped all of us, those going through this the first time. He told us to just stay in the moment, lean on each other. We're all brothers. Just being there for each other. Stand together, stick together, trusting each other."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, that experience was super fun, to have the opportunity to go out there and play on the highest stage in the Playoffs, be able to perform. I was super grateful. I want to thank God for all of the blessings that He's blessed me with."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"All that confidence comes from hours in the gym, late nights, just having confidence in my abilities. When I go out there, I feel like I'm confident in my ability to go out there and perform."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"I don't look it as an underdog. I feel like we have a bunch of guys that are hungry, I would say that. We have a bunch of guys that are hungry and ready for this moment. We're not going to take this for granted."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"I feel like with the pace we play with, I feel like with our bigs, how athletic they are, I feel like we have good depth with our team."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, I think about it. I've been thinking about it every day, how these days just keep approaching. It's getting closer and closer. I'm just super excited to get out there and hoop."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JADEN HARDY,"Yeah, it's going to be a lot of energy in this building. It's probably going to be hostile. We already know what is expected. We going to come in hungry and ready to fight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"This is awesome. I've dreamed of this opportunity as a kid, my whole life. It's something you work for. I think being here now, it's amazing. It's bright lights. I think the guys are ready to go. It's been our number one goal since the season started."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think the history says it for itself. Like I said, everyone is excited. It's one of my favorite places to play in the NBA. I'm looking forward to it. The rest of the guys are, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I think we obviously respect them a lot as a team. They're a great team, coached amazing. I think everyone we faced in the Playoffs has been a great challenge for us. I think it adds to that. It's exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"It's weird, man. Looking back at it, it's crazy. There's so many times in my career, whether it's high school, college, it felt like everything was going the wrong way in life. Especially my first couple years in the NBA. To be able to reflect on this and see where we are as a team nowadays, it's super fun. It's exciting. It continues to motivate me. I still feel like I'm young in my career. But, yeah, it's good."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"I mean, I knew I'd be on it in like in 2K or something or playing My Career as a kid growing up, always dreaming of being in the Finals. But I think it's hard to say I knew I'd be here. Where I come from in Australia, Castle Hill, you dream of stuff like this. Pretty sure the little me would be very happy with myself. I would say I worked very hard to get where I'm at, though."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"Yeah, the atmosphere is amazing here in the regular season, so I can only imagine what it's going to be like tomorrow night. It's going to get the adrenaline going. It's going to be exciting."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JOSH GREEN,"He means everything. Kyrie has been an amazing leader for not only me but everyone else on the team. He's competitive. Since day one, all sights have been on making it to the Finals. It's not only Kyrie. Kyrie is a great leader. Luka is a great leader. All the team has been so tight."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Being confident and being pretty much prepared for anything, 'because nine times out of ten I'll be out on the perimeter a lot more defending. Just being comfortable in that situation. There's going to be times when I'm out on the perimeter, in the paint, protecting the basket. There's going to be a lot of stuff thrown at us. Being comfortable in that situation, being confident I make sure I make those reads and being able to rotate defensively."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Hmm. Just coming out, setting the tone. We got a lot of energy around this team. We got a great atmosphere around this team. If we come out with our heads on straight, I feel like it's going to be a pretty good situation."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"What's crazy, when I got traded, we were actually headed here to play Boston. I got to the practice facility. (Wizards General Manager) Will Dawkins called me and said there's a possibility you'll be going to Dallas. I said, okay, let me know. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes. He called me and said, You've been traded to Dallas. I would say when it comes to the emotions of getting traded, you could be mad, you could be happy. I would say I didn't really have a crazy reaction to it because I've been in the situation before. I just took this as a point, one door closed, another door opened for me. So this is another opportunity for me to kind of like progress throughout my career. I just wanted to make sure I most definitely took the right approach to it. I didn't really want to think too much on it. Like I said, it's another opportunity for me. I just took this as this is another step down my path of success."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Oh, man, the first game when we were there, Luka threw the first lob to me. The crowd went crazy. The Dallas crowd reminds me a lot Bud Walton Arena when I was in college, for sure. Just being in that atmosphere like that, love and energy throughout the arena. It's just something that I felt like I missed just throughout my career, for sure."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Pretty much the same. Go out and stay confident and comfortable when it comes to just like the position we're going to be in defensively. Offensively, not letting them speed us up. They got a lot out of veteran defenders -- Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, he's around the basket blocking shots. There's a lot of guys that are guards that can block shots, too."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Honestly, one of the best human beings to be around. When I got here to now, just seeing how he carries himself, how he talks. One of the best people to be around. He embraces everything he's been through, and he's found ways to just improve and progress from that. I've heard him talk about when he was here, transitioning to Brooklyn. He said he learned a lot. It takes a lot of just like humble and humility just to go through something like that. I would say he's one of the best people in the world to be around, because everybody has had some type of situation. You see me at my worst. You never pay attention to just like the progress of how I'm trying to better myself."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"Because we are players. That's the main thing, in my opinion. Because we're players. We see him as a teammate, we see him as an opponent. At the end of the day, he is the same person on the court and off the court."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANIEL GAFFORD,"There's a lot of great memories with KP. I always used to expect to come in and have a challenge day in and day out going against him in practice. He's one of the guys that used to always, like, motivate me when it came to the things that I did on the floor. I really appreciated him with certain areas that he helped me progress in. He helped me a lot defensively, too, guarding a guy of his height, a guy that shoots over you. You crawl up into his airspace, he still shoots over you. Finding a way to make that not happen was something I always focused on every day going into practice."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's a little different because it's the middle of the day. Obviously, I remember growing up, I wasn't able to watch it being at school. I mean, it's something that everyone watches. I know they have watch parties all over the country. It's a big event and everyone watches it down there."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, you could have asked me two years ago if I was going to be here, I would have been shocked. I think it's kind of the hard work and dedication that I've put into my game. Staying focused throughout it all, through the ups and downs, injuries. Making sure I always got back to just loving basketball, just wanting to be on the court. Obviously, when I got this opportunity in Dallas, jump on it. I knew we had a good team, but to even look at a year ago and say I'd be here, it's crazy."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"I mean, yeah, you always dream about it. I think just being a kid from Australia, even getting to the NBA was a big thing. More and more guys are doing it now, so it's becoming a thing that a lot of kids growing up look at it like, I can do that, it's not so farfetched. It's definitely something you look at, yeah, I did not see this. It's just hard work and you continue to grind every year."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, we've been here during the season, kind of the hostility they showed toward Kyrie. They're just passionate. I'm all for it. I love it. They just want their team to win. It's going to be the same when they go to Dallas. It's just going to be a fun series."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",DANTE EXUM,"Yeah, it's peaks and valleys. The biggest thing I've done is try not to get too high on the highs and low on the lows. There were some very lows. I think I used everything as an opportunity to get better or as a challenge. Definitely going to Europe helped propel my game, build confidence, be a leader on a team of young guys. I think that helped me a lot, to get me to where I am today."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I don't really know. I don't know why it didn't work out. We were still both young. We tried to make it work, but it just didn't work. So moved on."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"I mean, his leadership is amazing. The way he connects us. I think me and Kyrie are the leaders of this team, but he's the one that's been in the Finals. He's the one that won in the Finals. He's the one that is really leading it. He's keeping us all together and motivated."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Some things he's done, I mean, especially in practice, it's insane. The things he even tries in the game, it's insane. I never seen nobody make those shots. I don't see nobody try those shots. Obviously we know the handles. Just some shots are crazy. It's amazing just to experience this live."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, I think we'll see how my knee is. But if it's a good, I'm going to go play, yeah. More games. You forgot, what was it, World Cup before the season (smiling)."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Amazing. First time here. Hopefully it's not the last game. But never take it for granted. You never know if you are going to come back, so just enjoy the experience."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,I think it's very loud crowd. Everybody knows that. They been known for that. It's hard to play in this place. The crowd is amazing for their team. All I got to say is we got to stay together. It's us against them. We got to stay together. But it's going to be really hard to play in this crowd.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it speaks a lot. You seen more examples, too. But I think they fit perfectly with us. The trade made us a so much better team, especially on the defensive end. So, they're in the perfect roles that we need."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",LUKA DONCIC,"Yeah, it was I remember it, it was quarterfinals of EuroLeague against Panathinaikos in Panathinaikos. The crowd went crazy. They started winning 20-0. Imagine that (smiling)."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Well, I think it was, like, five questions (smiling). I think it was great. Definitely learned a lot from Kyrie while he was here. It's been great to see his journey, see where he's at, all the stuff he's going through, stuff like that, to be where he's at it's amazing, it's dope to see."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, you learn and grow from your experiences, from being a 25-year-old to being a 27-year-old is a big difference. Yeah, I'm 27 (smiling). You learn from those experiences. We got a different team. We got a different coach, too, as well. We had Ime Udoka; now we have Joe Mazzulla. We had Marcus Smart, Rob Williams; we have Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis. Different team, different coach two years later makes a pretty big difference."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think Brad has been great in his role as GM. He was a great coach. I think he just continued that by just being a great GM, being able to put the right pieces together and things like that. Just happy for him. His schedule has been able to settle down, probably putting a little bit less stress on him than we did when he was coaching us. But, no, Brad has been great since he's been a part of the Boston organization. He's helped bring this organization back in terms of winning. He's now been able to move into that GM position and put the right pieces together to get us back to the Finals."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"How often? I've watched it a few times now, maybe four or five times. As well as last year's conference finals. I think you can always learn from anything really. But just being able to watch those moments and learn from them, how to manage your emotions, like, what you would have did differently potentially. I don't think that's bad to look at and acknowledge and be aware of. So I would say a few times at least I've watched the Finals, the whole thing, all the way through."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Two different people. Two different guys. Joe's got his own style. Ime has his own style. Both were great coaches. Joe has been able to emphasize what we wanted to be offensively. We're with Joe a little bit longer. Joe had an interim year. Now this is his second year in a sense. Ime only had one year. So it's hard to really compare, contrast, to be honest."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, I mean, D-White has been great all season long. He's been aggressive. We've empowered him. He's primed for these moments. We want him to come out and recognize when it's his time to strike. We feel comfortable with him doing so because he's been doing it all season long."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think it's fair. I think it's a fair question. I think it's fair to say that it does affect you being embraced versus being scrutinized. One of my favorite quotes is, like, The child who isn't embraced by the village, something like that, you will, what is it? Y'all know this quote, right? You will feel like the warmth. The child that doesn't feel the warmth of the village will burn it down, something like that."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"Yeah, whatever. Neither here nor there (smiling). But, you know, referencing that, you get to a point where it's, like, you get scrutinized enough for a large part of your career, it becomes normal. Then it just rolls off you. For me, at least, I can say. I don't know if Jayson feels the same way. It's kind of been that my whole career in a sense. Just being booed when you were drafted to saying you were overpaid, saying you were overpaid again. It's been that the whole journey for me. It just becomes another headline."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",JAYLEN BROWN,"I think that's a great question, as well. I think this is a special group. I really do. The core group of it has been here for a few years now. We've been able to go through the experiences of having success but not having success at the same time. I think to solidify the ultimate goal is to get over the hump and win. I think that will add a lot to our legacy. But as of right now, that story is kind of still untold."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"It means a lot. It's a real testament to my hard work, all the time I put in in the gym. I tell myself this is where I want to be, this is where I want to play at. Being here is great. It's a blessing, especially getting here right now. Something I've been dreaming of my whole life."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"I wouldn't say natural. I look at all the videos, but just a lot of trying to learn stuff. It's kind of turned into a hobby."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"I feel like now in the NBA you kind of have to expect stuff like that with the way that teams play, especially the way we play. We have guys, sometimes J.T. is at the five. Myself, as well. We can throw anything out there. Just be prepared, be ready for anything."
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,I've been doing that for a while. I think college. I played it in college sometimes. In high school. Because I was always the tallest guy. I can guard one through five. Feel like switching up is easy for me always.
2024 - NBA FINALS: CELTICS VS. MAVERICKS,"June 5, 2024",OSHAE BRISSETT,"No, that's always been in me. I love basketball. I love playing basketball. Before anything, I was a fan of basketball. I liked watching. All of my brothers played. It started from that. Now being here on the biggest stage, some of the best players in the world, that's just who I am. I love staying engaged. It helps me stay focused, stay locked in. It's just something that, for me, helps me. I also know it helps the guys out there."
